    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nCompany Overview\nWe are North America\u2019s largest \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d moving and storage operator through our subsidiary U-Haul International, Inc. (\u201cU-Haul\u201d). U-Haul is synonymous with \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d moving and storage and is a leader in supplying products and services to help people move and store their household and commercial goods. Our primary service objective is to \u201cprovide a better and better product and service to more and more people at a lower and lower cost.\u201d Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms \u201cAMERCO,\u201d \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d refer to AMERCO, a Nevada corporation, and all of its legal subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis.\nWe were founded in 1945 as a sole proprietorship under the name \"U-Haul Trailer Rental Company\" and have rented trailers ever since. Starting in 1959, we rented trucks on a one-way and in-town basis exclusively through independent U-Haul \u00ae dealers. In 1973, we began developing our network of U-Haul \u00ae managed retail stores, through which we rent our trucks and trailers, self-storage units and portable moving and storage units and sell moving and self-storage products and services to complement our independent dealer network.\nWe rent our distinctive orange and white U-Haul \u00ae trucks and trailers as well as offer self-storage units through a network of 2,065 Company-operated retail moving stores and over 20,100 independent U-Haul \u00ae dealers. We also sell U-Haul \u00ae brand boxes, tape and other moving and self-storage products and services to \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d moving and storage customers at all of our distribution outlets and through our uhaul.com \u00ae and eMove \u00ae websites.\nWe believe U-Haul \u00ae is the most convenient supplier of products and services addressing the needs of the United States and Canada\u2019s \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d moving and storage markets. Our broad geographic coverage throughout the United States and Canada and our extensive selection of U-Haul \u00ae brand moving equipment rentals, self-storage units, portable moving and storage units and related moving and storage products and services provide our customers with convenient \u201cone-stop\u201d shopping.\nSince 1945, U-Haul \u00ae has incorporated sustainable practices into its everyday operations. We believe that our basic business premise of equipment sharing helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduces the inventory of total large capacity vehicles. We continue to look for ways to reduce waste within our business and are dedicated to manufacturing reusable components and recyclable products. We believe that our commitment to sustainability, through our products and services and everyday operations has helped us to reduce our impact on the environment.\nThrough Repwest Insurance Company (\u201cRepwest\u201d) and ARCOA Risk Retention Group (\"ARCOA\"), our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries, we manage the property, liability and related insurance claims processing for U-Haul \u00ae . Oxford Life Insurance Company (\u201cOxford\u201d), our life insurance subsidiary, sells life insurance, Medicare supplement insurance, annuities and other related products to the senior market.\nAvailable Information\nAMERCO \u00ae and U-Haul \u00ae are each incorporated in Nevada. The internet address for U-Haul is uhaul.com. On AMERCO\u2019s investor relations website, amerco.com, we post the following filings as soon as practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d): our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements related to meetings of our stockholders, and any amendments to those reports or statements filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). We also use our investor relations website as a means of disclosing material information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. All such filings on our website are available free of charge. Additionally, you will find these materials on the SEC\u2019s website at sec.gov.\nProducts and Rental Equipment\nOur customers are primarily \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d household movers. U-Haul \u00ae moving equipment is specifically designed, engineered and manufactured for the \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d household mover. These \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d movers include individuals and families moving their belongings from one home to another, college students moving their belongings, vacationers and sports enthusiasts needing extra space or having special towing needs, people trying to save on home furniture and home appliance delivery costs, and \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d home remodeling and gardening enthusiasts who need to transport materials.\nAs of March 31, 2020, our rental fleet consisted of approximately 176,000 trucks, 127,000 trailers and 41,000 towing devices. This equipment and our U-Haul brand of self-moving products and services are available through our network of managed retail moving stores and independent U-Haul dealers. Independent U-Haul dealers receive rental equipment from the Company, act as rental agents and are paid a commission based on gross revenues generated from their U-Haul \u00ae rentals.\nOur rental truck chassis are engineered by domestic truck manufacturers. These chassis are joined with the U-Haul \u00ae designed and manufactured van boxes primarily at U-Haul \u00ae operated manufacturing and assembly facilities strategically located throughout the United States. U-Haul \u00ae rental trucks feature our proprietary Lowest Deck SM , which provides our customers with extra ease of loading. The loading ramps on our trucks are the widest in the industry, which reduce the effort needed to move belongings. Our trucks are fitted with convenient, padded rub rails with tie downs on every interior wall. Our Gentle Ride Suspension SM helps our customers safely move delicate and prized possessions. Also, the engineers at our U-Haul Technical Center determined that the softest ride in our trucks was at the front of the van box. Consequently, we designed the part of the van box that hangs over the front cab of the truck to be the location for our customers to place their most fragile items during their move. We call this area Mom\u2019s Attic \u00ae .\nOur distinctive trailers are also manufactured at these same U-Haul \u00ae operated manufacturing and assembly facilities. These trailers are well suited to the low profile of many of today\u2019s newly manufactured automobiles. Our engineering staff is committed to making our trailers easy to tow, safe, aerodynamic and fuel efficient.\nTo provide our self-move customers with added value, our rental trucks and trailers are designed with fuel efficiency in mind. Many of our trucks are fitted with fuel economy gauges, another tool that assists our customers in conserving fuel. To help make our rental equipment more reliable, we routinely perform extensive preventive maintenance and repairs.\nWe also provide customers with equipment to transport their vehicles. We provide two towing options: auto transport, in which all four wheels are off the ground, and a tow dolly, in which the front wheels of the towed vehicle are off the ground.\nTo help our customers load their boxes and larger household appliances and furniture, we offer several accessory rental items. Our utility dolly has a lightweight design and is easy to maneuver. Another rental accessory is our four wheel dolly, which provides a large, flat surface for moving dressers, wall units, pianos and other large household items. U-Haul \u00ae appliance dollies provide the leverage needed to move refrigerators, freezers, washers and dryers easily and safely. These utility, furniture and appliance dollies, along with the low decks and the wide loading ramps on U-Haul \u00ae trucks and trailers, are designed for easy loading and unloading of our customers\u2019 belongings.\nThe total package U-Haul \u00ae offers to the \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d household mover doesn\u2019t end with trucks, trailers and accessory rental items. Our moving supplies include a wide array of affordably priced U-Haul \u00ae brand boxes, tape and packing materials. We also provide specialty boxes for dishes, computers and sensitive electronic equipment, as well as tape, security locks, and packing supplies. U-Haul \u00ae brand boxes are specifically sized to make loading easier.\nWe estimate that U-Haul \u00ae is North America\u2019s largest seller and installer of hitches and towing systems. In addition to towing U-Haul \u00ae equipment, these hitching and towing systems can tow jet skis, motorcycles, boats, campers and horse trailers. Each year, millions of customers visit our locations for expertise on complete towing systems, trailer rentals and the latest in towing accessories.\nU-Haul \u00ae has one of North America\u2019s largest propane refilling networks, with nearly 1,200 locations providing this convenient service. We employ trained, certified personnel to refill propane cylinders and alternative fuel vehicles. Our network of propane dispensing locations is one of the largest automobile alternative refueling networks in North America.\nOur self-storage business was a natural outgrowth of our self-moving operations. Conveniently located U-Haul \u00ae self-storage rental facilities provide clean, dry and secure space for storage of household and commercial goods. Storage units range in size from 6 square feet to over 1,000 square feet. As of March 31, 2020, we operate 1,745 self-storage locations in the United States and Canada, with over 774,000 rentable storage units comprising 66.7 million square feet of rentable storage space. Our self-storage centers feature a wide array of security measures, ranging from electronic property access control gates to individually alarmed storage units. At many centers, we offer climate-controlled storage units to protect temperature sensitive goods such as video tapes, albums, photographs and precious wood furniture.\nAnother extension of our strategy to make \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d moving and storage easier is our U-Box \u00ae program.\nA U-Box \u00ae portable moving and storage unit is delivered to a location of our customer\u2019s choosing either by the customers themselves through the use of a U-Box \u00ae trailer, with the assistance of a Moving Helper or by Company personnel. Once the U-Box \u00ae portable moving and storage unit is filled, it can be stored at the customer\u2019s location, or taken to one of our Company operated locations, a participating independent dealer, or moved to a location of the customer\u2019s choice.\nAdditionally, we offer moving and storage protection packages such as Safemove \u00ae and Safetow \u00ae . These programs provide moving and towing customers with a damage waiver, cargo protection and medical and life insurance coverage. Safestor \u00ae provides protection for storage customers from loss on their goods in storage. Safestor Mobile \u00ae provides protection for customers stored belongings when using our U-Box \u00ae portable moving and storage units. For our customers who desire additional coverage over and above the standard Safemove \u00ae protection, we also offer our Safemove Plus \u00ae product. This package provides the rental customer with a layer of primary liability protection.\nWe believe that through our website, uhaul.com, we have aggregated the largest network of customers and independent businesses in the self-moving and self-storage industry. In particular, our Moving Helper program connects \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d movers with thousands of independent service providers in the United States and Canada to assist our customers in packing, loading, unloading, cleaning and performing other services.\nThrough the U-Haul Storage Affiliates \u00ae program, independent storage businesses can join one of the world\u2019s largest self-storage reservation systems. Self-storage customers making a reservation through uhaul.com \u00ae can access all of the U-Haul self-storage centers and all of our independent storage affiliate partners for even greater convenience to meet their self-storage needs. For the independent storage operator, our network gives them access to products and services allowing them to compete with larger operators more cost effectively.\nWe own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of our Company and its products and services. Certain of these marks are integral to the conduct of our business, a loss of any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business. We consider the trademark \u201cU-Haul \u00ae \u201d to be of material importance to our business in addition, but not limited to, the U.S. trademarks and service marks \u201cAMERCO \u00ae \u201d, \u201ceMove \u00ae \u201d, \u201cGentle Ride Suspension SM \u201d, \u201cIn-Town \u00ae \u201d, \u201cLowest Decks SM \u201d, \u201cMoving made Easier \u00ae \u201d, \u201cMake Moving Easier \u00ae \u201d, \u201cMom\u2019s Attic \u00ae \u201d, \u201cMoving Help \u00ae \u201d, \u201cMoving Helper \u00ae \u201d, \u201cSafemove \u00ae \u201d, \u201cSafemove Plus \u00ae \u201d, \u201cSafestor \u00ae \u201d, \u201cSafestor Mobile \u00ae \u201d, \u201cSafetow \u00ae \u201d,\n\u201cU-Box \u00ae \u201d, \u201cuhaul.com \u00ae \u201d, \u201cU-Haul Investors Club \u00ae \u201d, \u201cU-Haul Truck Share \u00ae \u201d, \u201cU-Haul Truck Share 24/7 \u00ae \u201c \u201cU-Note \u00ae \u201d, \u201cWebSelfStorage \u00ae \u201d, and \u201cU-Haul Smart Mobility Center \u00ae\u201d , among others, for use in connection with the moving and storage business.\nDescription of Operating Segments\nAMERCO\u2019s three reportable segments are:\nMoving and Storage, comprised of AMERCO \u00ae , U-Haul \u00ae , and Amerco Real Estate Company\n(\u201cReal Estate\u201d), and the subsidiaries of U-Haul \u00ae and Real Estate,\nProperty and Casualty Insurance, comprised of Repwest and its subsidiaries and ARCOA, and\nLife Insurance, comprised of Oxford and its subsidiaries.\nFinancial information for each of our operating segments is included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as part of Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMoving and Storage Operating Segment\nMoving and Storage operating segment (\u201cMoving and Storage\u201d) consists of the rental of trucks, trailers, portable moving and storage units, specialty rental items and self-storage spaces primarily to the household mover as well as sales of moving supplies, towing accessories and propane. Operations are conducted under the registered trade name U-Haul \u00ae throughout the United States and Canada.\nNet revenue from Moving and Storage was approximately 91.8%, 94.0% and 91.3% of consolidated net revenue in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe total number of rental trucks in the fleet increased during fiscal 2020 as the pace of new additions was greater than those trucks removed for retirement and sale. These additions and replacements to the fleet were a combination of U-Haul \u00ae manufactured vehicles and purchases. As new trucks are added to the fleet, we typically remove older trucks from the fleet.\nWithin our truck and trailer rental operation, we are focused on expanding our independent dealer network to provide added convenience for our customers. U-Haul \u00ae maximizes vehicle utilization by managing distribution of the truck and trailer fleets among the 2,065 Company-operated stores and over 20,100 independent dealers. Utilizing its proprietary reservations management system, our centers and dealers electronically report their inventory in real-time, which facilitates matching equipment to customer demand. Over half of all U-Move \u00ae rental revenue originated from our operated centers.\nAt our owned and operated retail stores we are implementing new initiatives to improve customer service. These initiatives include improving management of our rental equipment to provide our retail centers with the right type of rental equipment, at the right time and at the most convenient location for our customers, effectively marketing our broad line of self-moving related products and services, expanding accessibility to provide more convenience to our customers, and enhancing our ability to properly staff locations during our peak hours of operations by attracting and retaining \u201cmoonlighters\u201d (part-time U-Haul \u00ae employees with full-time jobs elsewhere) during our peak hours of operation. As of April 2017, U-Haul expanded it\u2019s offering of U-Haul Truck Share 24/7 \u00ae to our entire network in the United States and Canada. U-Haul currently has several U.S. Patents pending on its U-Haul Truck Share 24/7 \u00ae system.\nOur self-moving related products and services, such as boxes, pads and insurance, help our customers have a better moving experience and help them to protect their belongings from potential damage during the moving process. We are committed to providing a complete line of products selected with the \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d moving and storage customer in mind.\nOur self-storage business operations consist of the rental of\nself-storage units, portable moving and storage units, sales of self-storage related products, the facilitation of sales of services, and the management of self-storage facilities owned by others.\nU-Haul \u00ae\nis one of the largest North American operators of self-storage and has been a leader in the self-storage industry since 1974. U-Haul \u00ae\noperates nearly 774,000 rentable storage units, comprising 66.7 million square feet of rentable storage space with locations in 50 states and 10 Canadian provinces. Our owned and managed self-storage facility locations range in size up to 309,000 square feet of storage space, with individual storage units in sizes ranging from 6 square feet to over 1,000 square feet.\nThe primary market for storage units is the storage of household goods. We believe that our self-storage services provide a competitive advantage through such things as Max Security, an electronic system that monitors the storage facility 24 hours a day, climate control in select units, individually alarmed units, extended hours access, and an internet-based customer reservation and account management system.\nMoving Help \u00ae and U-Haul Storage Affiliates \u00ae on uhaul.com are online marketplaces that connect consumers to independent Moving Help \u00ae service providers and thousands of independent Self-Storage Affiliates. Our network of customer-rated Moving Help \u00ae and affiliates provide pack and load help, cleaning help, self-storage and similar services all over the United States and Canada. Our goal is to further utilize our web-based technology platform to increase service to consumers and businesses in the moving and storage market.\nCompliance with environmental requirements of federal, state and local governments significantly affects our business. Our truck and trailer rental business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governmental entities. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state, federal and Canadian agencies exercise broad powers over our motor carrier operations, safety, and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste materials. In addition, our storage business is also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future.\nMoving and Storage business is seasonal and our results of operations and cash flows fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Historically, revenues have been stronger in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the overall increase in moving activity during the spring and summer months. The fourth fiscal quarter is generally our weakest.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Operating Segment\nOur Property and Casualty Insurance operating segment (\u201cProperty and Casualty Insurance\u201d) provides loss adjusting and claims handling for U-Haul through regional offices across the United States and Canada. Property and Casualty Insurance also underwrites components of the Safemove \u00ae , Safetow \u00ae , Safemove Plus \u00ae , Safestore Mobile \u00ae and Safestor \u00ae protection packages to U-Haul customers. We attempt to price our products to be a good value to our customers. The business plan for Property and Casualty Insurance includes offering property and casualty products in other U-Haul related programs.\nNet revenue from Property and Casualty Insurance was approximately 2.2%, 1.9% and 2.0% of consolidated net revenue in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLife Insurance Operating Segment\nLife Insurance provides life and health insurance products primarily to the senior market through the direct writing and reinsuring of life insurance, Medicare supplement and annuity policies.\nNet revenue from Life Insurance was approximately 6.0%, 4.1% and 6.7% of consolidated net revenue in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nEmployees\nAs of March 31, 2020, we employed approximately 30,000 people throughout the United States and Canada with approximately 99% of these employees working within Moving and Storage and approximately 52% of these employees working on a part-time basis.\nSales and Marketing\nWe promote U-Haul \u00ae brand awareness through direct and co-marketing arrangements. Our direct marketing activities consist of web-based initiatives, print and social media as well as trade events, movie and television cameos of our rental fleet and boxes, television commercials, and industry and consumer communications. We believe that our rental equipment is our best form of advertisement. We support our independent U-Haul \u00ae dealers through marketing U-Haul \u00ae moving and self-storage rentals, products and services.\nOur marketing plan focuses on maintaining our leadership position in the \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d moving and storage industry by continually improving the ease of use and economy of our rental equipment, by providing added convenience to our retail centers, through independent U-Haul dealers, and by expanding the capabilities of our U-Haul websites.\nA significant driver of rental transaction volume is our utilization of an online reservation and sales system, through uhaul.com and our 24-hour 1-800-GO-U-HAUL telephone reservations system. These points of contact are prominently featured and are a major driver of customer lead sources.\nCompetition\nMoving and Storage Operating Segment\nThe truck rental industry is highly competitive and includes a number of significant national, regional and local competitors. Generally speaking, we consider there to be two distinct users of rental trucks: commercial and \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d residential users. We primarily focus on the \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d residential user. Within this segment, we believe the principal competitive factors are convenience of rental locations, availability of quality rental moving equipment, breadth of essential products and services, and total cost to the user. Our major national competitors in both the in-town and one-way moving equipment rental market include Avis Budget Group, Inc. and Penske Truck Leasing. We have numerous competitors throughout the United States and Canada who compete with us in the in-town market.\nThe self-storage market is large and very fragmented. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of storage rental locations, cleanliness, security and price. Our largest competitors in the self-storage market are Public Storage Inc., Extra Space Storage, Inc., CubeSmart and Life Storage, Inc.\nInsurance Operating Segments\nThe insurance industry is highly competitive. In addition, the marketplace includes financial services firms offering both insurance and financial products. Some of the insurance companies are owned by stockholders and others are owned by policyholders. Many competitors have been in business for a longer period of time or possess substantially greater financial resources and broader product portfolios than our insurance companies. We compete in the insurance business based upon price, product design, and services rendered to agents and policyholders.\nFinancial Data of Segment and Geographic Areas\nFor financial data of our segments and geographic areas please see Note 22, Financial Information by Geographic Area, and Note 22A, Consolidating Financial Information by Consolidating Industry Segment, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cAnnual Report\u201d), contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d regarding future events and our future results of operations.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.\nThese risk factors may be important in understanding this Annual Report or elsewhere.\nThe recent novel coronavirus\n(\u201cCOVID-19\u201d)\nglobal pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFuture viral pandemics could have similar or more severe effects on our business.\nIn late 2019,\nCOVID-19\nwas first detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared\nCOVID-19\na global pandemic, and governmental authorities around the world have implemented measures to reduce the spread of\nCOVID-19.\nThe virus, along with measures have adversely affected workforces, customers, consumer sentiment, economies and financial markets.\nThe combination of customer-initiated changes in behavior along with state and local jurisdictions imposing shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in reduced business activity.\nThese events have highlighted several risks to our business resulting from COVID-19 or other potential future pandemics.\nOur locations are considered essential services and have been open and serving communities throughout the current pandemic. There is a risk this may not always be the case.\nAdditionally, our workforce may be negatively impacted by such a pandemic that could lead to disruptions in our ability to serve customers.\nWe are unable to accurately predict the impact that COVID-19 or other such similar outbreaks will have on our operations going forward due to uncertainties which will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration of COVID-19 and the impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response to the pandemic.\nWhile it is premature to accurately predict the ultimate impact of these developments, we suspect that our results for the quarter ending June 30, 2020 and potentially the remainder of fiscal 2021 may be significantly adversely affected.\nTo the extent COVID-19\nadversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness, our fleet rotation program, the manufacturers and suppliers of our rental equipment, our independent dealers and the operation of our rental fleet, sales of our products and operation of our locations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe truck rental industry is highly competitive and includes a number of significant national, regional and local competitors. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of rental locations, availability of quality rental moving equipment, breadth of essential services and products and total cost. Financial results for the Company can be adversely impacted by aggressive pricing from our competitors. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing rental prices or implement price increases. Moreover, if our competitors reduce prices and we are not able or willing to do so as well, we may lose rental volume, which would likely have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. Numerous potential competitors are working to establish paradigm shifting technologies from self-driving vehicles to ride-hailing services and other technologies that connect riders with vehicles.\nThe self-storage industry is large and highly fragmented. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of storage rental locations, cleanliness, security and price. Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of our facilities. Competition might cause us to experience a decrease in occupancy levels, limit our ability to raise rental rates or require us to offer discounted rates that would have a material effect on results of operations and financial condition. Entry into the self-storage business may be accomplished through the acquisition of existing facilities by persons or institutions with the required initial capital. Development of new self-storage facilities is more difficult however, due to land use, zoning, environmental and other regulatory requirements. The self-storage industry has in the past experienced overbuilding in response to perceived increases in demand. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in existing markets or expand into new markets.\nWe are highly leveraged.\nAs of March 31, 2020, we had total debt outstanding of $4,651.1 million and operating lease liabilities of $106.4 million. Although we believe, based on existing information, that additional leverage can be supported by our operations and revenues, our existing debt could impact us in the following ways among other considerations:\nrequire us to allocate a considerable portion of cash flows from operations to debt service and lease payments;\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing; and\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt.\nOur ability to make payments on our debt and leases depends upon our ability to maintain and improve our operating performance and generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt and meet our other cash needs, including our leases, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness and leases. If we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue. In addition, we may incur additional debt or leases that would exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nUncertainty regarding LIBOR may adversely impact our indebtedness under our credit and loan facilities.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. In addition, in April 2018, the Federal Reserve System, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, announced the replacement of LIBOR with a new index, calculated by short-term repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). At this time, it is not possible to predict whether SOFR will attain market traction as a LIBOR replacement. Additionally, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. Potential changes, or uncertainty related to such potential changes, may adversely affect the market for LIBOR-based securities, including our portfolio of LIBOR-indexed, floating-rate debt securities, or the cost of our borrowings. In addition, changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the market for LIBOR-based securities, including the value of the LIBOR-indexed, floating-rate debt securities in our portfolio, or the cost of our borrowings. Additionally, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our credit and loan facilities extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate and certain of our existing credit facilities to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. The potential effect of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR on our cost of capital and net investment income cannot yet be determined.\nEconomic conditions, including those related to the credit markets, may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nConsumer and commercial spending is generally affected by the health of the economy, which places some of the factors affecting the success of our business beyond our control. Our businesses, although not as traditionally cyclical as some, could experience significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. In times of declining consumer spending we may be driven, along with our competitors, to reduce pricing which would have a negative impact on gross profit.\nWe cannot predict if another downturn in the economy will occur, which could result in reduced revenues and working capital.\nShould credit markets in the United States tighten or if interest rates increase significantly, we may not be able to refinance existing debt or find additional financing on favorable terms, if at all.\nIf one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facilities fails or opts not to continue to lend to us, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under credit facilities.\nIf our operating results were to worsen significantly and our cash flows or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur fleet rotation program can be adversely affected by financial market conditions.\nTo meet the needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment. Our rental truck fleet rotation program is funded internally through operations and externally from debt and lease financing. Our ability to fund our routine fleet rotation program could be adversely affected if financial market conditions limit the general availability of external financing. This could lead us to operate trucks longer than initially planned and/or reduce the size of the fleet, either of which could materially and negatively affect our results of operations.\nAnother important aspect of our fleet rotation program is the sale of used rental equipment. The sale of used equipment provides us with funds that can be used to purchase new equipment. Conditions may arise that could lead to the decrease in demand and/or resale values for our used equipment. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, which could result in substantial losses on the sale of equipment and decreases in cash flows from the sales of equipment.\nWe obtain our rental trucks from a limited number of manufacturers.\nOver the last twenty years, we purchased the majority of our rental trucks from Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. Our fleet can be negatively affected by issues our manufacturers may face within their own supply chain. Also, it is possible that our suppliers may face financial difficulties or organizational changes which could negatively impact their ability to accept future orders or fulfill existing orders. The cost of acquiring new rental trucks could increase materially and negatively affect our ability to rotate new equipment into the fleet. Although we believe that we could contract with alternative manufacturers for our rental trucks, we cannot guarantee or predict how long that would take. In addition, termination of our existing relationship with these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations for an indefinite period of time.\nA substantial amount of our shares is owned by a small contingent of stockholders.\nWillow Grove Holdings LP, directly and through controlled entities (\u201cWGHLP\u201d), owns 8,337,804 shares of AMERCO common stock, and together with Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen, owns 8,390,066 shares (approximately 42.8%) of AMERCO common stock.\nThe general partner of WGHLP controls the voting and disposition decisions with respect to the common stock of AMERCO owned by WGHLP, and is managed by Edward J. Shoen (the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of AMERCO) and his brother, Mark V. Shoen.\nAccordingly,\nEdward J. Shoen\nand\nMark V. Shoen\nare in a position to significantly influence\nour business and policies, including the approval of\ncertain\nsignificant transactions, the election of the members of\nour\nBoard\nof Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d)\nand other matters submitted to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that their\ninterests will not conflict with the interests\nof our other stockholders.\nIn addition, 1,003,040 shares (approximately 5.1%) of AMERCO common stock are owned under our Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\u201cESOP\u201d).\nEach ESOP participant is entitled to vote the shares allocated to himself or herself in their discretion.\nIn the event an ESOP participant does not vote his or her shares, such shares shall be voted by the ESOP trustee, in the ESOP trustee\u2019s discretion.\nOur operations subject us to numerous environmental regulations and the possibility that environmental liability in the future could adversely affect our operations.\nCompliance with environmental requirements of federal, state and local governments significantly affects our business. Among other things, these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances. Under environmental laws or common law principles, we can be held liable for hazardous substances that are found on real property we have owned or operated. We are aware of issues regarding hazardous substances on some of our real estate and we have put in place a remediation plan at each site where we believe such a plan is necessary. See Note 19, Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We regularly make capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance with environmental laws. In particular, we have managed a testing and removal program since 1988 for our underground storage tanks.\nDespite these compliance efforts, the risk of environmental liability is part of the nature of our business.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. We cannot assure you that future compliance with these regulations, future environmental liabilities, the cost of defending environmental claims, conducting any environmental remediation or generally resolving liabilities caused by us or related third parties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nOur truck and trailer rental business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governmental entities. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state, federal and Canadian agencies exercise broad powers over our motor carrier operations, safety, and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste materials. In addition, our storage business is also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to use the property as collateral for future borrowings. Compliance with changing regulations could substantially impair real property and equipment productivity and increase our costs. In addition, the Federal government may institute some regulation that limits carbon emissions by setting a maximum amount of carbon individual entities can emit without penalty. This would likely affect everyone who uses fossil fuels and would disproportionately affect users in the highway transportation industries. While there are too many variables at this time to assess the impact of the various proposed federal and state regulations that could affect carbon emissions, many experts believe these proposed rules could significantly affect the way companies operate in their businesses.\nOur operations can be limited by land-use regulations. Zoning choices enacted by individual municipalities in the United States and Canada may limit our ability to serve certain markets with our products and services.\nOur insurance companies are heavily regulated by state insurance departments and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d). These insurance regulations are primarily in place to protect the interests of our policyholders and not our investors. Changes in these laws and regulations could increase our costs, inhibit new sales, or limit our ability to implement rate increases.\nA significant portion of our revenues are generated through third-parties.\nOur business plan relies upon a network of independent dealers strategically located throughout the United States and Canada.\nAs of March 31, 2020 we had over 20,100 independent equipment rental dealers.\nIn fiscal 2020, less than half of all U-Move \u00ae rental revenue originated through this network.\nOur inability to maintain this network or its current cost structure could inhibit our ability to adequately serve our customers and may negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe face liability risks associated with the operation of our rental fleet, sales of our products and operation of our locations.\nThe business of renting moving and storage equipment to customers exposes us to liability claims including property damage, personal injury and even death. Likewise, the operation of our moving and storage centers along with the sale of our related moving supplies, towing accessories and installation, and refilling of propane tanks may subject us to liability claims.\nWe seek to limit the occurrence of such events through the design of our equipment, communication of its proper use, exhaustive repair and maintenance schedules, extensive training of our personnel, proactive risk management assessments and by providing our customers with online resources for the proper use of products and services.\nRegardless, accidents still occur and we manage the financial risk of these events through third party insurance carriers. While these excess loss and property insurance policies are available today at reasonable costs, this could change and could negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.\nTerrorist attacks could negatively impact our operations and profitability and may expose us to liability and reputational damage.\nTerrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and profitability.\nSuch attacks may damage our facilities and it is also possible that our rental equipment could be involved in a terrorist attack.\nAlthough we carry excess of loss insurance coverage, it may prove to be insufficient to cover us for acts of terror using our rental equipment.\nMoreover, we may suffer reputational damage that could arise from a terrorist attack which utilizes our rental equipment. The consequences of any terrorist attacks or hostilities are unpredictable and difficult to quantify.\nWe seek to minimize these risks through our operational processes and procedures; however, we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are highly dependent upon our automated systems and the Internet for managing our business.\nOur information systems are largely Internet-based, including our point-of-sale reservation system, payment processing and telephone systems.\nWhile our reliance on this technology lowers our cost of providing service and expands our abilities to better serve customers, it exposes us to various risks including natural and man-made disasters, terrorist attacks and cyber-attacks.\nWe have put into place extensive security protocols, backup systems and alternative procedures to mitigate these risks.\nHowever, disruptions or breaches, detected or undetected by us, for any period of time in any portion of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and inflict reputational damage.\nIn addition, the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, malicious insiders, or catastrophic events. Hackers, acting individually or in coordinated groups, may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or ransom or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages or other interruptions in our business and access to our data.\nIn addition, breaches in security could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected, to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nAny of these occurrences could result in disruptions in our operations, the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our brand and reputation, and litigation and potential liability for the Company. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant and our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate any security breaches may not be successful.\nA.M. Best financial strength ratings are crucial to our life insurance business.\nIn June 2019, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength rating for Oxford and Christian Fidelity Life Insurance Company (\u201cCFLIC\u201d) of A- and revised the outlook from stable to positive and affirmed the financial strength rating for North American Insurance Company (\u201cNAI\u201d) of B++ with a stable outlook. Financial strength ratings are important external factors that can affect the success of Oxford\u2019s business plans. Accordingly, if Oxford\u2019s ratings, relative to its competitors, are not maintained or do not continue to improve, Oxford may not be able to retain and attract business as currently planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur losses due to our reinsurers\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 failure to perform under existing contracts or we may be unable to secure sufficient reinsurance or hedging protection in the future.\nWe use reinsurance and derivative contracts to mitigate our risk of loss in various circumstances; primarily at Repwest and for Moving and Storage. These agreements do not release us from our primary obligations and therefore we remain ultimately responsible for these potential costs. We cannot provide assurance that these reinsurers or counterparties will fulfill their obligations. Their inability or unwillingness to make payments to us under the terms of the contracts may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2019, Repwest reported $0.6 million of reinsurance recoverables, net of allowances and $87.1 million of reserves and liabilities ceded to reinsurers. Of this, Repwest\u2019s largest exposure to a single reinsurer was $54.5 million.\nRecent changes to U.S. tax laws may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations and create the risk that we may need to adjust our accounting for these changes.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Reform Act\u201d) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) made significant changes to U.S. tax laws and includes numerous provisions that affect businesses, including ours.\nFor instance, as a result of lower corporate tax rates, the Tax Reform Act tends to reduce both the value of deferred tax assets and the amount of deferred tax liabilities.\nIt also limits interest expense deductions and the amount of net operating losses that can be used each year and alters the expensing of capital expenditures. Other provisions have international tax consequences for businesses like ours that operate internationally. The CARES Act allows for the carryback of certain net operating losses. The Tax Reform Act is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the IRS, as well as state tax authorities, and the Tax Reform Act and CARES Act could be subject to amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase the adverse (and positive) impacts of these acts. The accounting treatment of these tax law changes was complex, and some of the changes affected both current and future periods.\nOthers primarily affected future periods.\nAs discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, our analysis and computations of the tax effects of the Tax Reform Act on us was complete as of December 22, 2018.",

    "item_7": "Item 7.Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe begin this MD&A with the overall strategy of AMERCO, followed by a description of, and strategy related to, our operating segments to give the reader an overview of the goals of our businesses and the direction in which our businesses and products are moving. We then discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. Next, we discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019, and for fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, which are followed by an analysis of liquidity changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and a discussion of our financial commitments in the sections entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources and Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. We conclude this MD&A by discussing our outlook for fiscal 2021.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report, including Item 1: Business, Item 6: Selected Financial Data and Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The various sections of this MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements, as discussed under the caption, Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this Annual Report and particularly under the section Item 1A: Risk Factors. Our actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\nAMERCO has a fiscal year that ends on the 31 st of March for each year that is referenced. Our insurance company subsidiaries have fiscal years that end on the 31 st of December for each year that is referenced. They have been consolidated on that basis. Our insurance companies\u2019 financial reporting processes conform to calendar year reporting as required by state insurance departments. Management believes that consolidating their calendar year into our fiscal year financial statements does not materially affect the presentation of financial position or results of operations. We disclose all material events, if any, occurring during the intervening period. Consequently, all references to our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 years 2019, 2018 and 2017 correspond to fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 for AMERCO.\nOverall Strategy\nOur overall strategy is to maintain our leadership position in the North American \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d moving and storage industry. We accomplish this by providing a seamless and integrated supply chain to the \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d moving and storage market. As part of executing this strategy, we leverage the brand recognition of U-Haul\nwith our full line of moving and self-storage related products and services and the convenience of our broad geographic presence.\nOur primary focus is to provide our customers with a wide selection of moving rental equipment, convenient self-storage rental facilities and portable moving and storage units and related moving and self-storage products and services. We are able to expand our distribution and improve customer service by increasing the amount of moving equipment and storage units and portable moving and storage units available for rent, expanding the number of independent dealers in our network and expanding and taking advantage of our eMove capabilities.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance is focused on providing and administering property and casualty insurance to U-Haul and its customers, its independent dealers and affiliates.\nLife Insurance is focused on long-term capital growth through direct writing and reinsuring of life, Medicare supplement and annuity products in the senior marketplace.\nDescription of Operating Segments\nAMERCO\u2019s three reportable segments are:\nMoving and Storage, comprised of AMERCO, U-Haul, and Real Estate and the subsidiaries of\nU-Haul and Real Estate;\nProperty and Casualty Insurance, comprised of Repwest and its subsidiaries and ARCOA; and\nLife Insurance, comprised of Oxford and its subsidiaries.\nSee Note 1, Basis of Presentation, Note 22, Financial Information by Geographic Area, and Note 22A, Consolidating Financial Information by Industry Segment, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report.\nMoving and Storage Operating Segment\nMoving and Storage consists of the rental of trucks, trailers, portable moving and storage units, specialty rental items and self-storage spaces primarily to the household mover as well as sales of moving supplies, towing accessories and propane.

The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. Note 3, Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report summarizes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Certain accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments and assumptions, often as a result of the need to estimate matters that are inherently uncertain.\nFollowing is a detailed description of the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us and that require management\u2019s most difficult and subjective judgments. These estimates are based on historical experience, observance of trends in particular areas, information and valuations available from outside sources and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions, and such differences may be material.\nWe also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as revenue recognition; however, these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates, because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. The accounting policies that we deem most critical to us, and involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments include the following:\nRecoverability of Property, Plant and Equipment\nOur property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Interest expense, if any, incurred during the initial construction of buildings is considered part of cost. Depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line or an accelerated method based on a declining balance formula over the following estimated useful lives: rental equipment 2-20 years and buildings and non-rental equipment 3-55 years. Routine maintenance costs are charged to operating expense as they are incurred. Gains and losses on dispositions of property, plant and equipment, other than real estate (\u201cpersonal property\u201d), are netted against depreciation expense when realized. Equipment depreciation is recognized in amounts expected to result in the recovery of estimated residual values upon disposal, i.e., minimize gains or losses. In determining the depreciation rate, historical disposal experience, holding periods and trends in the market for vehicles are reviewed. As a result of changes in IRS regulations regarding the capitalization of assets, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we raised the value threshold before certain assets are capitalized within our depreciation policy. This change in threshold, results in the immediate recognition of reported operating costs with a lagging decrease in depreciation expense over the term that these assets would have been depreciated. This change in threshold benefited us through the immediate recognition of tax deductible costs.\nWe regularly perform reviews to determine whether facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the carrying amount of assets, including estimates of residual value, may not be recoverable or that the useful life of assets are shorter or longer than originally estimated. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the remaining life of the equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks and trailers. We assess the recoverability of our assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles and the expected life of vehicles included in the fleet. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If asset residual values are determined to be recoverable, but the useful lives are shorter or longer than originally estimated, the net book value of the assets is depreciated over the newly determined remaining useful lives.\nFor our box truck fleet we utilize an accelerated method of depreciation based upon a declining formula. Under the declining balances method (2.4 times declining balance), the book value of a rental truck is reduced by approximately 16%, 13%, 11%, 9%, 8%, 7%, and 6% of cost during years one through seven, respectively, and then reduced on a straight line basis to a salvage value of 15% by the end of year fifteen. Comparatively, a standard straight line approach would reduce the book value by approximately 5.7% per year over the life of the truck.\nAlthough we intend to sell our used vehicles for prices approximating book value, the extent to which we realize a gain or loss on the sale of used vehicles is dependent upon various factors including but not limited to, the general state of the used vehicle market, the age and condition of the vehicle at the time of its disposal and the depreciation rates with respect to the vehicle . We typically sell our used vehicles at our sales centers throughout the United States and Canada, on our website at uhaul.com/trucksales or by phone at 1-866-404-0355. Additionally, we sell a large portion of our pickup and cargo van fleet at automobile dealer auctions.\nInsurance Reserves\nLiabilities for future policy benefits related to life insurance, Medical supplement insurance, and deferred annuities are determined by Management utilizing the net premium valuation methodology and are accrued when premium revenue is recognized. The liability, which represents the present value of future benefits to be paid to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums, is estimated using assumptions applicable at the time the insurance contracts are written, with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as appropriate. Assumptions include expected mortality and morbidity experience, policy lapses and surrenders, current asset yields and expenses, and expected interest rate yields. The Company periodically performs a gross premium valuation and reviews original assumptions, including capitalized expenses which reduce the gross premium valuation, to evaluate whether the assets and liabilities are adequate and whether a loss reserve should be recognized.\nInsurance reserves for Property and Casualty Insurance and U-Haul take into account losses incurred based upon actuarial estimates and are management\u2019s best approximation of future payments.\nThese estimates are based upon past claims experience and current claim trends as well as social and economic conditions such as changes in legal theories and inflation.\nThese reserves consist of case reserves for reported losses and a provision for IBNR losses, both reduced by applicable reinsurance recoverables, resulting in a net liability.\nDue to the nature of the underlying risks and high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of the liability for future policy benefits and claims, the amounts to be ultimately paid to settle these liabilities cannot be precisely determined and may vary significantly from the estimated liability, especially for long-tailed casualty lines of business such as excess workers\u2019 compensation.\nAs a result of the long-tailed nature of the excess workers\u2019 compensation policies written by Repwest from 1983 through 2001, it may take a number of years for claims to be fully reported and finally settled.\nOn a regular basis insurance reserve adequacy is reviewed by management to determine if existing assumptions need to be updated. In determining the assumptions for calculating workers\u2019 compensation reserves, management considers multiple factors including the following:\nClaimant longevity,\nCost trends associated with claimant treatments,\nChanges in ceding entity and third party administrator reporting practices,\nChanges in environmental factors including legal and regulatory,\nCurrent conditions affecting claim settlements, and\nFuture economic conditions including inflation.\nWe have reserved each claim based upon the accumulation of current claim costs projected through each claimant\u2019s life expectancy, and then adjusted for applicable reinsurance arrangements.\nManagement reviews each claim bi-annually or more frequently, if there are changes in facts or circumstances to determine if the estimated life-time claim costs have increased and then adjusts the reserve estimate accordingly at that time.\nWe have factored in an estimate of what the potential cost increases could be in our IBNR liability.\nWe have not assumed settlement of the existing claims in calculating the reserve amount, unless it is in the final stages of completion.\nContinued increases in claim costs, including medical inflation and new treatments and medications could lead to future adverse development resulting in additional reserve strengthening.\nConversely, settlement of existing claims or if injured workers return to work or expire prematurely, could lead to future positive development.\nImpairment of Investments\nInvestments are evaluated pursuant to guidance contained in ASC 320 - Investments - Debt and Equity Securities to determine if and when a decline in market value of debt securities below amortized cost is other-than-temporary. Management makes certain assumptions or judgments in its assessment including but not limited to: our ability and intent to hold the security, quoted market prices, dealer quotes or discounted cash flows, industry factors, financial factors, and issuer specific information such as credit strength. Other-than-temporary impairment in value is recognized in the current period operating results. There were no write downs in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nWe file a consolidated tax return with all of our legal subsidiaries.\nOur tax returns are periodically reviewed by various taxing authorities. The final outcome of these audits may cause changes that could materially impact our financial results. Please see Note 14, Provision for Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report for more information.\nFair Values\nFair values of cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to the short period of time to maturity. Fair values of short-term investments, investments available-for-sale, long-term investments, mortgage loans and notes on real estate, and interest rate swap contracts are based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. Fair values of trade receivables approximate their recorded value.\nOur financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments, trade receivables, reinsurance recoverables and notes receivable. Limited credit risk exists on trade receivables due to the diversity of our customer base and their dispersion across broad geographic markets. We place our temporary cash investments with financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.\nWe have mortgage receivables, which potentially expose us to credit risk. The portfolio of notes is principally collateralized by self-storage facilities and commercial properties. We have not experienced any material losses related to the notes from individual or groups of notes in any particular industry or geographic area. The estimated fair values were determined using the discounted cash flow method and using interest rates currently offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings.\nThe carrying amount of long-term debt and short-term borrowings are estimated to approximate fair value as the actual interest rate is consistent with the rate estimated to be currently available for debt of similar term and remaining maturity.\nOther investments including short-term investments are substantially current or bear reasonable interest rates. As a result, the carrying values of these financial instruments approximate fair value.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease see Note 3, Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report for more information.\nAMERCO and Consolidated Subsidiaries\nFiscal 2020 Compared with Fiscal 2019\nListed below, on a consolidated basis, are revenues for our major product lines for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019:\nYear Ended March 31,\n(In thousands)\nSelf-moving equipment rentals\n$\n2,692,413\n$\n2,653,497\nSelf-storage revenues\n418,741\n367,276\nSelf-moving and self-storage products and service sales\n265,091\n264,146\nProperty management fees\n30,406\n29,148\nLife insurance premiums\n127,976\n63,488\nProperty and casualty insurance premiums\n66,053\n60,853\nNet investment and interest income\n137,829\n110,934\nOther revenue\n240,359\n219,365\nConsolidated revenue\n$\n3,978,868\n$\n3,768,707\nSelf-moving equipment rental revenues increased $38.9 million during fiscal 2020, compared with fiscal 2019.\nRevenue for both our In-town and one-way markets improved for trucks and trailers.\nPartially offsetting the improvement was a reduction in the volume of Corporate Account rentals in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020, along with the decline in overall rental activity in the second half of March 2020 due to the COVID-19 related stay-at-home orders.\nWe increased the number of retail locations, trucks and trailers in the rental fleet compared to the same period last year.\nSelf-storage revenues increased $51.5 million during fiscal 2020, compared with fiscal 2019.\nThe average monthly number of occupied units increased by 16%, or 45,000 units during fiscal 2020 compared with the same period last year.\nThe growth in revenues and units rented comes from a combination of occupancy gains at existing locations and from the addition of new facilities to the portfolio. During fiscal 2020, we added approximately 5.8 million net rentable square feet, a 16% increase, with approximately 1.2 million of that occurring during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nLife insurance premiums increased $64.5 million during fiscal 2020, compared with fiscal 2019 primarily due to a reinsurance agreement termination in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, reducing prior year premiums by $76.0 million.\nProperty and casualty insurance premiums increased $5.2 million during fiscal 2020, compared with fiscal 2019. A significant portion of Repwest\u2019s premiums are from policies sold in conjunction with U-Haul rental transactions. The premium increase corresponded with the increased moving and storage transactions at U-Haul during the same period.\nNet investment and interest income increased $26.9 million during fiscal 2020, compared with fiscal 2019 due to a larger invested asset base and realized gains on derivatives at our life insurance subsidiary.\nAdditionally, recognizing the changes in market value of unaffiliated common stocks at our insurance subsidiary accounted for $9.5 million of the increase.\nOther revenue increased $21.0 million during fiscal 2020, compared with fiscal 2019, caused primarily by growth in our U-Box \u00ae program.\nListed below are revenues and earnings from operations at each of our operating segments for fiscal and 2019.

Our insurance segments\u2019 total costs and expenses increased $83.6 million; this was largely due to a one-time decrease of $76.4 million in life benefits in fiscal 2019 because Oxford agreed to terminate a reinsurance contract with one of our reinsurers (\u201cReinsurance contract termination\u201d).\nOperating expenses for Moving and Storage increased $131.3 million.\nThe largest contributors to this were personnel, liability costs, utilities, property maintenance projects, property taxes and freight expense. Repair costs associated with the rental fleet increased $19.5 million primarily due to an increase in the number of rental trucks and trailers.\nDepreciation expense associated with our rental fleet increased $55.1 million to $510.5 million due to the larger fleet.\nDepreciation expense on all other assets, mostly buildings and improvements, increased $28.0 million to $153.6 million. Gains on the disposal of real estate increased $0.7 million due to the condemnation of a property in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nAs a result of the above-mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, earnings from operations decreased to $540.1 million for fiscal 2020, compared with $621.0 million for fiscal 2019.\nInterest expense for fiscal 2020 was $161.0 million, compared with $142.4 million for fiscal 2019 due to an increase in borrowings in fiscal 2020.\nIncome tax benefit (expense) was $63.9 million for fiscal 2020, compared with ($106.7) million for fiscal 2019 due to the effect of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) as enacted on March 27, 2020. Our effective tax rate was (16.9%) of net income before taxes for fiscal 2020, compared with 22.3% in the prior year period. Federal net operating losses from fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020 have been carried back to prior tax years as provided by the CARES Act. The statutory tax rate for the carryback years was 35% as compared with 21% at present. Consequently, we recognized a benefit amount of $146.0 million in fiscal 2020. Excluding the CARES Act benefit mentioned above, our effective tax rate for all of fiscal 2020, post CARES Act, was 21.7% compared with 22.3% for fiscal 2019. See Note 14, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report for more information on income taxes.\nAs a result of the above-mentioned items, earnings available to common shareholders were $442.0 million for fiscal 2020, compared with $370.9 million for fiscal 2019.\nBasic and diluted earnings per common share for fiscal 2020 were $22.55, compared with $18.93 for fiscal 2019.\nThe weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted were 19,603,708 for fiscal 2020, compared with 19,592,048 for fiscal 2019.\nAMERCO and Consolidated Subsidiaries\nFiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018\nListed below, on a consolidated basis, are revenues for our major product lines for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018:\nYear Ended March 31,\n(In thousands)\nSelf-moving equipment rentals\n$\n2,653,497\n$\n2,479,742\nSelf-storage revenues\n367,276\n323,903\nSelf-moving and self-storage products and service sales\n264,146\n261,557\nProperty management fees\n29,148\n29,602\nLife insurance premiums\n63,488\n154,703\nProperty and casualty insurance premiums\n60,853\n57,100\nNet investment and interest income\n110,934\n110,473\nOther revenue\n219,365\n184,034\nConsolidated revenue\n$\n3,768,707\n$\n3,601,114\nSelf-moving equipment rental revenues increased $173.8 million during fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018.

Our effective tax rate was 22.3% of net income before taxes for fiscal 2019, compared to (24.0%) in the prior-year period. The decrease in our deferred tax liability in fiscal 2018 resulting from the application of the new federal income tax rate accounted for a $371.5 million decrease, partially offset by a $10.7 million one-time increase resulting from the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and a $4.2 million one-time increase resulting from Phase Three tax on our Life Insurance subsidiary. Excluding the one-time benefits and charges mentioned above, our effective tax rate for all of fiscal 2018, post Tax Reform Act, was 31.8%.

During fiscal 2020, we added approximately 5.8 million net rentable square feet, a 16% increase, with approximately 1.2 million of that occurring during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nThe Company owns and manages self-storage facilities. Self-storage revenues reported in the consolidated financial statements represent Company-owned locations only. Self-storage data for our owned storage locations follows:\nYear Ended March 31,\n(In thousands, except occupancy rate)\nUnit count as of March 31\nSquare footage as of March 31\n42,082\n36,237\nAverage monthly number of units occupied\nAverage monthly occupancy rate based on unit count\n67.7%\n68.7%\nAverage monthly square footage occupied\n28,946\n24,862\nDuring fiscal 2020, we added approximately 5.8 million net rentable square feet of new storage to the system. This was a mix of existing storage locations we acquired and new development. On average, the occupancy rate of this new capacity on the date it was added was 2%.\nNet investment and interest income decreased $3.3 million during fiscal 2020, compared with fiscal 2019 due to decreased invested cash balances and lower yields.\nOther revenue increased $21.4 million during fiscal 2020, compared with fiscal 2019, caused primarily by growth in our U-Box \u00ae program.\nTotal costs and expenses increased $209.2 million during fiscal 2020, compared with fiscal 2019. Operating expenses for Moving and Storage increased $131.3 million.\nThe largest contributors to this were personnel, liability costs, utilities, property maintenance projects, property taxes and freight expense. Repair costs associated with the rental fleet increased $19.5 million primarily due to an increase in the number of rental trucks and trailers.\nDepreciation expense associated with our rental fleet increased $55.1 million to $510.5 million due to the larger fleet.\nDepreciation expense on all other assets, mostly buildings and improvements, increased $28.0 million to $153.6 million. Gains on the disposal of real estate increased $0.7 million due to the condemnation of a property in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nAs a result of the above-mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, earnings from operations for Moving and Storage before consolidation of the equity in the earnings of the insurance subsidiaries decreased to $472.0 million for fiscal 2020 as compared with $569.2 million for fiscal 2019.\nEquity in the earnings of AMERCO\u2019s insurance subsidiaries increased $14.0 million for fiscal 2020, compared with fiscal 2019.\nAs a result of the above-mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, earnings from operations decreased to $527.8 million for fiscal 2020, compared with $611.1 million for fiscal 2019.\nMoving and Storage\nFiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018\nListed below are revenues for the major product lines at Moving and Storage for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018:\nYear Ended March 31,\n(In thousands)\nSelf-moving equipment rentals\n$\n2,656,327\n$\n2,483,956\nSelf-storage revenues\n367,276\n323,903\nSelf-moving and self-storage products and service sales\n264,146\n261,557\nProperty management fees\n29,148\n29,602\nNet investment and interest income\n13,857\n12,232\nOther revenue\n215,055\n179,417\nMoving and Storage revenue\n$\n3,545,809\n$\n3,290,667\nSelf-moving equipment rental revenues increased $172.4 million during fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019 we expanded the number of Company-owned locations along with independent dealers, and increased the number of trucks, trailers and towing devices in our rental fleet.\nIn the third and fourth quarters we saw revenue improvements in our corporate account business.\nRevenue and transactions for both the One-way and in-town markets improved compared to fiscal 2018.\nSelf-storage revenues increased $43.4 million during fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018.\nThe average monthly amount of occupied square feet increased by 12.0% during fiscal 2019 compared with the same period in fiscal 2018.\nThe growth in revenues and square feet rented comes from a combination of improved rates per square foot, occupancy gains at existing locations and from the addition of new facilities to the portfolio. During fiscal 2019, we added approximately 5.3 million net rentable square feet, a 17.0% increase, with approximately 1.5 million of that coming on during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\nThe Company owns and manages self-storage facilities. Self-storage revenues reported in the consolidated financial statements represent Company-owned locations only. Self-storage data for our owned storage locations follows:\nYear Ended March 31,\n(In thousands, except occupancy rate)\nUnit count as of March 31\nSquare footage as of March 31\n36,237\n30,974\nAverage monthly number of units occupied\nAverage monthly occupancy rate based on unit count\n68.7%\n71.6%\nAverage monthly square footage occupied\n24,862\n22,203\nDuring fiscal 2019, we added approximately 5.3 million net rentable square feet of new storage to the system. This was a mix of existing storage locations we acquired and new development. On average, the occupancy rate of this new capacity on the date it was added was 9.5%.\nSales of self-moving and self-storage products and services increased $2.6 million during fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018 primarily from the sales of moving supplies and propane.\nOther revenue increased $35.6 million during fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018, caused primarily by growth in our U-Box \u00ae program.\nTotal costs and expenses increased $203.2 million during fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018, excluding changes to net (gains) losses on disposal of real estate. Operating expenses for Moving and Storage increased $179.6 million, largely from increased personnel, maintenance repairs, shipping costs associated with U-Box \u00ae , building maintenance and property taxes. Repair costs accounted for $45.6 million of the increase. Net gains from the disposal of rental equipment increased $15.1 million.\nCompared with fiscal 2018, we sold more used trucks and the average sales proceeds per truck improved.\nDepreciation expense associated with our rental fleet increased $11.6 million due to a larger fleet.\nDepreciation expense on all other assets, largely from buildings and improvements increased $14.4 million.\nNet gains on disposal of real estate decreased $195.4 million.\nThe decrease was caused by the sale of a portion of our Chelsea, New York property in October 2017 which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $190.7 million in fiscal 2018.\nAs a result of the above-mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, earnings from operations for Moving and Storage before consolidation of the equity in the earnings of the insurance subsidiaries decreased to $569.2 million for fiscal 2019 as compared with $712.7 million for fiscal 2018.\nEquity in the earnings of AMERCO\u2019s insurance subsidiaries decreased $5.2 million for fiscal 2019, compared with fiscal 2018.\nAs a result of the above-mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, earnings from operations decreased to $611.1 million for fiscal 2019, compared with $759.7 million for fiscal 2018.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance\n2019 Compared with 2018\nNet premiums were $69.1 million and $63.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A significant portion of Repwest\u2019s premiums are from policies sold in conjunction with U-Haul rental transactions. The premium growth corresponded with the increased moving and storage transactions at U-Haul.\nNet investment and interest income were $19.9 million and $12.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in equity valuations of $9.5 million were offset by a decrease in realized investment gains of $2.6 million.\nNet operating expenses were $33.8 million and $34.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change was due to an increase in commissions, decreased loss adjusting fees and subrogation income.\nBenefits and losses expenses were $12.4 million and $14.2 million for the years\nended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease resulted from favorable loss experience.\nAs a result of the above-mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, pretax earnings from operations were $42.9 million and $27.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance\n2018 Compared with 2017\nNet premiums were $63.5 million and $58.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A significant portion of Repwest\u2019s premiums are from policies sold in conjunction with U-Haul rental transactions. The premium growth corresponded with the increased moving and storage transactions at U-Haul.\nNet investment and interest income was $12.3 million and $15.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The main driver of the change in net investment income was the increase in realized losses of $5.7 million due to market changes in our equity securities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Updated accounting guidance now requires changes in the market value of equity securities held for investment to be recognized through income.\nNet operating expenses were $34.2 million and $32.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change was due to an increase in commissions, decreased loss adjusting fees and subrogation income.\nBenefits and losses expenses were $14.2 million and $16.0 million for the years\nended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease resulted from favorable loss experience.\nAs a result of the above-mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, pretax earnings from operations were $27.4 million and $25.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nLife Insurance\n2019 Compared with 2018\nNet premiums were $128.0 million and $63.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Life insurance premiums increased by $76.8 million primarily due to a reinsurance agreement termination in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, reducing prior year premiums by $76.0 million.\nMedicare Supplement premiums decreased by $11.2 million due to minimal new sales and declined premiums on the existing business offset by rate increases on renewal premiums. In addition, the remaining lines of business premiums decreased by $1.2 million. Deferred annuity deposits were $221.5 million or $148.6 million below prior year and are accounted for on balance sheet as deposits rather than premiums.\nNet investment and interest income was $109.0 million and $86.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net investment income from fixed maturities increased $10.5 million from a larger invested assets base. The increase in realized capital gains and mortgage prepayment gain was $8.0 million, coupled with an $8.0 million increase in realized gains on derivatives used as economic hedges for our fixed indexed annuities. This was partially offset by a $3.9 million decrease in the investment income from other invested assets, primarily from a reduced investment in mortgage loans.\nNet operating expenses were $21.4 million and $14.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The variance was primarily due to a $6.5 million increase in life insurance commission expense offset by a $0.3 million reduction in Medicare supplement commission expense.\nThe increase in life insurance commission expense was primarily due to a prior year commission expense reduction in the fourth quarter of 2018 from a commission allowance on a reinsurance agreement termination. In addition, there was an increase of $0.6 million in general expenses.\nBenefits and losses expenses were $162.4 million and $86.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Life insurance benefits increased by a $73.5 million due to the reinsurance agreement termination in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, reducing prior year life benefits by $71.6 million. An additional increase of $1.9 million in life benefits was a result of adverse mortality. The interest credited to policyholders increased by $15.1 million on a larger annuity deposit base. This was offset by a $11.0 million decrease in Medicare supplement benefits from the declined policies in force and a $1.3 million in supplementary annuity contract disbursements and the remaining lines.\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs (\u201cDAC\u201d), sales inducement asset (\u201cSIA\u201c) and the value of business acquired (\u201cVOBA\u201d) was $31.2 million and $28.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase of $6.2 million was primarily due to a higher DAC amortization on annuities from the increased asset base supported by continued sales. This was offset by a $ 3.5 million decrease in VOBA amortization, a result of a VOBA write off in the prior year due to a reinsurance agreement termination.\nAs a result of the above-mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, pretax earnings from operations were $26.4 million and $25.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLife Insurance\n2018 Compared with 2017\nNet premiums were $63.5 million and $154.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There was a one-time decrease in life insurance premiums of $78.4 million due to the transfer of liabilities as a result of the Reinsurance contract termination, effective November 30, 2018. Medicare Supplement premiums decreased by $12.6 million due to the reduction in new sales and policy decrements on the existing business offset by premium rate increases. Premiums on other lines of business increased $0.2 million. Deferred annuity deposits were $370.1 million or $73.8 million above the prior year and are accounted for on the balance sheet as deposits rather than premiums.\nNet investment and interest income was $86.4 million and $84.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Investment income from fixed maturities and other invested assets increased $10.1 million from a larger invested asset base, partially offset by a $2.8 million decrease in realized losses and a $5.1 million loss on derivatives.\nNet operating expenses were $14.6 million and $22.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease was due to a one-time commission allowance of $6.8 million received on the reinsurance agreement termination which was recorded as a reduction to commission expense and a reduction in commission expense from the decreased Medicare supplement premiums.\nBenefits and losses expenses were $86.1 million and $169.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There was a one-time decrease of $76.4 million in Life benefits due to the transfer of liabilities for the Reinsurance contract termination. Medicare supplement and other health benefits decreased $9.8 million from the declined policies in force. Partially offsetting this was a $3.2 million increase in interest credited to policyholders on a larger annuity deposit base.\nAmortization of DAC, SIA and VOBA was $28.6 million and $24.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was primarily due to a one-time $3.3 million VOBA write-off as a result of the Reinsurance contract termination. In addition, there was an increase in annuity DAC amortization due to the increased amount of annuity business sold during fiscal 2019 . Conversely, DAC amortization associated with Medicare Supplement has decreased as a result of the declining business inforce.\nAs a result of the above-mentioned changes in revenues and expenses, pretax earnings from operations were $25.5 million and $28.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe our current capital structure is a positive factor that will enable us to pursue our operational plans and goals and provide us with sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future. There are many factors which could affect our liquidity, including some which are beyond our control, and there is no assurance that future cash flows and liquidity resources will be sufficient to meet our outstanding debt obligations and our other future capital needs.\nAt March 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents totaled $494.4 million, compared with $673.7 million at March 31, 2019. The assets of our insurance subsidiaries are generally unavailable to fulfill the obligations of non-insurance operations (AMERCO, U-Haul and Real Estate). As of March 31, 2020 (or as otherwise indicated), cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets (receivables, short-term investments, other investments, fixed maturities, and related party assets) and debt obligations of each operating segment were:\nMoving & Storage\nProperty and Casualty Insurance (a)\nLife Insurance (a)\n(In thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n459,078\n$\n4,794\n$\n30,480\nOther financial assets\n122,088\n480,275\n2,504,213\nDebt obligations\n4,609,844\n-\n11,447\n(a) As of December 31, 2019\nAt March 31, 2020, Moving and Storage had available borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities of $39.0 million.\nTowards the end of March and into April and May 2020, COVID-19 has negatively affected our operating cash flows through lower self-moving equipment rental revenues along with a near total reduction in equipment sales proceeds stemming from the closures of commercial auto auctions.\nIn March 2020, we drew down $50.0 million from our corporate revolver and in April 2020, we expanded this revolver by an additional $50.0 million and fully borrowed that as well.\nWe entered into $225 million of additional term loans in April and May to further strengthen our liquidity position.\nThese loans have not had a material negative effect on our cost of borrowing.\nWe believe that the Company has adequate liquidity to meet our obligations.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that market conditions resulting from COVID-19 will not worsen and have a material negative effect on our liquidity.\nA summary of our consolidated cash flows for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 is shown in the table below:\nYears Ended March 31,\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,075,513\n$\n975,583\n$\n937,684\nNet cash used by investing activities\n(1,766,649)\n(1,571,136)\n(898,304)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n512,320\n514,582\n16,604\nEffects of exchange rate on cash\n(533)\n(4,716)\n5,598\nNet increase (decrease) in cash flow\n(179,349)\n(85,687)\n61,582\nCash at the beginning of the period\n673,701\n759,388\n697,806\nCash at the end of the period\n$\n494,352\n$\n673,701\n$\n759,388\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $99.9 million in fiscal 2020, compared with fiscal 2019.\nThe reinsurance transaction at the life insurance segment in fiscal 2019 accounts for $64.6 million of the improvement.\nOperating cash from the Moving and Storage segment increased by $21.6 million.\nNet cash used by investing activities increased $195.5 million in fiscal 2020, compared with fiscal 2019. Purchases of property, plant and equipment, which are reported net of cash from sales and lease-back transactions (for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018), increased $439.4 million. Cash from the sales of property, plant and equipment increased $81.1 million largely due to increased fleet sales. Net cash deposited in real estate acquisitions escrow accounts increased $2.3 million. For our insurance subsidiaries, net cash used in investing activities decreased $159.9 million compared with the same period last year.\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $2.3 million in fiscal 2020, compared with fiscal 2019. This was due to a combination of increased debt and capital lease repayments of $54.6 million, an increase in cash from borrowings of $224.1 million, a decrease in net annuity deposits from Life Insurance of $183.7 million and a decrease in common stock dividends paid of $9.8 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources and Requirements of Our Operating Segments\nMoving and Storage\nTo meet the needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment. Capital expenditures have primarily consisted of new rental equipment acquisitions and the buyouts of existing fleet from leases. The capital to fund these expenditures has historically been obtained internally from operations and the sale of used equipment and externally from debt and lease financing. In the future, we anticipate that our internally generated funds will be used to service the existing debt and fund operations. U-Haul estimates that during fiscal 2021 the Company will reinvest in its truck and trailer rental fleet approximately $460 million, net of equipment sales and excluding any lease buyouts. For fiscal 2020, the Company invested, net of sales, approximately $700 million before any lease buyouts in its truck and trailer fleet. Fleet investments in fiscal 2021 and beyond will be dependent upon several factors including the availability of capital, the truck rental environment and the used-truck sales market. We anticipate that the fiscal 2021 investments will be funded largely through debt financing, external lease financing and cash from operations. Management considers several factors including cost and tax consequences when selecting a method to fund capital expenditures. Our allocation between debt and lease financing can change from year to year based upon financial market conditions which may alter the cost or availability of financing options.\nBased upon interactions with our existing lenders, the Company does not believe that COVID-19 will materially inhibit our ability to obtain financing for the purchases of rental equipment in fiscal 2021.\nShould the situation severely worsen this belief could change.\nReal Estate has traditionally financed the acquisition of self-storage properties to support U-Haul's growth through debt financing and funds from operations. The Company\u2019s plan for the expansion of owned storage properties includes the acquisition of existing self-storage locations from third parties, the acquisition and development of bare land, and the acquisition and redevelopment of existing buildings not currently used for self-storage. The Company expects to fund these development projects through a combination of internally generated funds along with borrowings against existing properties as they operationally mature. For fiscal 2020, the Company invested $751 million in real estate acquisitions, new construction and renovation and repair compared to $1.0 billion in fiscal 2019.\nFor fiscal 2021, the timing of new projects will be dependent upon several factors, including the entitlement process, availability of capital, weather, the identification and successful acquisition of target properties and any lingering effects of COVID-19.\nIn April and May of 2020, the Company has opted to slow the development of new self-storage projects to preserve liquidity.\nWe will calibrate our capital spending based in part upon the evolving effects of COVID-19.\nU-Haul's growth plan in self-storage also includes the expansion of the U-Haul Storage Affiliate program, which does not require significant capital.\nNet capital expenditures (purchases of property, plant and equipment less proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and lease proceeds) were $1,622.0 million, $1,263.7 million and $663.9 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The components of our net capital expenditures are provided in the following table:\nYears Ended March 31,\n(In thousands)\nPurchases of rental equipment\n$\n1,374,141\n$\n1,162,909\n$\n1,006,503\nEquipment lease buyouts\n63,973\n30,566\n6,594\nPurchases of real estate, construction and renovations\n751,395\n1,003,030\n606,990\nOther capital expenditures\n119,897\n21,831\n140,627\nGross capital expenditures\n2,309,406\n2,218,336\n1,760,714\nLess: Lease proceeds\n-\n(348,368)\n(396,969)\nLess: Sales of property, plant and equipment\n(687,375)\n(606,271)\n(699,803)\nNet capital expenditures\n1,622,031\n1,263,697\n663,942\nMoving and Storage continues to hold significant cash and we believe has access to additional liquidity. Management may invest these funds in our existing operations, expand our product lines or pursue external opportunities in the self-moving and storage marketplace, pay dividends or reduce existing indebtedness where possible.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance\nState insurance regulations may restrict the amount of dividends that can be paid to stockholders of insurance companies. As a result, Property and Casualty Insurance's assets are generally not available to satisfy the claims of AMERCO, or its legal subsidiaries. For calendar year 2020, the ordinary dividend available to be paid to AMERCO is $22.7 million. For more information, please see Note 21, Statutory Financial Information of Insurance Subsidiaries, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nWe believe that stockholders\u2019 equity at the Property and Casualty operating segment remains sufficient and we do not believe that its ability to pay ordinary dividends to AMERCO will be restricted per state regulations.\nOur Property and Casualty operating segment stockholders\u2019 equity was $251.1 million, $222.4 million, and $211.2 million as of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase in 2019 compared with 2018 resulted from net earnings of $33.9 million, an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $16.4 million and offset by the $21.6 million dividend paid to AMERCO. Property and Casualty Insurance does not use debt or equity issues to increase capital and therefore has no direct exposure to capital market conditions other than through its investment portfolio.\nLife Insurance\nLife Insurance manages its financial assets to meet policyholder and other obligations including investment contract withdrawals and deposits. Life Insurance's net deposits for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $83.6 million. State insurance regulations may restrict the amount of dividends that can be paid to stockholders of insurance companies. As a result, Life Insurance's assets are generally not available to satisfy the claims of AMERCO \u00ae or its legal subsidiaries. For calendar year 2020, the ordinary dividend available to be paid to AMERCO is $18.6 million. For more information, please see Note 21, Statutory Financial Information of Insurance Subsidiaries, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur Life Insurance operating segment stockholders\u2019 equity was $417.4 million, $311.7 million, and $332.9 million as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in 2019 compared with 2018 resulted from earnings of $21.9 million and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $83.8 million primarily due to the effect of interest rate changes on the fixed maturity portion of the investment portfolio. Life Insurance has not historically used debt or equity issues to increase capital and therefore has not had any significant direct exposure to capital market conditions other than through its investment portfolio. However, as of December 31, 2019, Oxford had outstanding advances of $60.0 million through its membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d). For a more detailed discussion of these advances, please see Note 9, Borrowings, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash Provided from Operating Activities by Operating Segments\nMoving and Storage\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $980.5 million, $958.9 million and $858.6 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 from operations.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $22.5 million, $19.8 million, and $21.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase was the result of an increase in net earnings.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance\u2019s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolios amounted to $11.8 million, $11.2 million, and $17.0 million as of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. These balances reflect funds in transition from maturity proceeds to long-term investments. Management believes this level of liquid assets, combined with budgeted cash flow, is adequate to meet foreseeable cash needs. Capital and operating budgets allow Property and Casualty Insurance to schedule cash needs in accordance with investment and underwriting proceeds.\nLife Insurance\nNet cash provided (used) by operating activities was $72.5 million, ($3.2) million and $57.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. An increase of $ 64.6 million resulted from a prior year reduction due to a cash transfer to State Mutual Insurance Company under reinsurance agreement termination . The remaining increase of $11.1 million was primarily due to an increase in investment income on a larger invested asset base and along with timing of settlement of payables, offset by an increase in federal tax expense.\nIn addition to cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, a substantial amount of liquid funds are available through Life Insurance's short-term portfolio and its membership in the FHLB. As of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments amounted to $30.5 million, $24.1 million and $50.7 million, respectively. Management believes that the overall sources of liquidity are adequate to meet foreseeable cash needs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources - Summary\nWe believe we have the financial resources needed to meet our business plans including our working capital needs. We continue to hold significant cash and have access to additional liquidity to meet our anticipated capital expenditure requirements for investment in our rental fleet, rental equipment and storage acquisitions and build outs.\nAs a result of the federal income tax provisions of the CARES Act, we have filed applicable forms with the IRS to carryback net operating losses and requested refunds of previous deposits totaling approximately $235 million.\nWe believe that upon the filing of our March 31, 2020 federal income tax return additional refunds in excess of $250 million will be due to the Company.\nThese amounts are expected to provide us additional liquidity in fiscal 2021. It is possible future legislation could negatively impact our ability to receive these tax refunds.\nOur borrowing strategy is primarily focused on asset-backed financing and rental equipment leases. As part of this strategy, we seek to ladder maturities and fix interest rates. While each of these loans typically contains provisions governing the amount that can be borrowed in relation to specific assets, the overall structure is flexible with no limits on overall Company borrowings. Management believes it has adequate liquidity between cash and cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity in existing credit facilities to meet the current and expected needs of the Company over the next several years. As of March 31, 2020, we had available borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities of $39.0 million.\nWhile it is possible that circumstances beyond our control could alter the ability of the financial institutions to lend us the unused lines of credit, in April the Company did draw down these remaining amounts successfully.\nWe believe that there are additional opportunities for leverage in our existing capital structure. For a more detailed discussion of our long-term debt and borrowing capacity, please see Note 9, Borrowings, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report.\nDisclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table provides contractual commitments and contingencies as of March 31, 2020:\nPayment due by Period (as of March 31, 2020)\nContractual Obligations\nTotal\n04/01/20 - 03/31/21\n04/01/21 - 03/31/23\n04/01/23 - 03/31/25\nThereafter\n(In thousands)\nNotes and loans payable - Principal\n$\n2,431,364\n$\n159,186\n384,015\n$\n521,767\n$\n1,366,396\nNotes and loans payable - Interest\n692,069\n100,651\n180,572\n139,460\n271,386\nRevolving credit agreements - Principal\n1,086,000\n-\n735,111\n350,889\n-\nRevolving credit agreements - Interest\n88,113\n31,008\n48,003\n9,102\n-\nFinance/capital leases - Principal\n734,870\n218,424\n288,350\n181,658\n46,438\nFinance/capital leases - Interest\n62,376\n22,445\n27,688\n10,991\n1,252\nFinance liability - Principal\n398,834\n81,574\n115,145\n94,209\n107,906\nFinance liability - Interest\n46,184\n12,760\n18,269\n11,069\n4,086\nOperating lease liabilities\n162,144\n23,782\n43,239\n30,317\n64,806\nProperty and casualty obligations (a)\n122,044\n22,984\n22,574\n15,633\n60,853\nLife, health and annuity obligations (b)\n3,352,451\n431,226\n684,228\n534,165\n1,702,832\nSelf insurance accruals (c)\n410,107\n123,375\n162,637\n70,399\n53,696\nPost retirement benefit liability\n19,347\n1,151\n2,897\n3,718\n11,581\nTotal contractual obligations\n$\n9,605,903\n$\n1,228,566\n$\n2,712,728\n$\n1,973,377\n$\n3,691,232\n(a) These estimated obligations for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include case reserves for reported claims and IBNR claims estimates and are net of expected reinsurance recoveries. The ultimate amount to settle both the case reserves and IBNR is an estimate based upon historical experience and current trends and such estimates could materially differ from actual results. The assumptions do not include future premiums. Due to the significant assumptions employed in this model, the amounts shown could materially differ from actual results.\n(b) These estimated obligations are based on mortality, morbidity, withdrawal and lapse assumptions drawn from our historical experience and adjusted for any known trends. These obligations include expected interest crediting but no amounts for future annuity deposits or premiums for life and Medicare supplement policies.\nThe cash flows shown above are undiscounted for interest and as a result total outflows for all years shown significantly exceed the corresponding liabilities of $2,179.4 million included in our consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2020. Life Insurance expects to fully fund these obligations from their invested asset portfolio. Due to the significant assumptions employed in this model, the amounts shown could materially differ from actual results.\n(c) These estimated obligations are primarily the Company\u2019s self insurance accruals for portions of the liability coverage for our rental equipment. The estimates for future settlement are based upon historical experience and current trends. Due to the significant assumptions employed in this model, the amounts shown could materially differ from actual results.\nAs presented above, contractual obligations on debt and guarantees represent principal payments while contractual obligations for operating leases represent the notional payments under the lease arrangements.\nASC 740 - Income Taxes liabilities and interest of $42.4 million is not included above due to uncertainty surrounding ultimate settlements, if any.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company uses off-balance sheet arrangements in situations where management believes that the economics and sound business principles warrant their use.\nHistorically, we used certain off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with the expansion of our self-storage business. For more information please see Note 20, Related Party Transactions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report. These arrangements were primarily used when our overall borrowing structure was more limited. We do not face similar limitations currently and off-balance sheet arrangements have not been utilized in our self-storage expansion in recent years. In the future, we will continue to identify and consider off-balance sheet opportunities to the extent such arrangements would be economically advantageous to us and our stockholders.\nFiscal 2021 Outlook\nWe will continue to focus our attention on increasing transaction volume and improving pricing, product and utilization for self-moving equipment rentals.\nMaintaining an adequate level of new investment in our truck fleet is an important component of our plan to meet our operational goals. Revenue in the U-Move \u00ae program could be adversely impacted should we fail to execute in any of these areas. Even if we execute our plans, we could see declines in revenues primarily due to unforeseen events including adverse economic conditions or heightened competition that is beyond our control.\nWith respect to our storage business, in fiscal 2020 we have added new locations and expanded existing locations. In fiscal 2021, we are actively looking to complete current projects, increase occupancy in our existing portfolio of locations and acquire new locations. New projects and acquisitions will be considered and pursued if they fit our long-term plans and meet our financial objectives. We will continue to invest capital and resources in the U-Box \u00ae program throughout fiscal 2021.\nIn light of COVID-19 and its lingering effects, we may be challenged in our progress.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance will continue to provide loss adjusting and claims handling for U-Haul and underwrite components of the Safemove \u00ae , Safetow \u00ae , Safemove Plus \u00ae , Safestor \u00ae , and Safestor Mobile \u00ae protection packages to U-Haul customers.\nLife Insurance is pursuing its goal of expanding its presence in the senior market through the sales of its Medicare supplement, life and annuity policies. This strategy includes growing its agency force, expanding its new product offerings, and pursuing business acquisition opportunities.\nQuarterly Results (unaudited)\nThe quarterly results shown below are derived from unaudited financial statements for the eight quarters beginning April 1, 2018 and ending March 31, 2020. We believe that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly, and in accordance with GAAP, such results. Moving and Storage operations are seasonal and proportionally more of the Company\u2019s revenues and net earnings from its Moving and Storage operations are generated in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year (April through September). The operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period.\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31, 2020\nDecember 31, 2019\nSeptember 30, 2019\nJune 30, 2019\n(In thousands, except for share and per share data)\nTotal revenues\n$\n821,525\n$\n927,880\n$\n1,150,214\n$\n1,079,249\nEarnings from operations\n80,565\n244,740\n213,865\nEarnings available to common\nshareholders\n122,368\n30,932\n156,326\n132,422\nBasic and diluted earnings\nper common share\n$\n6.24\n$\n1.58\n$\n7.97\n$\n6.76\nWeighted average common shares\noutstanding: basic and diluted\n19,607,788\n19,607,788\n19,602,566\n19,597,697\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31, 2019\nDecember 31, 2018\nSeptember 30, 2018\nJune 30, 2018\n(In thousands, except for share and per share data)\nTotal revenues\n$\n725,532\n$\n919,091\n$\n1,104,507\n$\n1,019,577\nEarnings from operations\n27,237\n138,102\n250,944\n204,704\nEarnings available to common\nshareholders\n78,635\n163,542\n127,849\nBasic and diluted earnings\nper common share\n$\n0.04\n$\n4.01\n$\n8.35\n$\n6.53\nWeighted average common shares\noutstanding: basic and diluted\n19,594,008\n19,591,963\n19,591,312\n19,590,585",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To mitigate these risks, we may utilize derivative financial instruments, among other strategies. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate debt obligations and one variable rate operating lease. We have used interest rate swap agreements and forward swaps to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates. We enter into these arrangements with counterparties that are significant financial institutions with whom we generally have other financial arrangements. We are exposed to credit risk should these counterparties not be able to perform on their obligations. Following is a summary of our interest rate swaps agreements at March 31, 2020:\nNotional Amount\nFair Value\nEffective Date\nExpiration Date\nFixed Rate\nFloating Rate\n(In thousands)\n$\n85,000\n$\n(2,775)\n6/28/2019\n6/15/2022\n1.76%\n1 Month LIBOR\n75,000\n(2,564)\n6/28/2019\n6/30/2022\n1.78%\n1 Month LIBOR\n75,000\n(2,875)\n6/28/2019\n10/31/2022\n1.77%\n1 Month LIBOR\nAs of March 31, 2020, we had $1,178.9 million of variable rate debt obligations. If the LIBOR were to increase 100 basis points, the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by $9.4 million annually (after consideration of the effect of the above derivative contracts). Certain senior mortgages have an anticipated repayment date and a maturity date. If these senior mortgages are not repaid by the anticipated repayment date the interest rate on these mortgages would increase from the current fixed rate. We are using the anticipated repayment date for our maturity schedule.\nAdditionally, our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 fixed income investment portfolios expose us to interest rate risk. This interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates. As part of our insurance companies\u2019 asset and liability management, actuaries estimate the cash flow patterns of our existing liabilities to determine their duration. These outcomes are compared to the characteristics of the assets that are currently supporting these liabilities assisting management in determining an asset allocation strategy for future investments that management believes will mitigate the overall effect of interest rates.\nWe use derivatives to hedge our equity market exposure to indexed annuity products sold by our Life Insurance company. These contracts earn a return for the contractholder based on the change in the value of the S&P 500 index between annual index point dates. We buy and sell listed equity and index call options and call option spreads. The credit risk is with the party in which the options are written. The net option price is paid up front and there are no additional cash requirements or additional contingent liabilities. These contracts are held at fair market value on our balance sheet. At March 31, 2020 and 2019, these derivative hedges had a net market value of $5.9 million and $1.5 million, with notional amounts of $246.8\nmillion and $284.0\nmillion, respectively. These derivative instruments are included in Investments, other; on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAlthough the call options are employed to be effective hedges against our policyholder obligations from an economic standpoint, they do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under GAAP. Accordingly, the call options are marked to fair value on each reporting date with the change in fair value, plus or minus, included as a component of net investment and interest income. The change in fair value of the call options includes the gains or losses recognized at the expiration of the option term and the changes in fair value for open contracts.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nThe exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our Canadian business. Approximately 4.6% of our revenue was generated in Canada in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018. The result of a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar would not be material to net income. We typically do not hedge any foreign currency risk since the exposure is not considered material.",

This \"Controls and Procedures\" section includes information concerning the controls and procedures evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented in the section Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\nFollowing this discussion is the report of BDO USA, LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, regarding its audit of AMERCO\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as set forth below in this section. This section should be read in conjunction with the certifications of our CEO and CFO and the BDO USA, LLP report for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company\u2019s management, with the participation of the CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company\u2019s \"disclosure controls and procedures\" (as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) (\u201cDisclosure Controls\u201d) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Our Disclosure Controls are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Our Disclosure Controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our Disclosure Controls were effective at a reasonable assurance level related to the above stated design purposes.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nThe Company's management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of our controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere has not been any change in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020, the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management's assessment included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment. This assessment is supported by testing and monitoring performed both by our Internal Audit function and our Finance function.\nBased on our assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year 2020. We reviewed the results of management's assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, BDO USA, LLP, has audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting and has issued their report, which is included on the following page.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nStockholders and Board of Directors\nAMERCO\nReno, Nevada\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited AMERCO and consolidated subsidiaries\u2019 (the \u201cCompany\u201d) internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the \u201cCOSO criteria\u201d). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria .\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2020, and the related notes and schedules and our report dated May 27, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nPhoenix, Arizona\nMay 27, 2020",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2020 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d) and our report dated May 27, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, effective April 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases (Topic 842).\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves (U-Haul)\nAs described in Notes 3 and 22A to the consolidated financial statements, U-Haul retains the risk for certain public liability and property damage programs related to its rental equipment, which is referred to as self-insurance. The estimated U-Haul self-insurance reserve as of March 31, 2020 was $410 million and was recorded in the consolidated balance sheets within policy benefits and losses, claims and loss expenses payable.\nThe self-insurance reserve estimate requires significant management judgment and is based upon historical claims experience, current claim trends, and actuarial estimates.\nWe identified the valuation of self-insurance reserves as a critical audit matter. Significant and complex management judgments and assumptions, including the use of management specialists in actuarial methods, is required to evaluate historical claims experience, current claims trends and actuarial estimates, including (i) estimates of future incurred and paid losses, and (ii) initial expected claim costs. Auditing these complex judgments and assumptions involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skills or knowledge needed.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following:\nTesting the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls surrounding the U-Haul self-insurance reserve process, including controls over: (i) existence and accuracy of historical claims data used by the actuary, and (ii) management\u2019s review of the external actuary\u2019s estimate of the self-insurance reserves.\nTesting the completeness and accuracy of claims data utilized by the actuary by selecting a sample of claims and corroborating key attributes of claims detail.\nUtilizing personnel with specialized knowledge and skill in actuarial methods to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology and key assumptions utilized by the external actuary including the future development of incurred and paid losses, initial expected claim cost per exposure and retrospective review of prior year estimates.\nValuation of Future Policy Benefits (Oxford)\nAs discussed in Notes 3, 17 and 22A of the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s life insurance subsidiary (\u201cOxford\u201d), sells life insurance, Medicare supplement insurance, and deferred annuities. Liabilities for future policy benefits are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets within policy benefits and losses, claims and loss expenses payable. Management\u2019s estimate of liabilities for future policy benefits as of December 31, 2019 was $377 million. The liability is determined by Management utilizing the net premium valuation methodology and is accrued when premium revenue is recognized. The liability, which represents the present value of future benefits to be paid to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums, is estimated using assumptions applicable at the time the insurance contracts are written, with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as appropriate. The Company periodically performs a gross premium valuation and reviews original assumptions, including capitalized expenses which reduce the gross premium valuation, to evaluate whether assets and the liabilities are adequate and whether a loss should be recognized.\nWe identified the valuation of future policy benefits for life and annuity policies as a critical audit matter. Significant and complex management judgments and assumptions included\nexpected mortality experience, policy lapses and surrenders, asset yields and expenses, and expected interest rate yields. Management specialists in actuarial methods are utilized to evaluate the valuation of future policy benefits to determine whether loss recognition is required. Auditing these complex judgments and assumptions involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skills or knowledge needed.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\u202f\nTesting the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls used to estimate future policy benefits including controls over: (i) the appropriateness and completeness of underlying data and the reasonableness of assumptions used, (ii) the reasonableness of internal actuary\u2019s forecasted cash flows and evaluation of results of the gross premium valuation, and (iii) review of management\u2019s estimation process around capitalized expenses.\nTesting the completeness and accuracy of a sample of the data utilized to calculate management\u2019s assumptions as the basis for the gross premium valuation.\nUtilizing a specialist with knowledge and skill in actuarial methods to assist in reviewing the methodology and assumptions used in the gross premium valuation, including (i) assessing the reasonableness of assumptions used through independent calculations, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of the amortization of capitalized expenses, (iii)\ne valuating the applicability of the assumptions and sources of management\u2019s calculation at the time the insurance contracts were written and, (iv) reviewing the reasonableness of the gross premium valuation, including evaluating whether loss recognition is warranted.\nReserve for Property & Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses (Repwest)\nAs described in Notes 3, 17 and 22A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiary (\u201cRepwest\u201d) recorded $209 million of reserves for property and casualty (\u201cP&C\u201d) losses and loss adjustment expenses at December 31, 2019. Reserves for P&C losses and loss adjustment expenses are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets within policy benefits and losses, claims and loss expenses payable. Insurance reserves for P&C take into account losses incurred based upon actuarial estimates and are management\u2019s best approximation of future payments. These estimates are based upon past claims experience and current claim trends as well as actuarial estimates. Changes in judgments and assumptions could materially impact the valuation of these liabilities, particularly for exposure with a long period of time between the insured period and settlement of all claims, such as, excess workers\u2019 compensation claims.\nWe identified the reserve for P&C losses and loss adjustment expense as a critical audit matter. Significant and complex management judgments and assumptions, including the use of management specialists in actuarial methods, is required to evaluate past claims experience, current claim trends and actuarial estimates , including expected length of claims and cost trends associated with claimant treatments.\nAuditing these complex judgments and assumptions involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skill or knowledge needed.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\nTesting the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls surrounding the reserve for P&C losses and loss adjustment expense reserves process , including controls over (i) existence and accuracy of historical claims data used by the actuary, and (ii) management\u2019s review of the external actuary\u2019s estimate of the P&C losses and loss adjustment expense.\nTesting the completeness and accuracy of claims data utilized by the actuary by selecting a sample of claims and corroborating key attributes of claims detail.\nUtilizing personnel with specialized knowledge and skill in actuarial methods to assist in\nevaluating the appropriateness of the methodology and the assumptions used by management\u2019s actuary including (i) performing a retrospective review of the prior year reserve estimate against actual performance, and (ii) performing independent estimates around certain actuarial assumptions related to expected and incurred loss development between the financial reporting date and the projected date when all claims ultimately settle .\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since

consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nNote 1. Basis of Presentation\nAMERCO, a Nevada Corporation (\u201cAMERCO\u201d), has a fiscal year that ends on the 31 st of March for each year that is referenced. Our insurance company subsidiaries have fiscal years that end on the 31 st of December for each year that is referenced. They have been consolidated on that basis. Our insurance companies\u2019 financial reporting processes conform to calendar year reporting as required by state insurance departments. Management believes that consolidating their calendar year into our fiscal year financial statements does not materially affect the financial position or results of operations. We disclose material events, if any, occurring during the intervening period. Consequently, all references to our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 years 2019, 2018 and 2017 correspond to fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 for AMERCO.\nAccounts denominated in non-U.S. currencies have been translated into U.S. dollars. Certain amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Please see Note 3, Accounting Policies - Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNote 2. Principles of Consolidation\nWe apply Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 810 - Consolidation (\u201cASC 810\u201d) in our principles of consolidation. ASC 810 addresses arrangements where a company does not hold a majority of the voting or similar interests of a variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d). A company is required to consolidate a VIE if it has determined it is the primary beneficiary. ASC 810 also addresses the policy when a company owns a majority of the voting or similar rights and exercises effective control.\nA VIE is not self-supportive due to having one or both of the following conditions: (i) it has an insufficient amount of equity for it to finance its activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support or (ii) its owners do not hold the typical risks and rights of equity owners. This determination is made upon the creation of a variable interest and is re-assessed on an on-going basis should certain changes in the operations of a VIE, or its relationship with the primary beneficiary trigger a reconsideration. After a reconsideration event occurs the most recent facts and circumstances are utilized in determining whether or not a company is a VIE, which other company(ies) have a variable interest in the entity, and whether or not the company\u2019s interest is such that it is the primary beneficiary.\nWe will continue to monitor our relationships with the other entities regarding who is the primary beneficiary, which could change based on facts and circumstances of any reconsideration events. Please see Note 20, Related Party Transactions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, which are consolidated under the voting interest model. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nDescription of Legal Entities\nAMERCO is the holding company for:\nU-Haul International, Inc. (\u201cU-Haul\u201d);\nAmerco Real Estate Company (\u201cReal Estate\u201d);\nRepwest Insurance Company (\u201cRepwest\u201d); and\nOxford Life Insurance Company (\u201cOxford\u201d).\nUnless the context otherwise requires, the terms \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d refer to AMERCO and all of its legal subsidiaries.\nDescription of Operating Segments\nAMERCO has three (\n) reportable segments. They are Moving and Storage, Property and Casualty Insurance and Life Insurance.\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nMoving and Storage includes AMERCO, U-Haul, and Real Estate and the wholly-owned subsidiaries of U-Haul and Real Estate. Operations consist of the rental of trucks and trailers, sales of moving supplies, sales of towing accessories, sales of propane, and the rental of fixed and portable moving and storage units to the \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d mover and management of self-storage properties owned by others. Operations are conducted under the registered trade name U-Haul \u00ae throughout the United States and Canada.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance includes Repwest and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and ARCOA Risk Retention Group (\u201cARCOA\u201d). Property and Casualty Insurance provides loss adjusting and claims handling for U-Haul through regional offices in the United States and Canada. Property and Casualty Insurance also underwrites components of the Safemove \u00ae , Safetow \u00ae , Safemove Plus \u00ae , Safestor \u00ae and Safestor Mobile \u00ae protection packages to U-Haul customers. The business plan for Property and Casualty Insurance includes offering property and casualty products in other U-Haul related programs. ARCOA is a group captive insurer owned by us and our wholly owned subsidiaries whose purpose is to provide insurance products related to our moving and storage business.\nLife Insurance includes Oxford and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Life Insurance provides life and health insurance products primarily to the senior market through the direct writing and reinsuring of life insurance, Medicare supplement and annuity policies.\nNote 3.\nAccounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) in the United States requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The accounting policies that we deem most critical to us and that require management\u2019s most difficult and subjective judgments include the principles of consolidation, the recoverability of property, plant and equipment, the adequacy of insurance reserves, the recognition and measurement of impairments for investments accounted for under ASC 320 - Investments - Debt and Equity Securities and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The actual results experienced by us may materially differ from management\u2019s estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider cash equivalents to be highly liquid debt securities with insignificant interest rate risk with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits. Accounts at each United States financial institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $\n250,000\n. Accounts at each Canadian financial institution are insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $\n100,000\nCAD per account. As of March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019, we held cash equivalents in excess of these insured limits. To mitigate this risk, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength.\nInvestments\nFixed Maturities and Marketable Equities. Fixed maturity investments consist of either marketable debt, equity or redeemable preferred stocks. As of the balance sheet dates, all of our investments in these securities were classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses recorded net of taxes and applicable adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs in stockholders\u2019 equity. Changes in the market value of common stocks are recognized in earnings. Fair value for these investments is based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. The cost of investments sold is based on the specific identification method.\nIn determining if and when a decline in market value below carrying value is an other-than-temporary impairment, management makes certain assumptions or judgments in its assessment including but not limited to: our ability to hold the security, quoted market prices, dealer quotes, discounted cash flows, industry factors, financial factors, and issuer specific information. Other-than-temporary impairments, to the extent of the decline, as well as realized gains or losses on the sale or exchange of investments are recognized in the current period operating results.\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nMortgage Loans and Notes on Real Estate. Mortgage loans and notes on real estate are reported at their unpaid balance, net of any allowance for possible losses and any unamortized premium or discount.\nRecognition of Investment Income. Interest income from bonds and mortgage notes is recognized when earned. Dividends on common and preferred stocks are recognized on the ex-dividend dates. Realized gains and losses on the sale or exchange of investments are recognized at the trade date.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nOur objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage interest rate risk exposure primarily through entering interest rate swap agreements and call options. We do not enter into these instruments for trading purposes. Counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements are major financial institutions. Derivatives are recognized at fair value on the balance sheet and are classified as prepaid expenses (asset) or accrued expenses (liability). Derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative qualifies and is designated as a cash flow hedge, changes in its fair value will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. See Note 11, Derivatives, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInventories and parts, net\nInventories and parts, net were as follows:\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands)\nTruck and trailer parts and accessories (a)\n$\n88,138\n$\n94,344\nHitches and towing components (b)\n23,070\n20,113\nMoving supplies and propane (b)\n11,824\n10,356\nSubtotal\n123,032\n124,813\nLess: LIFO reserves\n(18,886)\n(18,987)\nLess: excess and obsolete reserves\n(3,063)\n(2,322)\nTotal\n$\n101,083\n$\n103,504\n(a) Primarily held for internal usage, including equipment manufacturing and repair\n(b) Primarily held for retail sales\nInventories consist primarily of truck and trailer parts and accessories used to manufacture and repair rental equipment as well as products and accessories available for retail sale. Inventory is held at our owned locations; our independent dealers do not hold any of our inventory. Inventories are stated at the lower cost or net realizable value.\nInventory cost is primarily determined using the last-in first-out method (\u201cLIFO\u201d). Inventories valued using LIFO consisted of approximately\n% of the total inventories for March 31, 2020 and 2019. Had we utilized the first-in first-out method (\u201cFIFO\u201d), stated inventory balances would have been $18.9 million and $19.0 million higher as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In fiscal 2020, the negative effect on income due to liquidation of a portion of the LIFO inventory was $\n0.1\nmillion.\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nOur Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Interest expense, if any, incurred during the initial construction of buildings is considered part of cost. Depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes using the straight line or an accelerated method based on a declining balance formula over the following estimated useful lives: rental equipment 2-20 years and buildings and non-rental equipment 3-55 years. Routine maintenance costs are charged to operating expense as they are incurred. Gains and losses on dispositions of property, plant and equipment, other than real estate (\u201cpersonal property\u201d), are netted against depreciation expense when realized. The net amount of gains, netted against depreciation expense, were $\n27.1\nmillion, $\n27.0\nmillion and $\n11.8\nmillion during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Equipment depreciation is recognized in amounts expected to result in the recovery of estimated residual values upon disposal, i.e., minimize gains or losses. In determining the depreciation rate, historical disposal experience, holding periods and trends in the market for vehicles are reviewed. As a result of changes in IRS regulations regarding the capitalization of assets, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we raised the value threshold before certain assets are capitalized within our depreciation policy. This change in threshold, results in the immediate recognition of reported operating costs with a lagging decrease in depreciation expense over the term that these assets would have been depreciated. Due to this change, we had operating expenses of $\n27.7\nmillion and $\n21.0\nmillion in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. This change in threshold benefited us through the immediate recognition of tax deductible costs.\nWe regularly perform reviews to determine whether facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the carrying amount of assets, including estimates of residual value, may not be recoverable or that the useful life of assets are shorter or longer than originally estimated. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the remaining life of the equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks and trailers. We assess the recoverability of our assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. We consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles and the expected life of vehicles included in the fleet. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. If asset residual values are determined to be recoverable, but the useful lives are shorter or longer than originally estimated, the net book value of the assets is depreciated over the newly determined remaining useful lives.\nFor our box truck fleet we utilize an accelerated method of depreciation based upon a declining formula. Under the declining balances method (2.4 times declining balance), the book value of a rental truck is reduced approximately\n%,\n%,\n%,\n%,\n%,\n%, and\n% during years one through seven, respectively and then reduced on a straight line basis to a salvage value of\n% by the end of year fifteen. Comparatively, a standard straight line approach would reduce the book value by approximately\n5.7\n% per year over the life of the truck.\nAlthough we intend to sell our used vehicles for prices approximating book value, the extent to which we realize a gain or loss on the sale of used vehicles is dependent upon various factors including, but not limited to, the general state of the used vehicle market, the age and condition of the vehicle at the time of its disposal and the depreciation rates with respect to the vehicle . We typically sell our used vehicles at our sales centers throughout the United States and Canada, on our website at uhaul.com/trucksales or by phone at 1-866-404-0355. Additionally, we sell a large portion of our pickup and cargo van fleet at automobile dealer auctions.\nIn addition to our property, plant and equipment, we had real estate held for future development or use of $\n69.6\nmillion and $\n53.5\nmillion for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively and is included in Investments, other.\nReceivables\nTrade receivables include trade accounts from moving and self-storage customers and dealers, insurance premiums and amounts due from re-insurers, less management\u2019s estimate of uncollectible accounts.\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nInsurance premiums receivable for policies that are billed through contracted agents are recorded net of commissions payable. A commission payable is recorded as a separate liability for those premiums that are billed direct.\nReinsurance recoverables include case reserves and actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\"). These receivables are not expected to be collected until after the associated claim has been adjudicated and billed to the re-insurer. The reinsurance recoverables may have little or no allowance for doubtful accounts due to the fact that reinsurance is typically procured from carriers with strong credit ratings. Furthermore, we do not cede losses to a re-insurer if the carrier is deemed financially unable to perform on the contract. Reinsurance recoverables also include insurance ceded to other insurance companies.\nNotes and mortgage receivables include accrued interest and are reduced by discounts and amounts considered by management to be uncollectible.\nPolicy Benefits and Losses, Claims and Loss Expenses Payable\nLiabilities for future policy benefits related to life insurance, Medical supplement insurance, and deferred annuities are determined by management utilizing the net premium valuation methodology and are accrued when premium revenue is recognized. The liability, which represents the present value of future benefits to be paid to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums, is estimated using assumptions applicable at the time the insurance contracts are written, with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as appropriate. Assumptions include expected mortality and morbidity experience, policy lapses and surrenders, current asset yields and expenses, and expected interest rate yields. The Company periodically performs a gross premium valuation and reviews original assumptions, including capitalized expenses which reduce the gross premium valuation, to evaluate whether the assets and liabilities are adequate and whether a loss reserve should be recognized. Liabilities for health, disability and other policies include estimates of payments to be made on insurance claims for reported losses and estimates of IBNR losses. Oxford\u2019s liabilities for deferred annuity contracts consist of contract account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance\u2019s liability for reported and unreported losses is based on Repwest\u2019s historical data along with industry averages. The liability for unpaid loss adjustment expenses is based on historical ratios of loss adjustment expenses paid to losses paid. Amounts recoverable from re-insurers on unpaid losses are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the re-insured policy. Adjustments to the liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses as well as amounts recoverable from re-insurers on unpaid losses are charged or credited to expense in the periods in which they are made.\nDue to the nature of the underlying risks and high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of the liability for future policy benefits and claims, the amounts to be ultimately paid to settle these liabilities cannot be precisely determined and may vary significantly from the estimated liability, especially for long-tailed casualty lines of business such as excess workers\u2019 compensation.\nAs a result of the long-tailed nature of the excess workers\u2019 compensation policies written by Repwest during 1983 through 2001, it may take a number of years for claims to be fully reported and finally settled.\nOn a regular basis insurance reserve adequacy is reviewed by management to determine if existing assumptions need to be updated. In determining the assumptions for calculating workers\u2019 compensation reserves, management considers multiple factors including the following:\nClaimant longevity\nCost trends associated with claimant treatments\nChanges in ceding entity and third party administrator reporting practices\nChanges in environmental factors including legal and regulatory\nCurrent conditions affecting claim settlements\nFuture economic conditions including inflation\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nWe have reserved each claim based upon the accumulation of current claim costs projected through each claimant\u2019s life expectancy and then adjusted for applicable reinsurance arrangements.\nManagement reviews each claim bi-annually or more frequently, if there are changes in facts or circumstances to determine if the estimated life-time claim costs have increased and then adjusts the reserve estimate accordingly at that time.\nWe have factored in an estimate of what the potential cost increases could be in our IBNR liability.\nWe have not assumed settlement of the existing claims in calculating the reserve amount, unless it is in the final stages of completion.\nContinued increases in claim costs, including medical inflation and new treatments and medications could lead to future adverse development resulting in additional reserve strengthening.\nConversely, settlement of existing claims or if injured workers return to work or expire prematurely, could lead to future positive development.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves\nU-Haul retains the risk for certain public liability and property damage programs related to our rental equipment. The consolidated balance sheets include $\n410.1\nmillion and $\n407.9\nmillion of liabilities related to these programs as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These liabilities are recorded in Policy benefits and losses, claims and loss expenses payable. Management takes into account losses incurred based upon actuarial estimates, past experience, current claim trends, as well as social and economic conditions. This liability is subject to change in the future based upon changes in the underlying assumptions including claims experience, frequency of incidents, and severity of incidents.\nAdditionally, as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, the consolidated balance sheets include liabilities of $\n15.7\nmillion and $\n15.6\nmillion, respectively, related to medical plan benefits we provide for eligible employees. We estimate this liability based on actual claims outstanding as of the balance sheet date as well as an actuarial estimate of IBNR claims. These amounts are recorded in Accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets.\nRevenue Recognition\nSelf-moving rentals are recognized for the period that trucks and moving equipment are rented. Self-storage revenues, based upon the number of paid storage contract days, are recognized as earned during the period.\nSales of self-moving and self-storage related products are recognized at the time that title passes and the customer accepts delivery. Property and casualty insurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the policy periods. Traditional life and Medicare supplement insurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the premium-paying periods of the contracts when due from the policyholders. For products where premiums are due over a significantly shorter duration than the period over which benefits are provided, such as our single premium whole life product, premiums are recognized when received and excess profits are deferred and recognized in relation to the insurance in force. Interest and investment income are recognized as earned.\nAmounts collected from customers for sales tax are recorded on a net basis. Please see Note 23, Revenue Recognition, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAdvertising\nAll advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $\n13.7\nmillion, $\n10.6\nmillion and $\n8.1\nmillion in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nCommissions and other costs that fluctuate with and are primarily related to the successful acquisition or renewal of certain insurance premiums are deferred. For our Life Insurance\u2019s life and health insurance products, these costs are amortized, with interest, in relation to revenue such that costs are realized as a constant percentage of revenue. For its annuity insurance products the costs are amortized, with interest, in relation to the present value of actual and expected gross profits.\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nStarting in fiscal 2014, new annuity contract holders were provided with a sales inducement in the form of a premium bonus (the \u201cSales Inducement Asset\u201d).\nSales inducements are recognized as an asset with a corresponding increase to the policyholder liability and are amortized in a similar manner to Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Sales Inducement Asset included with Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs amounted to $\n16.8\nmillion and $\n19.1\nmillion, respectively on the consolidated balance sheet and amortization expense totaled $\n5.5\nmillion, $\n3.7\nmillion and $\n3.7\nmillion for the periods ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nEnvironmental Costs\nLiabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and remedial efforts, if applicable, are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on management\u2019s best estimate of undiscounted future costs. Certain recoverable environmental costs related to the removal of underground storage tanks or related contamination are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the properties. These costs are capitalized if they improve the safety or efficiency of the property or are incurred in preparing the property for sale.\nIncome Taxes\nAMERCO files a consolidated tax return with all of its legal subsidiaries. The provision for income taxes reflects deferred income taxes resulting from changes in temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) consists of net earnings, foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on investments, the change in fair value of cash flow hedges and the change in postretirement benefit obligations.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nWe defer costs directly associated with acquiring third-party financing. Debt issuance costs are deferred and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method. Debt issuance costs related to our long-term debt are reflected as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt. Please see Note 9, Borrowings, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nOn April 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, which require a lessee to recognize all leases with terms greater than 12 months on their balance sheet as a liability for its lease obligation, measured at the present value of lease payments not yet paid, and a corresponding asset representing its right to use the underlying asset over the lease term. The new leasing standard does not significantly change a lessee\u2019s recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows. Additionally, Topic 842 aligns key aspects of lessor accounting with the new revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606 (see\nNote 23, Revenue Recognition) and expands disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements in an attempt to help financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases .\nWe have determined portions of the vehicle rental contracts that convey the right to control the use of identified assets are within the scope of the accounting guidance contained in the new leasing standard. As described in Note 23, Revenue Recognition, the Company\u2019s rental related revenues are accounted for under the revenue accounting standard Topic 606.\nTopic 842 requires leases to be classified as either operating or finance, with lease classification determined in a manner similar to the former lease guidance. The basic principle is that leases of all types convey the right to direct the use and obtain substantially all the economic benefits of an identified asset, meaning they create an asset and liability for lessees. Lessees classify leases as either finance leases (comparable to former capital leases) or operating leases. Costs for a finance lease are split between amortization and interest expense, with operating leases reporting a single lease expense.\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nTopic 842 substantially changed the accounting for sale-leasebacks going forward, where we are to assess if the contract qualifies as a sale under ASC 606. We have determined that our equipment sale-leasebacks do not qualify as a sale, as the buyer-lessors do not obtain control of the assets in our ongoing sale-leaseback arrangements. As a result, we expect future sale-leasebacks to be accounted for as a financial liability and the leased assets will be capitalized at cost. As all former sale-leasebacks have been accounted for as a sale, we did not reassess any former sale-leaseback transactions.\nWe adopted the new leasing standard using the Effective Date Approach, which allows entities to only apply the new lease standard in the year of adoption. We elected the available practical expedients for existing or expired contracts of lessees and lessors wherein the Company is not required to reassess whether such contracts contain leases, the lease classification or the initial direct costs. Additionally, we elected as accounting policies to not recognize right of use assets or lease liabilities for short-term leases (i.e. those with a term of 12 months or less) and to combine lease and non-lease components in the contract for both lessee and lessor arrangements.\nAdoption of this standard resulted in most of our operating lease commitments being recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets. Please see Note 18, Leases, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn April 10, 2020, the FASB issued a question-and-answer document that allows entities to elect not evaluate whether a concession provided by a lessor to a lessee in response to COVID-19 is a lease modification. An entity that makes this election may then elect to apply the lease modification guidance to that relief or account for the concession as if it were contemplated in the existing contract.\nOn April 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2017-08, Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Cost (Subtopic 310-20), Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities. These amendments shorten the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium. Specifically, the amendments require the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. The amendments do not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount; the discount continues to be amortized to maturity. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d). This standard requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses held at amortized cost. This new standard requires the use of forward-looking information to estimate credit losses and requires credit losses for available for sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than a reduction in the amortized cost basis. This update is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. In November 2019, the FASB released ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, which clarified narrow issues within ASU 2016-13. Specifically, the four main clarifications include: expected recoveries for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration; transition relief for troubled debt restructurings; disclosures for accrued interest receivables; and financial assets backed by collateral maintenance provisions.\nThe Company has completed the development of the implementation plan and is in the process of model development. The Company is evaluating whether ASU 2016-13 will have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB adopted ASU 2018-12, Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts (\u201cASU 2018-12\u201d). The amendments in this update require insurance companies to annually review and update the assumptions used for measuring the liability under long-duration contracts, such as life insurance, disability income, and annuities. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 31, 2020. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this amendment on our financial statements; however, the adoption of ASU 2018-12 will impact the statements of operations because the effect of any update to the assumptions we used at the inception of the contracts will be recorded in net income.\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) - Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASU 2018-13\u201d), which modifies the disclosures on fair value measurements by removing the requirement to disclose the amount and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the policy for the timing of such transfers. ASU 2018-13 expands the disclosure requirements for Level 3 fair value measurements, primarily focused on changes in unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income. ASU 2018-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of the standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General Subtopic 715-20 - Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans (\u201cASU 2018-14\u201d),\nwhich amends ASC 715 to add, remove, and clarify disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. ASU 2018-14 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (\u201cASU 2020-04\u201d). This standard provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the US GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Entities can elect not to apply certain modification accounting requirements to contracts affected by what the guidance calls reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met. An entity that makes this election would not have to remeasure the contracts at the modification date or reassess a previous accounting determination. The guidance is effective upon issuance and generally can be applied through December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating the impact of these standards on our consolidated financial statements.\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or the SEC that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, these ASUs entail technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance related to specialized industries or entities and therefore will have minimal, if any, impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption.\nNote 4.\nEarnings Per Share\nOur earnings per share is calculated by dividing our earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding, basic and diluted.\nThe weighted average common shares outstanding exclude post-1992 shares of the employee stock ownership plan that have not been committed to be released.

The gross realized gains on these sales totaled $\n6.4\nmillion, $\n2.0\nmillion and $\n5.4\nmillion in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We realized gross losses on these sales of $\n0.2\nmillion, $\n0.2\nmillion and $\n0.3\nmillion in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe unrealized losses of more than twelve months in the available-for-sale tables are considered temporary declines. We track each investment with an unrealized loss and evaluate them on an individual basis for other-than-temporary impairments, including obtaining corroborating opinions from third party sources, performing trend analysis and reviewing management\u2019s future plans. Certain of these investments may have declines determined by management to be other-than-temporary and we recognized these write-downs through earnings. There were no write downs in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nWe reviewed our available-for-sale investments at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and noted an increase in the unrealized loss position of $50.2 million (unaudited). We reviewed credit ratings of the issuers of these securities and determined that each issuer was current on its scheduled interest, dividends or principal payments. We further reviewed the fair value of these securities a month later and observed that the unrealized loss had recovered by $23.4 million (unaudited).\nThe investment portfolio primarily consists of corporate securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions. We believe we monitor our investments as appropriate. Our methodology of assessing other-than-temporary impairments is based on security-specific analysis as of the balance sheet date and considers various factors, including the length of time to maturity, the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost, the financial condition and the near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether the debtor is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments. Nothing has come to management\u2019s attention that would lead to the belief that any issuer would not have the ability to meet the remaining contractual obligations of the security, including payment at maturity. We have the ability and intent not to sell our fixed maturity and common stock investments for a period of time sufficient to allow us to recover our costs.\nThe portion of other-than-temporary impairment related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings. The significant inputs utilized in the evaluation of mortgage backed securities credit losses include ratings, delinquency rates, and prepayment activity. The significant inputs utilized in the evaluation of asset backed securities credit losses include the time frame for principal recovery and the subordination and value of the underlying collateral.\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nThere were no credit losses recognized in earnings for which a portion of an other-than-temporary impairment was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss for fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nThe adjusted cost and estimated market value of available-for-sale investments by contractual maturity, were as follows:\nMarch 31, 2020\nMarch 31, 2019\nAmortized\nCost\nEstimated\nMarket\nValue\nAmortized\nCost\nEstimated\nMarket\nValue\n(In thousands)\nDue in one year or less\n$\n128,747\n$\n129,420\n$\n71,987\n$\n71,954\nDue after one year through five years\n547,821\n566,934\n541,195\n540,658\nDue after five years through ten years\n636,036\n678,636\n621,031\n614,485\nDue after ten years\n832,334\n897,371\n845,052\n834,769\n2,144,938\n2,272,361\n2,079,265\n2,061,866\nMortgage backed securities\n187,784\n193,687\n148,203\n147,895\nRedeemable preferred stocks\n1,493\n1,565\n1,493\n1,468\n$\n2,334,215\n$\n2,467,613\n$\n2,228,961\n$\n2,211,229\nAs of March 31, 2018, equity investments were classified as available-for-sale on our balance sheet.

In accordance with the new leasing guidance, we assess if sale-leaseback transactions qualify as a sale at initiation by determining if a transfer of ownership occurs.\nWe have determined that our equipment sale-leasebacks do not qualify as a sale, as the buyer-lessors do not obtain control of the assets in our ongoing sale-leaseback arrangements. As a result, we expect future sale-leasebacks to be accounted for as a financial liability and the leased assets will be capitalized at cost.\nOur finance liabilities have an average term of seven (7) years and interest rates ranging from\n2.63\n% to\n4.22\n%. These finance liabilities are collateralized by our rental fleet.\nOther Obligations\nIn February 2011, AMERCO and U.S. Bank, NA (the \u201cTrustee\u201d) entered into the U-Haul Investors Club \u00ae Indenture.\nAMERCO and the Trustee entered into this indenture to provide for the issuance of notes by us directly to investors over our proprietary website, uhaulinvestorsclub.com (\u201cU-Notes \u00ae \u201d). The U-Notes \u00ae are secured by various types of collateral including, but not limited to, rental equipment and real estate.\nU-Notes \u00ae are issued in smaller series that vary as to principal amount, interest rate and maturity.\nU-Notes \u00ae are obligations of the Company and secured by the associated collateral; they are not guaranteed by any of the Company\u2019s affiliates or subsidiaries.\nAs of March 31, 2020, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the U-Notes \u00ae issued was $\n87.3\nmillion, of which $\n2.8\nmillion is held by our insurance subsidiaries and eliminated in consolidation. Interest rates range between\n2.50\n% and\n8.00\n% and maturity dates range between\nand\n.\nOxford is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) and, as such, the FHLB has made advances to Oxford. As of December 31, 2019, the advances had an aggregate balance of $\n60.0\nmillion, for which Oxford pays fixed interest rates between\n1.72\n% and\n2.95\n% with maturities between March 30, 2020 and September 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2019, available-for-sale investments held with the FHLB totaled $\n117.9\nmillion, of which $\n67.6\nmillion were pledged as collateral to secure the outstanding advances. The balances of these advances are included within Liabilities from investment contracts on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAnnual Maturities of Notes, Loans and Finance/Capital Leases Payable\nThe annual maturities of our notes, loans and finance/capital leases payable as of March 31, 2020 for the next five years and thereafter are as follows:\nYears Ended March 31,\nThereafter\nTotal\n(In thousands)\nNotes, loans and finance/capital leases payable, secured\n$\n459,184\n$\n510,933\n$\n1,011,688\n$\n755,025\n$\n393,498\n$\n1,520,740\n$\n4,651,068\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nNote 10.\nInterest on Borrowings\nInterest Expense\nComponents of interest expense include the following:\nYears Ended March 31,\n(In thousands)\nInterest expense\n$\n180,444\n$\n150,609\n$\n125,412\nCapitalized interest\n(23,517)\n(12,733)\n(6,466)\nAmortization of transaction costs\n4,427\n3,745\n3,867\nInterest expense resulting from cash flow hedges\n(404)\n3,893\nTotal interest expense\n160,950\n142,445\n126,706\nInterest paid in cash, including payments related to derivative contracts, amounted to $\n168.1\nmillion, $\n149.8\nmillion and $\n129.3\nmillion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nInterest Rates\nInterest rates and our revolving credit borrowings were as follows:\nRevolving Credit Activity\nYears Ended March 31,\n(In thousands, except interest rates)\nWeighted average interest rate during the year\n3.31\n%\n3.39\n%\n2.48\n%\nInterest rate at year end\n2.86\n%\n3.60\n%\n2.84\n%\nMaximum amount outstanding during the year\n$\n1,086,000\n$\n959,400\n$\n538,000\nAverage amount outstanding during the year\n$\n1,002,081\n$\n699,415\n$\n517,997\nFacility fees\n$\n$\n$\nNote 11.\nDerivatives\nWe manage exposure to changes in market interest rates. Our use of derivative instruments is limited to highly effective interest rate swaps to hedge the risk of changes in cash flows (future interest payments) attributable to changes in LIBOR swap rates, with the designated benchmark interest rate being hedged on certain of our LIBOR indexed variable rate debt and a variable rate operating lease. The interest rate swaps effectively fix our interest payments on certain LIBOR indexed variable rate debt. We monitor our positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and do not currently anticipate non-performance by the counterparties. Interest rate swap agreements are not entered into for trading purposes. These fair values are determined using pricing valuation models which include broker quotes for which significant inputs are observable. They include adjustments for counterparty credit quality and other deal-specific factors, where appropriate and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe derivative fair values reflected in prepaid expense and accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet were as follows:\nMarch 31, 2020\nMarch 31, 2019\n(In thousands)\nInterest rate contracts designated as hedging instruments\nAssets\n$\n-\n$\nLiabilities\n8,214\n-\nNotional amount (debt)\n235,000\n22,792\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nThe Effect of Interest Rate\nContracts on the Statements of Operations\nYears Ended March 31,\n(In thousands)\n(Gain) loss recognized in AOCI on interest rate contracts\n$\n8,356\n$\n(633)\n$\n(4,445)\n(Gain) loss reclassified from AOCI into income\n$\n(401)\n$\n$\n3,893\nGains or losses recognized in income on derivatives are recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, we recognized a decrease in the fair value of our cash flow hedges of $ 6.3 million, net of taxes.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, we reclassified $\n0.4\nmillion from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\u201cAOCI\u201d) to interest expense.\nAs of March, 31 2020, we expect to reclassify $\n0.4\nmillion of net gains on interest contracts from AOCI to earnings as interest expense over the next twelve months.\nWe use derivatives to hedge our equity market exposure to indexed annuity products sold by our Life Insurance company. These contracts earn a return for the contractholder based on the change in the value of the S&P 500 index between annual index point dates. We buy and sell listed equity and index call options and call option spreads. The credit risk is with the party in which the options are written. The net option price is paid up front and there are no additional cash requirements or additional contingent liabilities. These contracts are held at fair market value on our balance sheet. At March 31, 2020 and 2019, these derivative hedges had a net market value of $\n5.9\nmillion and $\n1.5\nmillion, with notional amounts of $\n246.8\nmillion and $\n284.0\nmillion, respectively. These derivative instruments are included in Investments, other; on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of these call options are determined based on quoted market prices from the relevant exchange and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\nAlthough the call options are employed to be effective hedges against our policyholder obligations from an economic standpoint, they do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under GAAP. Accordingly, the call options are marked to fair value on each reporting date with the change in fair value, plus or minus, included as a component of net investment and interest income. The change in fair value of the call options include the gains or losses recognized at the expiration of the option term and the changes in fair value for open contracts.\nNote 12.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nA summary of our AOCI components, net of tax, were as follows:\nForeign Currency Translation\nUnrealized Net Gain on Investments\nFair Market Value of Cash Flow Hedges\nPostretirement Benefit Obligation Net Loss\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n(In thousands)\nBalance as of March 31, 2019\n$\n(56,612)\n$\n(7,259)\n$\n$\n(2,934)\n$\n(66,698)\nForeign currency translation\n9,377\n-\n-\n-\n9,377\nUnrealized net gain on investments\n-\n97,943\n-\n-\n97,943\nChange in fair value of cash flow hedges\n-\n-\n(6,301)\n-\n(6,301)\nAmounts reclassified into earnings on hedging activities\n-\n-\n(2)\n-\n(2)\nChange in post retirement benefit obligaiton\n-\n-\n-\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n9,377\n97,943\n(6,303)\n101,350\nBalance as of March 31, 2020\n$\n(47,235)\n$\n90,684\n$\n(6,196)\n$\n(2,601)\n$\n34,652\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nNote 13.

The Tax Reform Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and repealed the deferral of the phase three tax for life insurance companies. The blended statutory Federal Tax Rate for our full fiscal year 2018 was\n31.55\n%. As of December 22, 2018, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Reform Act. For fiscal year 2018, we recognized a benefit amount of $\n356.6\nmillion, which was included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations.\nFor fiscal year 2018, we re-measured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates they are expected to reverse in the future which is generally 21%.\nThe amount recorded related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax balance was a benefit of $\n371.5\nmillion for fiscal year 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company elected to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act in the amount of $\n8.7\nmillion from AOCI to retained earnings under ASU 2018-02. In addition, the Company has adopted the \"investment by investment\" approach as our accounting policy with regard to releasing disproportionate income tax effects from AOCI.\nFor fiscal year 2018, we calculated and recorded a one-time transition tax on earnings from foreign subsidiaries based on the post-1986 earnings and profits of our Canadian subsidiaries that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes.\nThe effect of this one-time transition tax liability for our foreign subsidiaries resulted in an increase in income tax expense of $\n10.7\nmillion for fiscal year 2018.\nNo additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to transition tax, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in these entities (i.e., basis difference in excess of that subject to the one-time transition tax) is not practicable.\nThe Tax Reform Act repeals the special rules with regard to distribution to shareholders from pre-1984 policyholders surplus account. This one-time tax was based on the balance of our pre-1984 policyholder surplus account. We reported the amount of our one-time tax liability for Phase Three Tax, resulting in an increase in income tax expense of $\n4.2\nmillion for fiscal year 2018.\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes by recognizing the tax benefit or expense from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company measures the tax benefits and expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nA reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning and end of the period are as follows:\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands)\nUnrecognized tax benefits beginning balance\n$\n37,201\n$\n35,739\nRevaluation based on change in after tax benefit\n-\n-\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\n1,887\nReductions for tax positions of prior years\n(7,606)\n(46)\nSettlements\n(5)\n(379)\nUnrecognized tax benefits ending balance\n$\n29,632\n$\n37,201\nWe recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense, and penalties as income tax expenses. At March 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of interest accrued on unrecognized tax benefits was $\n12.8\nmillion and $\n9.5\nmillion, net of tax. During the current year we recorded expense from interest in the amount of $\n3.3\nmillion, net of tax.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and Canadian jurisdictions. While the Company has ongoing audits in Canada and various state jurisdictions, there have been no proposed or anticipated adjustments that would materially impact the financial statements. With some exceptions, we are no longer subject to audit for years prior to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.\nNote 15.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nProfit Sharing Plans\nWe provide tax-qualified profit sharing retirement plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees and retirees in the United States and Canada. The plans are designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis and provide for annual discretionary employer contributions. Amounts to be contributed are determined by the President and Chairman of the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) of the Company under the delegation of authority from the Board, pursuant to the terms of the Profit Sharing Plan. No contributions were made to the profit sharing plan during fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nWe also provide an employee savings plan which allows participants to defer income under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\nESOP Plan\nWe sponsor an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\u201cESOP\u201d) that generally covers all employees with one year or more of service. The ESOP began as a leveraged plan where shares were pledged as collateral for its debt which was originally funded by U-Haul. We made annual contributions to the ESOP equal to the ESOP\u2019s debt service. As the debt was repaid, shares were released from collateral and allocated to active employees, based on the proportion of debt service paid in the year. ESOP shares were committed to be released monthly and ESOP compensation expense was recorded based on the current market price at the end of the month. These shares then become outstanding for the earnings per share computations.\nIn fiscal 2020 we delivered the plan and now contributions are made at the discretion of management with expense being recognized upon the decision to contribute.\nESOP compensation expense was $\n10.3\nmillion, $\n11.3\nmillion and $\n11.4\nmillion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nListed below is a summary of these financing arrangements as of fiscal year-end:\nOutstanding as of\nInterest Payments\nFinancing Date\nMarch 31, 2020\n(In thousands)\nJune, 1991\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\nJuly, 2009\n-\nFebruary, 2016\n-\nLeveraged contributions to the Plan Trust during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $\n5.6\nmillion, $\n1.0\nmillion and $\n1.0\nmillion, respectively.

The fair value of unreleased shares issued subsequent to December 31, 1992 is defined as the trading value of such shares as of March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019, respectively. During fiscal 2020, we released for allocation 16,558 leveraged shares and 13,989 non-leveraged shares. As of March 31, 2020, it is estimated there will be no shares committed to be released.\nPost Retirement and Post Employment Benefits\nWe provide a health reimbursement benefit to our eligible U.S. employees and their eligible dependents upon retirement from the Company. The retiree must have attained age sixty-five and earned twenty years of full-time service upon retirement to be awarded the health reimbursement benefit. The health reimbursement benefit is capped at a $\n20,000\nlifetime maximum per covered person. Reimbursements are coordinated with Medicare and any other medical policies in force.\nIn addition, retirees who have attained age sixty-five and earned at least twenty years of full-time service upon retirement from the Company are entitled to group term life insurance benefits. The life insurance benefit is $\n3,000\nplus $\nfor each year of employment over twenty years. The benefits are not funded, and claims are paid as they are incurred. We use a March 31 measurement date for our post retirement benefit disclosures.\nThe components of net periodic post retirement benefit cost were as follows:\nYears Ended March 31,\n(In thousands)\nService cost for benefits earned during the period\n$\n1,055\n$\n1,108\n$\n1,073\nOther components of net periodic benefit costs:\nInterest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit\nOther components\nTotal other components of net periodic benefit costs\n1,054\n1,013\nNet periodic postretirement benefit cost\n$\n2,109\n$\n2,121\n$\n2,000\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nThe fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 post retirement benefit liability included the following components:\nYears Ended March 31,\n(In thousands)\nBeginning of year\n$\n25,817\n$\n23,316\nService cost for benefits earned during the period\n1,055\n1,108\nInterest cost on accumulated post retirement benefit\nNet benefit payments and expense\n(93)\n(979)\nActuarial (gain) loss\n(240)\n1,429\nAccumulated postretirement benefit obligation\n27,503\n25,817\nCurrent liabilities\n1,151\n1,037\nNon-current liabilities\n26,352\n24,780\nTotal post retirement benefit liability recognized in statement of financial position\n27,503\n25,817\nComponents included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):\nUnrecognized net loss\n(3,447)\n(3,890)\nCumulative net periodic benefit cost (in excess of employer contribution)\n$\n24,056\n$\n21,927\nThe discount rate assumptions in computing the information above were as follows:\nYears Ended March 31,\n(In percentages)\nAccumulated postretirement benefit obligation\n3.37\n%\n3.83\n%\n3.98\n%\nIn December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 became law. Net periodic post retirement benefit cost above includes the effect of the subsidy. The discount rate represents the expected yield on a portfolio of high grade (AA to AAA rated or equivalent) fixed income investments with cash flow streams sufficient to satisfy benefit obligations under the plan when due. Fluctuations in the discount rate assumptions primarily reflect changes in U.S. interest rates. The assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of the end of fiscal 2020 was\n6.5\n% in the initial year and was projected to decline annually to an ultimate rate of\n4.5\n% in fiscal 2038. The assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation as of the end of fiscal 2019 (and used to measure the fiscal 2020 net periodic benefit cost) was\n6.9\n% in the initial year and was projected to decline annually to an ultimate rate of\n4.5\n% in fiscal 2038.\nIf the estimated health care cost trend rate assumptions were increased by one percent, the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation as of fiscal year-end would increase by $\nthousand and the total of the service cost and interest cost components would increase by $\nthousand. A decrease in the estimated health care cost trend rate assumption of one percent would decrease the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation as of fiscal year-end by $\nthousand and the total of the service cost and interest cost components would decrease by $\nthousand.\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nPost employment benefits provided by us, other than upon retirement, are not material.\nFuture net benefit payments are expected as follows:\nFuture Net Benefit Payments\n(In thousands)\nYear-ended:\n$\n1,151\n1,350\n1,547\n1,753\n1,965\n2026 through 2029\n11,581\nTotal\n$\n19,347\nNote 16.\nFair Value Measurements\nCertain assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are measured and classified based upon a three-tiered approach to valuation. Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for identical or similar financial instruments in markets that are not considered to be active, or similar financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means; and\nLevel 3 - Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and are unobservable. These reflect management\u2019s assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nA financial instrument\u2019s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nFair values of cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to the short period of time to maturity. Fair values of short-term investments, investments available-for-sale, long-term investments, mortgage loans and notes on real estate, and interest rate swap contracts are based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. Fair values of trade receivables approximate their recorded value.\nOur financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments, trade receivables, reinsurance recoverables and notes receivable. Limited credit risk exists on trade receivables due to the diversity of our customer base and their dispersion across broad geographic markets. We place our temporary cash investments with financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.\nWe have mortgage receivables, which potentially expose us to credit risk. The portfolio of notes is principally collateralized by self-storage facilities and commercial properties. We have not experienced any material losses related to the notes from individual or groups of notes in any particular industry or geographic area. The estimated fair values were determined using the discounted cash flow method and using interest rates currently offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings.\nThe carrying amount of long-term debt and short-term borrowings are estimated to approximate fair value as the actual interest rate is consistent with the rate estimated to be currently available for debt of similar term and remaining maturity.\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nOther investments including short-term investments are substantially current or bear reasonable interest rates. As a result, the carrying values of these financial instruments approximate fair value.\nThe carrying values and estimated fair values for the financial instruments stated above and their placement in the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nFair Value Hierarchy\nYear Ended March 31, 2020\nCarrying Value\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal Estimated Fair Value\n(In thousands)\nAssets\nReinsurance recoverables and trade receivables, net\n$\n186,672\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n186,672\n$\n186,672\nMortgage loans, net\n262,688\n-\n-\n262,688\n262,688\nOther investments\n97,685\n-\n-\n97,685\n97,685\nTotal\n$\n547,045\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n547,045\n$\n547,045\nLiabilities\nNotes, loans and finance/capital leases payable\n$\n4,651,068\n$\n-\n$\n4,651,068\n$\n-\n$\n4,342,308\nTotal\n$\n4,651,068\n$\n-\n$\n4,651,068\n$\n-\n$\n4,342,308\nFair Value Hierarchy\nYear Ended March 31, 2019\nCarrying Value\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal Estimated Fair Value\n(In thousands)\nAssets\nReinsurance recoverables and trade receivables, net\n$\n224,785\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n224,785\n$\n224,785\nMortgage loans, net\n225,829\n-\n-\n225,829\n225,829\nOther investments\n74,907\n-\n-\n74,907\n74,907\nTotal\n$\n525,521\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n525,521\n$\n525,521\nLiabilities\nNotes, loans and finance/capital leases payable\n$\n4,192,243\n-\n$\n4,192,243\n$\n-\n$\n4,192,243\nTotal\n$\n4,192,243\n$\n-\n$\n4,192,243\n$\n-\n$\n4,192,243\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nThe following tables represent the financial assets and liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the level within the fair value hierarchy.\nYear Ended March 31, 2020\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\n(In thousands)\nAssets\nShort-term investments\n$\n369,279\n$\n368,968\n$\n$\n-\nFixed maturities - available for sale\n2,466,048\n7,156\n2,458,731\nPreferred stock\n6,675\n6,675\n-\n-\nCommon stock\n20,015\n20,015\n-\n-\nDerivatives\n5,944\n5,944\n-\n-\nTotal\n$\n2,867,961\n$\n408,758\n$\n2,459,042\n$\nLiabilities\nDerivatives\n$\n8,214\n$\n-\n$\n8,214\n$\n-\nTotal\n$\n8,214\n$\n-\n$\n8,214\n$\n-\nYear Ended March 31, 2019\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\n(In thousands)\nAssets\nShort-term investments\n$\n463,847\n$\n463,599\n$\n$\n-\nFixed maturities - available for sale\n2,209,761\n7,327\n2,202,213\nPreferred stock\n8,257\n8,257\n-\n-\nCommon stock\n17,379\n17,379\n-\n-\nDerivatives\n1,607\n1,468\n-\nTotal\n$\n2,700,851\n$\n498,030\n$\n2,202,600\n$\nLiabilities\nDerivatives\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nTotal\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nThe fair value measurements of our assets using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) were $0.2 million and $0.3 million as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nNote 17.\nReinsurance and Policy Benefits and Losses, Claims and Loss Expenses Payable\nDuring their normal course of business, our insurance subsidiaries assume and cede reinsurance on both a coinsurance and a risk premium basis.

Additionally, in certain instances the policyholder liability for a particular line of business may not be deficient in the aggregate to trigger loss recognition, but the pattern of earnings may be such that profits are expected to be recognized in earlier years followed by losses in later years. In these situations, accounting standards require that an additional liability be recognized by an amount necessary to sufficiently offset the losses that would be recognized in later years. The Company has not recognized any reserves related to premium deficiencies in the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nTo the extent that a reinsurer is unable to meet its obligation under the related reinsurance agreements, Repwest would remain liable for the unpaid losses and loss expenses. Pursuant to certain of these agreements, Repwest holds letters of credit as of December 31, 2019 in the amount of $\n0.1\nmillion from re-insurers and has issued letters of credit in the amount of $\n1.9\nmillion in favor of certain ceding companies.\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nPolicy benefits and losses, claims and loss expenses payable for Property and Casualty Insurance were as follows:\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\nUnpaid losses and loss adjustment expense\n$\n209,127\n$\n228,970\nReinsurance losses payable\n1,214\nTotal\n$\n210,341\n$\n229,958\nActivity in the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for Property and Casualty Insurance is summarized as follows:\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\nBalance at January 1\n$\n228,970\n$\n233,554\n$\n244,400\nLess: reinsurance recoverable\n94,920\n94,490\n103,952\nNet balance at January 1\n134,050\n139,064\n140,448\nIncurred related to:\nCurrent year\n22,137\n19,579\n15,749\nPrior years\n(9,535)\n(5,365)\nTotal incurred\n12,602\n14,214\n15,982\nPaid related to:\nCurrent year\n7,366\n8,838\n8,969\nPrior years\n17,242\n10,390\n8,397\nTotal paid\n24,608\n19,228\n17,366\nNet balance at December 31\n122,044\n134,050\n139,064\nPlus: reinsurance recoverable\n87,083\n94,920\n94,490\nBalance at December 31\n$\n209,127\n$\n228,970\n$\n233,554\nPrior year incurred losses were impacted by favorable development on numerous Excess Workers Compensation claims.

Leases\nLessor\nWe have determined that revenues derived by providing self-moving equipment rentals, self-storage rentals and certain other revenues, including U-Box rentals, are within the scope of the accounting guidance contained in Topic 842. Our self-moving equipment rental related revenues have been accounted for under the revenue accounting standard Topic 606, until the adoption of Topic 842.\nFor the periods after April 1, 2019, we combined all lease and non-lease components of lease contracts for which the timing and pattern of transfer are the same and the lease component meets the classification of an operating lease, and account for them in accordance with Topic 842. The revenue streams accounted for in accordance with Topic 842 are recognized evenly over the period of rental. Please see Note 23, Revenue Recognition, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLessee\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases, which are comprised primarily of storage rental locations, are included in ROU assets - operating and operating lease liability in our consolidated balance sheet dated March 31, 2020. Finance leases, which are comprised primarily of rental equipment leases, are included in ROU assets - financing, net, and notes, loans and finance/capital leases payable, net in our consolidated balance sheet dated March 31, 2020.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at commencement date including the rate for a fully collateralized loan that can either be fully amortizing or financed with a residual at the end of the lease term, for a borrower with similar credit quality in order to determine the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease, which are included in the calculation of ROU assets when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally not accounted for separately. Additionally, for certain leases, we apply a portfolio approach to account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities as the leases are similar in nature and have nearly identical contract provisions.\nAdoption of this standard resulted in most of our operating lease commitments being recognized as operating lease liabilities and ROU assets, which increased total assets and total liabilities by approximately $\n105.4\nmillion related to property operating leases, as of April 1, 2019. In addition, we reclassified a net amount of $\n948.2\nmillion related to vehicle financing leases from property, plant, and equipment, net to ROU assets financing, net. During fiscal 2020, we recognized new operating leases and ROU assets of $\n20.2\nmillion.\nThe standard also changed the manner by which we account for our equipment sale/leaseback transactions.\nBased on our assessment, the lease transactions are classified as financing leases, and therefore the transactions do not qualify as a sale.\nPursuant to the guidance, new sale leaseback transactions that fail to qualify as a sale will be accounted for as a financial liability.\nPlease see Note 9, Borrowings, of the Notes to Consolidated Finanical Statements for additional information.\nThe following table shows the components of our right-of-use assets, net:\nAs of March 31, 2020\nFinance\nOperating\nTotal\n(In thousands)\nBuildings and improvements\n$\n-\n$\n125,547\n$\n125,547\nFurniture and equipment\n21,113\n-\n21,113\nRental trailers and other rental equipment\n116,072\n-\n116,072\nRental trucks\n1,738,081\n-\n1,738,081\nRight-of-use assets, gross\n1,875,266\n125,547\n2,000,813\nLess: Accumulated depreciation\n(794,913)\n(18,916)\n(813,829)\nRight-of-use assets, net\n$\n1,080,353\n$\n106,631\n$\n1,186,984\nFinance\nOperating\nWeighted average remaining lease term (years)\n4 Years\n14 Years\nWeighted average discount rate\n3.5\n%\n4.6\n%\nFor the last twelve months ended March 31, 2020, cash paid for leases included in our operating and financing cash flow activities were $\n25.9\nmillion and $307.8 million, respectively.\nThe components of lease costs, including leases of less than 12 months, were as follows:\nTwelve Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2020\n(In thousands)\nOperating lease costs\n$\n27,494\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of right-of-use assets\n$\n186,860\nInterest on lease liabilities\n30,901\nTotal finance lease cost\n$\n217,761\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nMaturities of lease liabilities were as follows:\nFinance leases\nOperating leases\nYear ending March 31,\n(In thousands)\n$\n218,424\n$\n23,782\n164,190\n22,001\n124,160\n21,238\n106,156\n20,616\n75,502\n9,701\nThereafter\n46,438\n64,806\nTotal lease payments\n734,870\n162,144\nLess: imputed interest\n-\n(55,701)\nPresent value of lease liabilities\n$\n734,870\n$\n106,443\nAs previously disclosed in our 2019 Annual Report o Form 10-K and under the previous lease accounting standard, our operating and ground lease commitments for leases having terms of more than one year were as follows:\nTotal\n(In thousands)\nYear-ended March 31:\n$\n20,852\n18,495\n16,750\n16,317\n15,736\nThereafter\n54,683\nTotal\n$\n142,833\nNote 19.\nContingencies\nCOVID-19\nIn late 2019, COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and governmental authorities around the world have implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These measures have adversely affected workforces, customers, consumer sentiment, economies and financial markets.\nDuring and subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company has been impacted by the spread of COVID-19. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company\u2019s business, operations and financial results will depend upon numerous evolving factors that the Company is not able to predict at this time, including among others: customer initiated changes in behavior, actions that have been and continue to be taken by governmental entities, our workforce may be negatively impacted disrupting our ability to serve customers, any new information that may emerge concerning the severity and duration of COVID-19 and the reaction of capital markets. For April the two most significant effects that we have experienced are an approximate\n% (unaudited) decline in self-moving equipment rental income along with a decrease of approximately $\n39.5\nmillion (unaudited) in proceeds from the sales of rental equipment compared to April 2019.\nThe decline in equipment rental revenue has been improving in May (unaudited).\nAlthough the Company cannot estimate the length or gravity of the impact of COVID-19 at this time, if the pandemic continues, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of future operations, financial position and liquidity in fiscal 2021.\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nCARES Act\nThe CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations, increased limitations on qualified charitable contributions, and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. We continue to examine the impact the CARES Act may have on our business. To date we have availed ourselves of the provisions related to deferring certain payroll taxes, carrybacks of net operating losses, and will utilize the technical corrections to tax deprecation methods.\nWe estimate that the net operating loss carrybacks combined with the depreciation adjustments for our fiscal 2020 federal income tax return will result in a refund of approximately $\nmillion, which are reflected in Prepaid expense. As refunds are received, they will reduce this amount. We have estimated and recorded the overall effects of the CARES Act and do not anticipate a material change. It is possible future legislation could reduce or delay our ability to carryback these losses.\nEnvironmental\nCompliance with environmental requirements of federal, state and local governments may significantly affect Real Estate\u2019s business operations. Among other things, these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances. Real Estate is aware of issues regarding hazardous substances on some of its properties. Real Estate regularly makes capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance with environmental laws and has put in place a remedial plan at each site where it believes such a plan is necessary. Since 1988, Real Estate has managed a testing and removal program for underground storage tanks.\nBased upon the information currently available to Real Estate, compliance with the environmental laws and its share of the costs of investigation and cleanup of known hazardous waste sites are not expected to result in a material adverse effect on AMERCO\u2019s financial position or results of operations.\nOther\nWe are named as a defendant in various other litigation and claims arising out of the normal course of business. In management\u2019s opinion, none of these other matters will have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nNote 20.\nRelated Party Transactions\nAs set forth in the Company\u2019s Audit Committee Charter and consistent with NASDAQ Listing Rules, our Audit Committee (the \u201cAudit Committee\u201d) reviews and maintains oversight over related party transactions which are required to be disclosed under the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) rules and regulations and in accordance with GAAP.

The terms of the leases are similar to the terms of leases for other properties owned by unrelated parties that are leased to us.\nAs of March 31, 2020, subsidiaries of Blackwater acted as U-Haul independent dealers. The financial and other terms of the dealership contracts with the aforementioned companies and their subsidiaries are substantially identical to the terms of those with our other independent dealers whereby commissions are paid by us based upon equipment rental revenues.\nThese agreements and notes with subsidiaries of Blackwater, excluding Dealer Agreements, provided revenues of $\n24.0\nmillion, expenses of $\n2.6\nmillion and cash flows of $\n21.5\nmillion during fiscal 2020. Revenues and commission expenses related to the Dealer Agreements were $\n293.6\nmillion and $\n62.1\nmillion, respectively for fiscal 2020.\nIn December 2019, Real Estate completed the sale of two office buildings to Oxford at cost for approximately $\n15.0\nmillion.

There are restrictions on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. Their ordinary dividends are limited to the lower of 10% of prior year statutory surplus or prior year net income. Any extraordinary dividend, loans or advances to us from the insurance subsidiaries must be approved by the domiciliary insurance commissioner. Any dividend in excess of the limit requires prior regulatory approval. The statutory surplus for Repwest at December 31, 2019 that could be distributed as ordinary dividends was $\n22.7\nmillion. The statutory surplus for Oxford at December 31, 2019 that could be distributed as ordinary dividends was $\n18.6\nmillion. Repwest paid a dividend of $\n21.6\nmillion to AMERCO during fiscal 2020. Repwest did not pay a dividend to AMERCO in fiscal 2019 or 2018. Oxford did not pay a dividend to AMERCO in fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018, respectively. Restricted net assets for our insurance subsidiaries were $\n98.5\nmillion and $\n130.2\nmillion as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nFor our insurance subsidiaries, statutory accounting principles (\u201cSAP\u201d) differ from GAAP primarily in that: (i) premiums from deferred annuities are recognized as revenue under SAP, while they are accounted for as liabilities from investment contracts under GAAP; (ii) policy acquisition costs are expensed as incurred under SAP, while they are deferred and amortized over the effective period of the related life insurance policies or the present value of actual and expected gross profits from annuity deposits; (iii) policy benefits and losses are established using different actuarial assumptions; and (iv) investments are valued on a different basis and valuation allowances attributable to investments are different. In addition, certain assets are not admitted under SAP and are charged directly to surplus.\nNote 22.\nFinancial Information by Geographic Area\nUnited States\nCanada\nConsolidated\n(All amounts are in thousands U.S. $'s)\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2020\nTotal revenues\n$\n3,797,849\n$\n181,019\n$\n3,978,868\nDepreciation and amortization, net of gains on disposal\n652,110\n15,414\n667,524\nInterest expense\n157,595\n3,355\n160,950\nPretax earnings\n372,687\n5,437\n378,124\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(65,842)\n1,918\n(63,924)\nIdentifiable assets\n13,016,942\n421,082\n13,438,024\nUnited States\nCanada\nConsolidated\n(All amounts are in thousands U.S. $'s)\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2019\nTotal revenues\n$\n3,597,285\n$\n171,422\n$\n3,768,707\nDepreciation and amortization, net of gains on disposal\n575,134\n7,421\n582,555\nInterest expense\n139,573\n2,872\n142,445\nPretax earnings\n466,175\n11,354\n477,529\nIncome tax expense\n103,578\n3,094\n106,672\nIdentifiable assets\n11,526,876\n364,837\n11,891,713\nUnited States\nCanada\nConsolidated\n(All amounts are in thousands U.S. $'s)\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2018\nTotal revenues\n$\n3,435,821\n$\n165,293\n$\n3,601,114\nDepreciation and amortization, net of gains on disposal\n363,826\n8,521\n372,347\nInterest expense\n123,777\n2,929\n126,706\nPretax earnings\n628,901\n8,712\n637,613\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(155,685)\n2,715\n(152,970)\nIdentifiable assets\n10,425,299\n322,123\n10,747,422\nF-\namerco and consolidated subsidiaries\nnotes to condensed consolidated financial statements - (continued)\nNote 22A.\nConsolidating Financial Information by Industry Segment\nAMERCO\u2019s three reportable segments are:\nMoving and Storage, comprised of AMERCO, U-Haul, and Real Estate and the subsidiaries of\nU-Haul and Real Estate;\nProperty and Casualty Insurance, comprised of Repwest and its subsidiaries and ARCOA; and\nLife Insurance, comprised of Oxford and its subsidiaries.\nManagement tracks revenues separately, but does not report any separate measure of the profitability for rental vehicles, rentals of self-storage spaces and sales of products that are required to be classified as a separate operating segment and accordingly does not present these as separate reportable segments.

The standard outlines a five-step model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The standard applies to all contracts with customers except for leases, insurance contracts, financial instruments, certain nonmonetary exchanges and certain guarantees. The standard also requires expanded disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. Due to insignificant changes in our revenue recognition pattern for applicable revenue streams as a result of the updated guidance, there was no cumulative effect recorded.\nAdditionally, we elected to use the practical expedient for contracts that begin and end within the same reporting period in applying the updated guidance to our applicable revenue streams. The adoption of the standard did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations, or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nWe enter into contracts that may include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of amounts collected from customers for taxes, such as sales tax, and remitted to the applicable taxing authorities. We account for a contract under Topic 606 when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For contracts scoped into this standard, revenue is recognized when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied by means of transferring goods or services to the customer as applicable to each revenue stream as discussed below.\nThere were no material contract assets or liabilities as of March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019.\nSales of self-moving and self-storage related products are recognized at the time that title passes and the customer accepts delivery. The performance obligations identified for this portfolio of contracts include moving and storage product sales, installation services and/or propane sales. Each of these performance obligations has an observable stand-alone selling price. We concluded that the performance obligations identified are satisfied at a point in time under Topic 606, which is consistent with the timing of our revenue recognition under legacy guidance. The basis for this conclusion is that the customer does not receive the product/propane or benefit from the installation services until the related performance obligation is satisfied. These products/services being provided have an alternative use as they are not customized and can be sold/provided to any customer. In addition, we only have the right to receive payment once the products have been transferred to the customer or the installation services have been completed. Although product sales have a right of return policy, our estimated obligation for future product returns is not material to the financial statements at this time.\nProperty management fees are recognized over the period that agreed-upon services are provided. The performance obligation for this portfolio of contracts is property management services, which represents a series of distinct days of service, each of which is comprised of activities that may vary from day to day. However, those tasks are activities to fulfill the property management services and are not separate promises in the contract. We determined that each increment of the promised service is distinct in accordance with paragraph 606-10-25-19. This is because the customer can benefit from each increment of service on its own and each increment of service is separately identifiable because no day of service significantly modifies or customizes another and no day of service significantly affects either the entity\u2019s ability to fulfill another day of service or the benefit to the customer of another day of service. As such, we concluded that the performance obligation is satisfied over time under Topic 606, which is consistent with the timing of our revenue recognition under legacy guidance for the Management Fee component of the compensation received in exchange for the service. Additionally, in certain contracts the Company has the ability to earn an incentive fee based on operational results. Historically, these fees have been recognized once fully determinable. Under Topic 606, we measure and recognize the progress toward completion of the performance obligation on a quarterly basis using the most likely amount method to determine an accrual for the incentive fee portion of the compensation received in exchange for the property management service. The variable consideration recognized is subject to constraints due to a range of possible consideration amounts based on actual operational results. The amount accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 did not have a material effect on our financial statements.\nOther revenue consists of numerous services or rentals, of which U-Box contracts and service fees from Moving Help are the main components. The performance obligations identified for U-Box contracts\nF-\nare fees for rental, storage and shipping of U-Box containers to a specified location, each of which are distinct. A contract may be partially within the scope of Topic and partially within the scope of other topics. The rental and storage obligations in U-Box contracts meet the definition of a lease in Topic 842, while the shipping obligation represents a contract with a customer accounted for under Topic 606. Therefore, we allocate the total transaction price between the performance obligations of storage fees and rental fees and the shipping fees on a standalone selling price basis. U-Box shipping fees are collected once the shipment is in transit. Shipping fees in U-Box contracts are set at the initiation of the contract based on the shipping origin and destination, and the performance obligation is satisfied over time under Topic 606, which is consistent with the timing of our revenue recognition under legacy guidance. U-Box shipping contracts span over a relatively short period of time, and the majority of these contracts begin and end within the same fiscal year. Moving Help services fees are recognized in accordance with Topic 606. Moving Help services are generated as we provide a neutral venue for the connection between the service provider and the customer for agreed upon services. We do not control the specified services provided by the service provider before that service is transferred to the customer.\nRevenue Recognized in Accordance withTopic 842/840\nThe Company\u2019s self-moving rental revenues meet the definition of a lease pursuant to the guidance in ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) because those substitution rights do not provide an economic benefit to the Company that would exceed the cost of exercising the right.\nTherefore, upon adoption of Topic 842 on April 1, 2019, self-rental contracts are being accounted for as leases. We combined all lease and non-lease components of lease contracts for which the timing and pattern of transfer are the same and the lease component meets the classification of an operating lease, and account for them in accordance with Topic 842. The revenue streams accounted for in accordance with Topic 842 are recognized evenly over the period of rental. We do not expect this change to result in a change in the timing and pattern of recognition of the related revenues due to the short-term nature of the self-moving rental contracts. Please see Note 18, Leases, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSelf-storage revenues are recognized as earned over the contract period based upon the number of paid storage contract days.\nWe lease portions of our operating properties to tenants under agreements that are classified as operating leases. We recognize the total minimum lease payments provided for under the leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Generally, under the terms of our leases, the majority of our rental expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, are recovered from our customers.\nThe following table summarizes the minimum lease payments due from our customers and operating property tenants on leases for the next five years and thereafter:\nYear Ended March 31,\nThereafter\n(In thousands)\nSelf-moving equipment rentals\n$\n2,139\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nProperty lease revenues\n20,715\n16,927\n13,250\n9,834\n7,102\n58,379\nTotal\n$\n22,854\n$\n16,927\n$\n13,250\n$\n9,834\n$\n7,102\n$\n58,379\nRevenue Recognized in Accordance with Other Topics\nTraditional life and Medicare supplement insurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the premium-paying periods of the contracts when due from the policyholders. For products where premiums are due over a significantly shorter duration than the period over which benefits are provided, such as our single premium whole life product, premiums are recognized when received and excess profits are deferred and recognized in relation to the insurance in force. Life insurance premiums are recognized in accordance with existing guidance in Topic 944 - Financial Services - Insurance.\nProperty and casualty insurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the policy periods. Interest and investment income are recognized as earned. Property and casualty premiums are recognized in accordance with existing guidance in Topic 944 - Financial Services - Insurance.\nF-\nNet investment and interest income has multiple components. Interest income from bonds and mortgage notes are recognized when earned. Dividends on common and preferred stocks are recognized on the ex-dividend dates. Realized gains and losses on the sale or exchange of investments are recognized at the trade date. Net investment and interest income was recognized in accordance with existing guidance in Topic 825 - Financial Instruments.\nIn the following tables, the revenue is disaggregated by timing of revenue recognition:\nYears Ended March 31,\n(In thousands)\nRevenues recognized over time\n$\n147,565\n$\n2,814,732\n$\n2,617,990\nRevenues recognized at a point in time\n309,804\n305,408\n301,152\nTotal revenues recognized under ASC 606\n457,369\n3,120,140\n2,919,142\nRevenues recognized under ASC 842 or 840\n3,182,902\n406,070\n353,924\nRevenues recognized under ASC 944\n200,768\n131,563\n217,575\nRevenues recognized under ASC 320\n137,829\n110,934\n110,473\nTotal revenues\n$\n3,978,868\n$\n3,768,707\n$\n3,601,114\nIn the above tables, the revenues recognized over time include self-moving equipment rentals, property management fees, the shipping fees associated with U-Box rentals and a portion of other revenues for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Whereas revenues recognized at a point in time include self-moving and self-storage products and service sales and a portion of other revenues. Self-moving equipment rentals are now in revenues recognized under ASC 842/840 as of April 1, 2019.\nWe recognized liabilities resulting from contracts with customers for self-moving equipment rentals, self-storage revenues, U-Box revenues and tenant revenue, in which the length of the contract goes beyond the reported period end, although rental periods of the equipment, storage and U-Box contract are generally short-term in nature. The timing of revenue recognition results in liabilities that are reflected in deferred income on the balance sheet.\nNote 24.\nSubsequent Events\nOur management has evaluated subsequent events occurring after March 31, 2020. We do not believe any other subsequent events have occurred that would require further disclosure or adjustment to our financial statements other than as stated below.\nIn April 2020, Oxford paid AMERCO a cash dividend of $\n18.6\nmillion.\nIn April 2020, we expanded our corporate revolver by an additional $\n50.0\nmillion and fully borrowed that as well. In May 2020, we entered into a one-year term loan totaling $\n200.0\nmillion at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus a\n2.00\n% margin. This loan is secured by the Company\u2019s claims for federal income tax refund, to further strengthen our liquidity position.\nF-\nSCHEDULE\nI\nCONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF AMERCO\nBALANCE SHEETS\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands)\nASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n294,528\n$\n428,950\nInvestment in subsidiaries\n2,758,509\n2,474,671\nRelated party assets\n1,734,358\n1,424,274\nOther assets\n502,064\n120,896\nTotal assets\n$\n5,289,459\n$\n4,448,791\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nLiabilities:\nOther liabilities\n$\n1,068,291\n$\n754,115\n1,068,291\n754,115\nStockholders' equity:\nPreferred stock\n-\n-\nCommon stock\n10,497\n10,497\nAdditional paid-in capital\n454,029\n453,536\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n35,100\n(68,459)\nRetained earnings:\nBeginning of period\n3,976,752\n3,635,351\nAdjustment for adoption of ASU 2016-01\n-\n9,724\nNet earnings\n442,048\n370,857\nDividends\n(19,608)\n(39,180)\nEnd of period\n4,399,192\n3,976,752\nCost of common shares in treasury\n(525,653)\n(525,653)\nCost of preferred shares in treasury\n(151,997)\n(151,997)\nTotal stockholders' equity\n4,221,168\n3,694,676\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity\n$\n5,289,459\n$\n4,448,791\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed financial statements.\nF-\nCONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF AMERCO\nSTATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nYears Ended March 31,\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nRevenues:\nNet interest income and other revenues\n$\n6,586\n$\n8,601\n$\n4,606\nExpenses:\nOperating expenses\n10,622\n8,840\n7,003\nOther expenses\nTotal expenses\n10,718\n8,933\n7,094\nEquity in earnings of subsidiaries\n205,940\n279,589\n681,786\nInterest income\n130,670\n112,649\n120,549\nPretax earnings\n332,478\n391,906\n799,847\nIncome tax benfefit (expense)\n109,570\n(21,049)\n(9,264)\nEarnings available to common shareholders\n$\n442,048\n$\n370,857\n$\n790,583\nBasic and diluted earnings per common share\n$\n22.55\n$\n18.93\n$\n40.36\nWeighted average common shares outstanding: Basic and diluted\n19,603,708\n19,592,048\n19,588,889\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed financial statements.\nCONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF AMERCO\nSTATEMENTS OF comprehensive income\nYears Ended March 31,\n(In thousands)\nNet earnings\n$\n442,048\n$\n370,857\n$\n790,583\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n101,350\n(62,075)\n37,873\nTotal comprehensive income\n$\n543,398\n$\n308,782\n$\n828,456\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed financial statements.\nF-\nCONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF AMERCO\nSTATEMENTS OF CASH FLOW\nYears Ended March 31,\n(In thousands)\nCash flows from operating activities:\nNet earnings\n$\n442,048\n$\n370,857\n$\n790,583\nChange in investments in subsidiaries\n(205,940)\n(279,589)\n(681,786)\nAdjustments to reconcile net earnings to cash provided by operations:\nDepreciation\nNet loss on sale of real and personal property\n-\n-\n-\nDeferred income taxes\n323,980\n112,434\n(182,358)\nNet change in other operating assets and liabilities:\nReinsurance recoverables and trade receivables\n-\n-\n-\nPrepaid expenses\n(381,190)\n(6,289)\n(36,516)\nOther assets\n(40)\nRelated party assets\n-\n-\n-\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n1,935\n2,260\nNet cash provided (used) by operating activities\n180,856\n199,634\n(109,731)\nCash flows from investing activities:\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment\n-\n(1)\n(1)\nProceeds of property, plant and equipment\n-\n-\n-\nNet cash used by investing activities\n-\n(1)\n(1)\nCash flows from financing activities:\nProceeds from (repayments) of intercompany loans\n(311,534)\n(196,382)\n250,214\nCommon stock dividends paid\n(29,404)\n(39,179)\n(29,380)\nNet contribution from related party\n21,600\n-\n-\nNet cash provided (used) by financing activities\n(319,338)\n(235,561)\n220,834\nEffects of exchange rate on cash\n4,060\n(4,331)\n(3,124)\nIncrease (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n(134,422)\n(40,259)\n107,978\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n428,950\n469,209\n361,231\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n$\n294,528\n$\n428,950\n$\n469,209\nIncome taxes paid, net of income taxes refunds received, amounted to $\n6.9\nmillion, $ 4.3 million and $ 68.7 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed financial statements.\nF-\nCONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF AMERCO\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nMarch 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\n1.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nAMERCO, a Nevada corporation, was incorporated in April, 1969, and is the holding Company for U-Haul International, Inc., Amerco Real Estate Company, Repwest Insurance Company and Oxford Life Insurance Company.
