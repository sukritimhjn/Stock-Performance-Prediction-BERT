    "item_1": "Item 1. BUSINESS.\nGeneral\nArt\u2019s-Way Manufacturing Co., Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d and the \u201cCompany\u201d), began operations as a farm equipment manufacturer in 1956. Since that time, we have become a worldwide manufacturer of agricultural equipment, specialized modular science buildings and steel cutting tools. Our principal manufacturing plant is located in Armstrong, Iowa.\nWe have organized our business into three operating segments. Management separately evaluates the financial results of each segment because each is a strategic business unit offering different products and requiring different technology and marketing strategies. Our Agricultural Products segment manufactures and distributes farm equipment under our own and private labels. Our Modular Buildings segment manufactures modular buildings for various uses, commonly animal containment and research laboratories, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Art\u2019s-Way Scientific, Inc., an Iowa corporation. Our Tools segment manufactures standard single point brazed carbide tipped tools as well as PCD (polycrystalline diamond) and CBN (cubic boron nitride) inserts and tools through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Ohio Metal Working Products/Art\u2019s Way, Inc., an Ohio corporation. For detailed financial information relating to segment reporting, see Note 16 \u201cSegment Information\u201d to our financial statements in \u201cItem 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\u201d of this report.\nInformation about Art\u2019s-Way can be found on our website, http://www.artsway-mfg.com/. We are not including the information on our corporate website as a part of or incorporating it by reference into this report. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). The Exchange Act requires us to file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. These materials may be obtained electronically by accessing the SEC\u2019s website at http://www.sec.gov.\nBusiness of Our Segments\nAgricultural Products\nOur Agricultural Products segment, which accounted for 58.4% of our net revenue in the 2020 fiscal year and 59.0% of our net revenue in the 2019 fiscal year, is located primarily in Armstrong, Iowa. This segment manufactures a variety of specialized farm machinery under our own label, including portable and stationary animal feed processing equipment and related attachments used to mill and mix feed grains into custom animal feed rations; a line of hay and forage equipment consisting of forage boxes, blowers, running gear, and dump boxes; a line of manure spreaders; sugar beet harvesting equipment; a line of land maintenance equipment and moldboard plows. We sell our labeled products through independent farm equipment dealers throughout the United States and Canada. In addition, we manufacture and supply silage blowers under original equipment manufacturer (\u201cOEM\u201d) agreements. Sales to our OEM customers accounted for 1% of our consolidated sales in the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years. We also provide after-market service parts that are available to keep our branded and OEM-produced equipment operating to the satisfaction of the end user of our products.\nModular Buildings\nOur Modular Buildings segment, which accounted for 31.2% of our net revenue in the 2020 fiscal year and 31.7% of our net revenue in the 2019 fiscal year, is located in Monona, Iowa. This segment produces, sells and leases modular buildings, which are custom-designed to meet the specific research needs of our customers. The buildings we commonly produce range from basic swine buildings to complex containment research laboratories. We plan to continue our focus on providing research facilities for academic research institutions, government research and diagnostic centers, public health institutions and private research and pharmaceutical companies, as those are our primary market sectors. We provide services from start to finish by designing, manufacturing, delivering and installing these facilities to meet customers\u2019 critical requirements. In addition to selling these facilities, we also offer a lease option to customers in need of temporary facilities.\nTools\nOur Tools segment, which is located in Canton, Ohio, accounted for 10.4% of our net revenue in the 2020 fiscal year and 9.3% of our net revenue in the 2019 fiscal year. This segment produces and sells standard single point brazed carbide tipped tools as well as PCD (polycrystalline diamond) and CBN (cubic boron nitride) inserts and tools and OEM specialty tools. The tools are used by manufacturers in various industries to cut and shape various parts, pipes, and fittings. The marketing of the tools is primarily through independent distributors supplying manufacturers with industrial tools and supplies. We plan to continue our focus on providing cutting tools to industries such as automotive, aerospace, oil and gas piping, and appliances.\nOur Principal Agricultural Products\nFrom our beginnings as a producer of portable grinder mixers, our Agricultural Products segment has grown through developing several new products and with our acquisitions. In 2012, we acquired the assets of Universal Harvester Co., Inc. (\u201cUHC\u201d) in Ames, Iowa and began selling reels for combines and swathers as UHC by Art\u2019s-Way. In 2020, we decided to stop producing UHC reels in order to focus on core products. Today, our Agricultural Products segment manufactures a wide array of products relating to feed processing, crop production, manure spreaders, hay and forage, tillage and land management, and sugar beet harvesting equipment. Our Agricultural Products segment also maintains a small volume of OEM work for the industry\u2019s leading manufacturers.\nGrinder mixer line. The grinder mixer line represents our original product line. Our founder, Arthur Luscombe, designed the original power take-off unit powered grinder-mixer prior to our inception. Grinder mixers are used to grind grain and mix in proteins for animal feed. They have several agricultural applications and are commonly used in livestock operations. Our grinder mixers have wide swing radiuses to allow users to reposition the discharge tube from one side of the tank to the other in one step. Our 6105 grinder mixer offers a 105-bushel tank with a 20-inch hammermill. Our 6140 grinder mixer is a medium sized product with a 140-bushel tank, a 20-inch hammermill, and an 8-inch discharge auger. Our 7165 grinder mixer has a large 165- bushel tank with a 26-inch hammermill featuring self-contained hydraulics and 10-inch discharge augers yielding the fastest unload times in the industry. Our 8215 grinder mixer features a 215-bushel tank, which is the largest in the industry. Our Cattle Maxx rollermill mixer products offer consistent feed grain rations for beef and dairy operations and are available in 105-bushel, 140-bushel, and 165-bushel capacities. We also offer the JR50 and JR75 grinder mixer models for smaller operations featuring 50- and 75-bushel mixing tanks, respectively.\nStationary feed grain processing line. We offer stationary hammermills and rollermills. Harvesting leaves various amounts of extraneous materials that must be removed through processing the seeds. Hammermills are aggressive pre-cleaners that are designed to remove appendages, awns, and other chaff from seeds by vigorously scraping the seed over and through the screen. The screen has holes that are big enough to let the seed pass through undamaged but are small enough to catch and remove the appendages. Our rollermills roll the feed grain to minimize dust, and they fracture the outside hull to release the digestive juices more rapidly. Rolling feed provides more palatable and digestible feed for use in animal feeding operations.\nLand management line. Land planes are used to ensure even distribution of rainfall or irrigation by eliminating water pockets, furrows, and implement scars in fields. Our land planes have a patented Art\u2019s-Way floating hitch design. We offer pull-type graders to help our customers perform many tasks such as maintaining terraces and waterways, leveling ground, cleaning ditches, and removing snow. The pull-type graders follow close to the back of a tractor for leveling uneven areas or for turning in smaller spaces.\nMoldboard plow line. The Art\u2019s-Way moldboard plows offer conservation tillage choices to match each customer\u2019s preference. Our moldboard plows are designed to slice and invert the soil to leave a rough surface exposed, and they are primarily used on clean-tilled cropland with high amounts of crop residue.\nSugar beet harvesting line. Our sugar beet defoliators and harvesters are innovative products in the industry due to our focus on continuous improvement, both in reaction to customer requests and in anticipation of our customers\u2019 needs. Our machines can harvest six, eight, or twelve rows at one time. We were the first manufacturer to introduce a larger, 12-row harvester. Our sugar beet defoliators cut and remove the leaves of the sugar beets without damaging them, and the leaf particles are then incorporated back into the soil. We also offer a sonar leveling axle to improve the harvesting capability of our beet equipment.\nHay and forage line. We offer highly productive hay and forage tools for the full range of producers. This product line includes high capacity forage boxes for transporting hay from the field with optional running gear to provide superior stability and tracking. We offer the highest capacity forage boxes on the market. High velocity, high volume forage blowers are able to fill the tallest silos with lower power requirements.\nManure spreaders line. We offer vertical beaters and rear discharge manure spreaders in pull-type and depending on demand may begin offering truck mount configurations. Our manure spreaders offer flared sides for increased capacity and a guillotine slop gate for accurate metering. Our products are ideal for spreading livestock manure, compost, and lime. We offer a scale system and a scale system with GPS for proper nutrient placement. These spreaders boast a heavy-duty and rugged design with one of the best spread patterns in the industry, allowing for efficient and consistent nutrient and land management.\nProduct Distribution and Markets\nWe distribute goods for our Agricultural Products segment primarily through a network of approximately 1,100 U.S. and Canadian independent dealers, as well as overseas dealers in the United Kingdom, Japan and Australia, whose customers require specialized agricultural machinery. We have sales representation in 48 states and seven Canadian provinces; however, many dealers sell only service parts for our products. Our dealers sell our products to various agricultural and commercial customers. We also maintain a local sales force in our Armstrong, Iowa facility to provide oversight services for our distribution network, communicate with end users, and recruit and train dealers on the uses of our products. Our local service parts staff is available to help customers and dealers with their service parts needs. Our Modular Buildings segment typically sells products customized to the end-user\u2019s requirements directly to the end-user. Our Tools segment distributes products through manufacturers\u2019 representatives, direct sales, and OEM sales channels.\nWe currently export products to nine foreign countries. We have been shipping grinder mixers abroad since 2006 and have exported portable rollermills and sugar beet harvesters as well. We continue to strengthen these relationships and intend to develop new international markets. Our international sales accounted for 3.4% of consolidated sales during the 2020 fiscal year compared to 5.0% in the 2019 fiscal year.\nBacklog. Our backlogs of orders vary on a daily basis. As of February 3, 2021, our Tools segment had approximately $340,000 of backlog compared to $252,00 from the same date in 2020. Our Modular Buildings segment had approximately of $1,226,000 of backlog as of February 3, 2021, compared to $4,675,000 on that date in 2020. Our Agricultural Products segment had a net backlog of approximately $6,363,000 as of February 3, 2021 compared to $3,532,000 on February 3, 2020. Our backlog is up in two of three segments providing optimism about economic conditions in the year ahead. We expect that our order backlogs will continue to fluctuate as orders are received, filled, or canceled, and, due to dealer discount arrangements we may enter into from time to time, these figures are not necessarily indicative of future revenue.\nRecent Product Developments\nDuring the 2020 fiscal year, development in our Agricultural Products segment consisted of several products. We designed an all new Art\u2019s Way forage box to replace our Miller Pro forage box line. The Art\u2019s Way forage box provides an improved look on the Miller Pro version and comes complete with in-cab controls, which is a feature that is scarce in this industry. We also developed a metered application system for our X-series manure spreader that will give our customers the analytical data they need to improve profitability and comply with stiffening EPA regulations. We also redesigned the Miller Pro high dump to include a weigh bar and improved the look and manufacturability through the plant. Lastly, we have begun development on our commercial forage box to make it more marketable in the future.\nOur Tools and Modular Buildings segments complete projects based on customer specifications and did not engage in specific product development during the 2020 fiscal year.\nCompetition\nIn addition to the competitive strengths of each of our segments described below, we believe our diversified revenue base, sales presence and customer base drawn from these three segments helps to provide protection against competitive factors in any one industry.\nAgricultural Products\nOur Agricultural Products segment competes in a highly competitive agricultural equipment industry. We compete with larger manufacturers and suppliers that have broader product offerings and significant resources at their disposal; however, we believe that our competitive strengths allow us to compete effectively in our market.\nManagement believes that grain and livestock producers, as well as those who provide services to grain and livestock operations, are the primary purchasers of agricultural equipment. Many factors influence a buyer\u2019s choice for agricultural equipment. Any one or all factors may be determinative, but they include brand loyalty, the relationship with dealers, product quality and performance, product innovation, product availability, parts and warranty programs, price, and customer service.\nWhile our larger competitors may have resources greater than ours, we believe we compete effectively in the farm equipment industry by serving smaller markets in specific product areas rather than directly competing with larger competitors across an extensive range of products. Our Agricultural Products segment caters to niche markets in the agricultural industry. We do not have a direct competitor that has the same product offerings that we do. Instead, each of our product lines competes with similar products of many other manufacturers. Some of our product lines face greater competition than others, but we believe that our products are competitively priced with greater diversity than most competitor product lines. Other companies produce feed processing equipment, sugar beet harvesting and defoliating equipment, grinders, and other products similar to ours; therefore, we focus on providing the best product available at a reasonable price. Overall, we believe our products are competitively priced with above average quality and performance, in a market where price, product performance, and quality are principal elements.\nIn addition, in order to capitalize on brand recognition for our Agricultural Products segment, we have numerous product lines produced under our labels and private labels, and we have made strategic acquisitions to strengthen our dealer base. We also provide aftermarket service parts which are available to keep our branded and OEM-produced equipment operating to the satisfaction of the customer. We sell products to customers in the United States and nine foreign countries through a network of approximately 1,100 independent dealers in the United States and Canada, as well as overseas dealers in the United Kingdom and Australia.\nWe believe that our competitive pricing, product quality and performance, network of worldwide and domestic distributors, and strong market share for many of our products allow us to compete effectively in the agricultural products market.\nModular Buildings\nWe expect continued competition from our Modular Buildings segment\u2019s existing competitors, which include conventional design/build firms, as well as competition from new entrants into the modular building market. To some extent, we believe barriers to entry in the modular building industry limit the competition we face in the industry. Barriers to entry in the market consist primarily of access to capital, access to a qualified labor pool, and the bidding process that accompanies many jobs in the health and education markets. Despite these barriers, manufacturers who have a skilled work force and adequate production facilities could adapt their manufacturing facilities to produce modular structures.\nWe believe the competitive strength of our Modular Buildings segment is our ability to design and produce high-tech modular buildings more quickly than conventional design/build firms. Conventional design/build construction may take two to five years, while our modular laboratories can be delivered in as little as six months. As one of the few companies in the industry to supply turnkey modular buildings and laboratories, we believe we provide high-quality buildings at reasonable prices that meet our customers\u2019 time, flexibility, and security expectations.\nTools\nWe expect competition in our Tools segment from offshore products that have gained market share over the last 20 years. Our greatest threat continues to be emerging technologies that replace the need for brazed tools. These competitive threats are countered by our ability to offer the widest range of standard carbide tipped brazed tool inventories to be found in North America. These inventories are strategically located in four warehouses across the United States, enabling our customers to receive product quickly with minimal shipping costs. Our ability to produce special, engineered, value-added products in volume with short lead times sets us apart from our competitors. This is most evident in certain segments of the pipe processing industry, where we have been able to establish and maintain market share despite efforts from companies significantly larger than ourselves. In 2019 we expanded our tool offering by entering into an OEM agreement with a specialty tool manufacturer.\nRaw Materials, Principal Suppliers, and Customers\nRaw materials for our various segments are acquired from domestic and foreign sources and normally are readily available. Currently, we purchase the lifter wheels used to manufacture our sugar beet harvesters from a supplier located in China. We also purchase manure spreader beaters from a supplier in Italy. However, these suppliers are not principal suppliers and there are alternative sources for these materials.\nWe have an OEM supplier agreement with Case New Holland (\u201cCNH\u201d) for our Agricultural Products segment. Under the OEM agreement, we have agreed to supply CNH\u2019s requirements for certain feed processing and service parts, primarily blowers, under CNH\u2019s label. The agreement has no minimum requirements and can be cancelled upon certain conditions. The initial term of the agreement with CNH expired in September 2006, but the agreement continues in force until terminated or cancelled by either party. Neither party has terminated or cancelled the agreement as of November 30, 2020. We also sold reels to Honey Bee and Agco under an OEM agreement. Reels will no longer be a part of our product offering going forward. For the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years, sales to OEM customers were approximately 1% of consolidated sales.\nWe do not typically rely on sales to one customer or a small group of customers. During the 2020 fiscal year, one customer accounted for more than 18% of consolidated revenues as the result of a large contract in our Modular Buildings segment. Our highest recurring customer accounted for just under 6% of our consolidated net revenues.\nIntellectual Property\nWe maintain manufacturing rights on several products, which cover unique aspects of design. We also have trademarks covering product identification. We believe our trademarks and licenses help us to retain existing business and secure new relationships with customers. The duration of these rights ranges from 5 to 10 years, with options for renewal. We currently have no pending applications for intellectual property rights.\nWe pay royalties for our use of certain manufacturing rights. Under our OEM supplier agreement with CNH, CNH sold us the license to manufacture, sell, and distribute certain plow products designed by CNH and their replacement and component parts. We pay semi-annual royalty payments based on the invoiced price of each licensed product and service part we sell. We have a licensing royalty agreement with Martin Harvesting, LLC to produce a commercial forage box in exchange for royalty payments in effect until August 2026. Our rights to manufacture and sell this product do not expire, but we will pay a royalty amount based on the sales price of each licensed product we sell. We also have a licensing and royalty agreement with Spreader, LLC to produce a loader mounted spreader in exchange for royalty payments until December 2027.\nGovernment Relationships and Regulations; Environmental Compliance\nOur Modular Buildings segment must design, manufacture, and install its modular buildings in accordance with state building codes, and we have been able to achieve the code standards in all instances. In addition, we are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations pertaining to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment. We do not expect that the cost of complying with these regulations will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nEmployees\nAs of November 30, 2020, we employed approximately 84 employees in our Agricultural Products segment, two of whom were employed on a part-time basis. As of the same date, we had 23 employees in our Tools segment, one of whom was employed on a part-time basis. The majority of the employees in our Tools segment are represented by a union and covered by a collective bargaining agreement. In addition, our Modular Buildings segment employed approximately 20 employees as of the same date, one of whom worked on a part-time basis. These numbers do not necessarily represent peak employment during the 2020 fiscal year.",

    "item_2": "Item 2. PROPERTIES.\nOur executive offices, as well as the primary production and warehousing facilities for our Agricultural Products segment, are located in Armstrong, Iowa. These facilities were constructed after 1965 and remain in fair condition. The facilities in Armstrong contain approximately 249,000 square feet of usable space. We have engaged in several building improvement projects during the last several years including most recently updating our office spaces in 2020. In addition, we own approximately 127 acres of land west of Armstrong, on which the factory and inventory storage space is situated for our Agricultural Products segment.\nWe completed construction in November 2007 of our facility in Monona, Iowa, which houses the manufacturing for our Modular Buildings segment. The facility was custom-designed to meet our production needs. It has approximately 50,000 square feet of useable space and accommodates a sprinkler system and crane.\nIn connection with the acquisition of certain assets of Ohio Metal Working Products Company in September 2013, we also purchased the land and building used for manufacturing of the products sold by Ohio Metal Working Products Company, located in Canton, Ohio. The building contains approximately 39,000 square feet of usable space and is in good condition. The purchased land is approximately 4.50 acres and is used by our Tools segment.\nAll of our owned real property is subject to mortgages granted to Bank Midwest as security for our long-term debt and our line of credit.

    "item_7": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion, which focuses on our results of operations, contains forward-looking information and statements. Actual events or results may differ materially from those indicated or anticipated, as discussed in the section entitled \u201cForward Looking Statements.\u201d The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should also be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes to financial statements contained in \u201cItem 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\u201d of this report.\nFinancial Condition\nOur 2020 fiscal year provided never before seen challenges as the world battled an ongoing pandemic and businesses everywhere suffered. We began the year with a strong first quarter in our Agricultural Products segment with our sales up 13% for the quarter compared to the prior year. In mid-March businesses began going into lockdown to try and slow the spread of COVID-19. Our sales suffered and we ended the second quarter with sales down approximately 4% year to date compared to the prior year. We were not able to recover and ultimately ended the year with our sales down 3% in our Agricultural Products segment compared to the prior year. Despite these dire market conditions, we did continue to improve operational efficiency as evidenced by improved labor efficiency rates. When measuring gross profit in our Agricultural Products segment, absent aged inventory scrap, we showed improvement of approximately 7% from fiscal 2019. Troubling market conditions over the last decade have forced us to adapt and improve our operations which gives us optimism about our ability to perform in times of economic boom. Our Modular Buildings segment struggled in fiscal 2020 mainly due to unexpected losses on a large construction contract. This segment also struggled to get new projects under contract as COVID-19 caused business disruption throughout the world. Our Tools segment suffered in the pandemic as oil and gas prices plummeted. The addition of an OEM customer in 2019 helped supplant the lost business from oil and gas customers in 2020.\nOur consolidated balance sheet indicates a stable financial position as of November 30, 2020 despite continued net losses. While fiscal 2020 brought a net loss of $2,103,000, we had approximately $1,000,000 of expense from non-cash inventory scrap as we continued to purge inventory from previous acquisitions. We also spent approximately $216,000 on pandemic expenses and $286,000 for the recruitment and training of key management positions. Our bottom lines have suffered in recent years as we have tried to streamline our operations by addressing prior year acquisitions that have not served us well in poor market conditions.\nWe expect to have access to capital as needed throughout fiscal 2021 through the sale of inventory and from the use our line of credit. On November 30, 2020 we had $2,640,470 available on our line of credit. In 2020, we were able to obtain $1,242,900 of funding from the Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program. These funds were fully forgiven in November 2020 and helped offset losses during the pandemic as we continued to employ our workforce in full. We also received three Economic Injury Disaster Loans for a total of $450,000. These loans have a 30 year payback period. Despite the continued losses, our banking relationship has remained positive through transparency and continued communication. Our ability to not overuse our line of credit in times of losses has provided us with the confidence that we can manage our cash use until market conditions improve and our product offering and dealer network grow. Our working capital remained strong at approximately $4,137,000 in fiscal 2020 with a current ratio of 1.67. We also continue to maintain a debt to equity ratio below 1. We continue to put emphasis on reducing our inventory to more manageable levels to decrease carrying costs, implementing lean manufacturing practices, improving our inventory turnover, focusing our product offering, increasing our dealer network reach, and improving customer service. We do not foresee liquidity issues within the next twelve months.\nImpact of COVID-19\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic had very little impact on our results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, it did impact our results of operations for the rest of fiscal 2020 and we believe that it may continue to do so for the foreseeable future. From March 23, 2020 until May 18, 2020 the majority of our office staff in all three segments worked remotely with the exception of key operations support. At the height of the initial outbreak our workforce was down approximately 17% due to self-quarantine. By the end of May 2020 our entire workforce had returned and operations have continued as normal with additional safety precautions in place. As COVID-19 cases began to rise in November 2020, we allowed employees that could perform their job functions remotely do so at their discretion. At this time approximately 75% of our office staff is working remote at least part-time and this has had minimal effect on how we operate as a business. We expect that by the end of February 2021 remote employees will return full time to the office. Future outbreaks could have a material effect on our operations and we are taking precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\nIn our Agricultural Products segment, we did not experience any order cancellations; however, calls for new whole goods slowed significantly in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and many dealers held off on the shipping or pickup of their completed units. Our sales levels were comparatively steady to the last few years in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 and we ultimately ended the year down 3.1% on sales. Prior to the initial lockdowns in March 2020, we were anticipating an uptick in sales from recent years. We believe 2021 will bring better economic conditions for farmers because of stimulus payments received in 2020. We also believe that farmers were conservative in 2020, using excess funds to pay down debt, and will be ready to spend in 2021.\nOur Modular Buildings segment started fiscal 2020 with a more diverse backlog than we had at the beginning of fiscal 2019; however, we had some setbacks on site work as subcontractors were forced to quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19. Our workers have been hesitant to travel during the pandemic and, as a result, we have had some challenges completing site work in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020. Because of COVID-19, many companies were hesitant to enter into long-term contracts in fiscal year 2020. As a result, our modular building rental fleet remained largely unused in fiscal 2020 which is evidenced by our decrease in lease revenue. Our sales outlook for fiscal 2021 reflects a continued decrease in demand, but sales activity saw a moderate increase near the end of fiscal 2020.\nIn our Tools segment, oil prices dropped significantly at the start of the pandemic, which caused our sales to drop significantly in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The diversification of our business with our new OEM customer helped us get through the oil and gas industry lows during that time; however, since oil and gas prices have not yet reached their pre-pandemic levels, we have not seen our sales levels from these customers return. We are optimistic that we have passed the low point in our Tools segment and expect improved sales in fiscal 2021.\nWhile our sales were affected in fiscal 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic, government programs including the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan program helped protect our liquidity that may have otherwise been materially impacted. However, the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material impact on our operations in the future as suppliers lose access to labor and resources which could ultimately drive up prices. We are not currently able to measure this impact and at this time believe our operations will continue as normal. Travel restrictions and border closures have not had a major impact on our ability to operate and achieve business goals. While we did minimize our travel in 2020 our operations were not materially affected by the inability to travel. Many trade shows shifted to online and some canceled altogether, however, our sales volumes were not significantly affected by the cancellation of these shows. As vaccinations occur in 2021, we expect travel and trade show participation to pick up. While we are short of our pre-pandemic expectations, we believe the worst of the economic hardship has passed for us. We have built and improved our business over the last few years to help us better weather any economic storms that come our way.\nCEO Transition\nAs previously announced, David King took over for Carrie Gunnerson as our Chief Executive Officer in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Carrie Gunnerson\u2019s final day as our Chief Executive Officer was July 21, 2020. Mr. King previously served as our Executive Vice President since March 30, 2020. Mr. King brings 25 years of agriculture industry experience in operations, marketing and business development. We look forward to Mr. King bringing Art\u2019s Way new strategic business opportunities and providing a revitalized brand image.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our financial statements in \u201cItem 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\u201d of this report. Critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nWe believe that the following represents the most critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and cost is determined using the standard costing method. Management monitors the carrying value of inventories using inventory control and review processes that include, but are not limited to, sales forecast review, inventory status reports, and inventory reduction programs. We record inventory write downs to net realizable value based on expected usage information for raw materials and historical selling trends for finished goods. If the assumptions made by management do not occur, we may need to record additional write downs.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn accordance with ASC 606, revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and recognized when we satisfy the performance obligation specified in each contract.\nOur revenues primarily result from contracts with customers. The major sources of revenue for the Agricultural Products and Tools segments are farm equipment, service parts related to farm equipment and steel cutting tools and inserts. The Agricultural Products and Tools segments generally execute short-term contracts that contain a single performance obligation - the delivery of product to the common carrier. We recognize revenue for the production and sale of farm equipment, service parts and cutting tools upon shipment of the goods. Shipment of the goods is the point in time when risk of ownership and title pass to the customer. The Tools segment has an OEM agreement with one customer for which sales are recognized FOB destination - when the goods hit the customer\u2019s dock. All sales are made to authorized dealers whose application for dealer status has been approved and who have been informed of general sales policies. Any changes in our terms are documented in the most recently published price lists. Pricing is fixed and determinable according to our published equipment and parts price lists. Title to all equipment and parts sold pass to the customer upon delivery to the carrier and is not subject to a customer acceptance provision. Proof of the passing of title is documented by the signing of the delivery receipt by a representative of the carrier. Post shipment obligations are limited to any claim with respect to the condition of the equipment or parts. The Agricultural Products and Tools segments each typically require payment in full 30 days after the ship date. To take advantage of program discounts, some customers pay deposits up front. Any deposits received are considered unearned revenue and increase contract liabilities.\nIn certain circumstances, upon the customer\u2019s written request, we may recognize revenue when production is complete, and the goods are ready for shipment. At the customer\u2019s request, we will bill the customer upon completing all performance obligations, but before shipment. The customer dictates that we ship the goods per their direction from our manufacturing facility, as is customary with this type of agreement, in order to minimize shipping costs. The written agreement with the customer specifies that the goods will be delivered on a schedule to be determined by the customer, with a final specified delivery date, and that we will segregate the goods from our inventory, such that they are not available to fill other orders. This agreement also specifies that the customer is required to purchase all goods manufactured under this agreement. Title of the goods will pass to the customer when the goods are complete and ready for shipment, per the customer agreement. At the transfer of title, all risks of ownership have passed to the customer, and the customer agrees to maintain insurance on the manufactured items that have not yet been shipped. We have operated using bill and hold agreements with certain customers for many years, with consistent satisfactory results for both the customers and us. The credit terms on this agreement are consistent with the credit terms on all other sales. All risks of loss are shouldered by the customer, and there are no exceptions to the customer\u2019s commitment to accept and pay for these manufactured goods. Revenues recognized at the completion of production in fiscal 2020 and 2019 were approximately $0 and $16,000, respectively.\nThe Modular Buildings segment is in the construction industry with its major source of revenue arising from modular building sales. Sales of modular buildings are generally recognized using input methods to measure progress towards the satisfaction of a performance obligation using the percentage of completion method. Revenue and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Contract costs consist of direct costs on contracts, including labor, materials, and amounts payable to subcontractors and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as equipment costs, insurance and employee benefits. Contract cost is recorded as incurred, and revisions in contract revenues and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Contract losses are recognized when current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost indicate a loss. Estimated contract costs include any and all costs appropriately allocable to the contract. The provision for these contract losses will be the excess of estimated contract costs over estimated contract revenues. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract change orders, penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. We use significant judgements in determining estimated contract costs and completion percentages throughout the life of the project. Stock modular building sales also occur and are recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation is fulfilled through substantial completion. Substantial completion is achieved through customer acceptance of the completed building. The Modular Buildings segment executes contracts with customers that can be short- or long-term in nature. These contracts can have multiple performance obligations and revenue from these can be recognized over time or at a point in time depending on the nature of the contracts. Payment terms for the Modular Buildings segment vary by contract, but typically utilize money down and progress payments throughout the life of the contract. The payment terms of the Modular Buildings segment have the most impact on our contract receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities. Project invoicing from the Modular Buildings segment increases contract receivables and has an effect on contract liabilities through billings in excess of costs and estimated gross profit and advanced payments. The balance of contract assets is typically made up of the balance of costs and estimated gross profit in excess of billings. Costs and profit in excess of amounts billed are classified as current assets and billings in excess of cost and profit are classified as current liabilities.\nWe also lease modular buildings to certain customers and account for these transactions as operating or sales-type leases. These leases have terms of up to 36 months and are collateralized by a security interest in the related modular building. On sales-type leases, the lessee has a bargain purchase option available at the end of the lease term. A minimum lease receivable is recorded net of unearned interest income and profit on sale at the time the building is substantially complete. Profit related to the sale of the building is recorded upon fulfillment of our obligation to the lessee. On operating leases, we recognize rent when the lessee has all the rights and benefits of ownership of the asset.\nThe Agricultural Products segment offers variable consideration in the form of discounts depending on participation in yearly early order programs. This variable consideration is allocated to the transaction price of all products in a sales arrangement and is not contingent on future outcomes. The Agricultural Products segment does not offer rebates or credits. The Tools segment offers quantity discounts that are allocated to the transaction price of each product once the quantity break is achieved. The Tools segment does not offer rebates or credits. The Modular Buildings segment does not offer discounts, rebates or credits.\nOur returns policy allows for new and saleable parts to be returned, subject to inspection and a restocking charge, which is included in net sales. Whole goods are not returnable. Shipping costs charged to customers are included in net sales. Freight costs incurred are included in cost of goods sold. Customer deposits consist of advance payments from customers, in the form of cash, for revenue to be recognized in the following year.\nFor information on product warranty as it applies to ASC 606, refer to Note 8 \u201cProduct Warranty\u201d contained in our financial statements in \u201cItem 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\u201d of this report.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended November 30, 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended November 30, 2019\nOur consolidated net sales totaled $22,409,000 for the 2020 fiscal year, which represents a 2.1% decrease from our consolidated net sales of $22,889,000 for the 2019 fiscal year. The decrease in revenue is due to decreases in sales in our Modular Building and Agricultural Products segments. Our Tools segment reported a 9.9% increase in sales compared to the 2019 fiscal year. Our consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 10.7% in the 2020 fiscal year when compared to 17.2% of net sales in the 2019 fiscal year. We saw decreased gross profit percentage in all three segments in fiscal 2020 due to varying circumstances discussed below. Our consolidated operating expenses increased by 16.3%, from $5,424,000 in the 2019 fiscal year to $6,309,000 in the 2020 fiscal year. Because the majority of our corporate general and administrative expenses are borne by our Agricultural Products segment, that segment represented $4,483,000 of our total consolidated operating expenses, while our Modular Buildings segment represented $1,034,000 and our Tools segment represented $792,000.\nOur consolidated operating loss for the 2020 fiscal year was $(3,910,000) compared to $(1,497,000) for the 2019 fiscal year. Our Agricultural Products segment had an operating loss of $(2,318,000), our Modular Buildings segment had operating loss of $(1,295,000) and our Tools segment had an operating loss of $(297,000).\nConsolidated net loss for the 2020 fiscal year was $(2,103,000) compared to net loss of $(1,420,000) in the 2019 fiscal year, an increase in loss of $683,000.\nOur effective tax rate for the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years was 28.9% and 19.7%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is due to the tax treatment of Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness as discussed in Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our financial statements in \u201cItem 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\u201d of this report.\nAgricultural Products. Our Agricultural Products segment\u2019s net sales for the 2020 fiscal year were $13,085,000 compared to $13,508,000 during the 2019 fiscal year, a decrease of $423,000, or 3.1%. The decrease in sales can be primarily explained by a decrease in sales of our UHC reels year over year. In mid fiscal 2019, we lost our primary reel customer over disagreements on price, as we determined that the margins on reels weren\u2019t enough to justify putting them into our production schedule and were only willing to produce them for an increased price. We expect further declines in our reel revenue as we discontinue production of this line and replace the production slots with products that provide us with greater margin. We also saw decreased demand for our beet equipment and forage and receiver boxes in the 2020 fiscal year compared to the 2019 fiscal year. We expect increased demand for these lines in fiscal 2021 as our backlog indicates we will have improved sales of beet equipment and we will be launching a new Art\u2019s Way forage box. Sales of manure spreaders, dump boxes and grinders improved in fiscal 2020 over fiscal 2019. The improved success of these lines provides optimism for the future as we believe these are the core products we can market towards future growth.\nGross profit percentage for the 2020 fiscal year was 16.5% compared to 16.3% for the 2019 fiscal year. We attribute the increase in gross profit to a 4% improvement on standard gross profit margin due to favorable product mix and fewer liquidation sales in fiscal 2020. We also saw a 5% increase in our measurable labor efficiency metric, which tells us how productive our workforce is. After eliminating $996,000 of inventory obsolescence expense in fiscal 2020 and $315,000 of the same expense in fiscal 2019 we had an increase in gross profit percent of approximately 7% year over year. We believe that presenting gross profit percentage excluding inventory obsolescence expense is useful because it excludes a significant expense that we do not expect to continue to occur going forward and therefore facilitates a better comparison of gross profit percentage over multiple periods and is a clearer reflection of our ongoing operations. The $996,000 of inventory obsolescence expense in fiscal 2020 was related to increasing reserves on product lines we eliminated strategically from our offering including UHC reels, Miller Pro forage boxes, rakes and augers. Our core product offering going forward includes products that we feel have strong demand, favorable margins and flow through our facility efficiently. We believe the gross margin improvements are a strong indicator of our ability to succeed as agricultural conditions continue to improve.\nOur Agricultural Products segment\u2019s operating expenses for the 2020 fiscal year were $4,483,000 compared to $3,796,000 for the 2019 fiscal year, an increase of $687,000, or 18.1%. Approximately $115,000 of this increase is due to the hiring of a new territory development manager to increase sales and strengthen our dealer network. We also incurred $116,000 of additional recruitment expense in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 related to hiring a new CEO, supply chain manager and product manager. We incurred approximately $73,000 of expense paying dual salaries as we transitioned these new roles. We also incurred approximately $148,000 of pandemic expense as we increased employee incentives for working during the pandemic, conducted sitewide COVID-19 testing and provided supplies to help keep our employees safe. We also incurred approximately $300,000 of additional bonus expense in fiscal 2020 recruiting new management talent, rewarding retiring management, and accruing bonuses for operational improvements during this agricultural downturn. This segment\u2019s operating expenses for the 2020 fiscal year were 34.3% of sales compared to 28.1% of sales for the 2019 fiscal year. Total loss from operations for our Agricultural Products segment during the 2020 fiscal year was $(2,318,000) compared to an operating loss of $(1,599,000) for the 2019 fiscal year, an increase in loss of $719,000.\nModular Buildings. Our Modular Buildings segment\u2019s net sales for the 2020 fiscal year were $6,993,000 compared to $7,260,000 for the 2019 fiscal year, a decrease of $267,000, or 3.7%. The decrease in sales was attributable to decreased operating lease activity in fiscal 2020 and a large construction project nearing completion. Gross profit for the 2020 fiscal year was (3.7)% compared to 16.1% during the 2019 fiscal year. The decreased gross profit was due to margin deterioration on a large construction contract for expenses that were unforeseen. Operating expenses for the 2020 fiscal year were 14.8% of sales compared to 13.3% for the 2019 fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses was due to $35,000 of pandemic expense related to employee incentives during COVID-19 lockdowns and supplies needed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Total loss from operations from our Modular Buildings segment during the 2020 fiscal year was $(1,295,000) compared to an operating income of $208,000 in the 2019 fiscal year, an increase in loss of $1,503,000. Our expected profits on a large construction project eroded in fiscal 2020, but we look forward to a fresh start in fiscal 2021.\nTools. Our Tools segment\u2019s net sales for the 2020 fiscal year were $2,330,000 compared to $2,121,000 for the 2019 fiscal year, an increase of $209,000, or 9.9%. The increase is primarily due to the addition of a large OEM customer in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. We had projected larger revenue increases; however, the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on our existing customer base, mainly the oil and gas industries. These sales have not fully recovered to date and we have relied heavily on our OEM customer in recent months. We are focused on expanding our portfolio of customers to help us diversify our business as different industries experience booms and busts. Gross profit for the 2020 fiscal year was 21.3% compared to 26.4% for the 2019 fiscal year. Our decreased gross margin for the twelve months is attributable to the hiring of a floor supervisor to help us manage the higher volumes of sales we were expecting with the addition of our OEM customer. This position is a necessary one to manage increased volumes through our shop floor and we are continuing to find ways to increase volumes to cover the expenses of this position. Operating expenses were $792,000 for the 2020 fiscal year compared to $666,000 for the 2019 fiscal year, an increase of $126,000, or 18.9%. This increase in operating expenses is due primarily to approximately $79,000 of additional costs related to implementation of our OEM line and $33,000 of pandemic expense related to the retention of employees during the pandemic and supply costs associated with mitigating the spread of COVID-19.\nTrends and Uncertainties\nWe are subject to a number of trends and uncertainties that may affect our short-term or long-term liquidity, sales revenues, and operations. Similar to other farm equipment manufacturers, we are affected by items unique to the farm industry, including fluctuations in farm income resulting from the change in commodity prices, crop damage caused by weather and insects, government farm programs, interest rate fluctuations, and other unpredictable variables. Other uncertainties include our OEM customers and the decisions they make regarding their current supply chain structure, inventory levels, and overall business conditions. Management believes that our business is dependent on the farming industry for the bulk of our sales revenues. As such, our business tends to reap the benefits of increases in farm net income, as farmers tend to purchase equipment in lucrative times and forgo purchases in less profitable years. Direct government payments have been increasing in the past two years and costs of agricultural production are increasing; therefore, we anticipate that further increases in the value of production will benefit our business, while any future decreases in the value of production will decrease farm net income and may harm our financial results.\nAs with other farm equipment manufacturers, we depend on our network of dealers to influence customers\u2019 decisions, and dealer influence is often more persuasive than a manufacturer\u2019s reputation or the price of the product.\nSeasonality\nSales of our agricultural products are seasonal; however, we have tried to decrease the impact of this seasonality through the development of beet harvesting machinery coupled with private labeled products, as the peak periods for these different products occur at different times.\nWe believe that our tool sales are not seasonal. Our modular building sales are somewhat seasonal, and we believe that this is due to the budgeting and funding cycles of the universities that commonly purchase our modular buildings. We believe that this cycle can be offset by building backlogs of inventory and by increasing sales to other public and private sectors.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur main source of funds during the 2020 fiscal year was cash generated by financing activities. We received $1,242,900 of funding and forgiveness via a Paycheck Protection Program loan and also $450,000 of funding from the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program in fiscal 2020. We did use approximately $856,000 of cash in operations in fiscal 2020 which was largely from costs of production for the Agricultural Products and Modular Building segments. We used approximately $693,000 of cash to update facilities and equipment which includes software and hardware related to information technology advances, office space updates, and manufacturing equipment improvements that enhance our efficiency.\nWe have a Bank Midwest credit facility consisting of a $5,000,000 revolving line of credit, pursuant to which we had borrowed $2,359,530, with $2,640,470 remaining, as of November 30, 2020, and one term loan, which had an outstanding principal balance of $2,350,593 as of November 30, 2020. The revolving line of credit is being used for working capital purposes. We also have three Economic Injury Disaster Loans provided by the U.S. Small Business Administration with an aggregate principal balance of $450,000 as of November 30, 2020.\nOur loans require us to comply with various covenants, including maintaining certain financial ratios and obtaining prior written consent from Bank Midwest for any investment in, acquisition of, or guaranty relating to another business or entity. We were out of compliance with our debt service coverage ratio and minimum working capital requirements covenants in place under the Bank Midwest loans as of November 30, 2020. Bank Midwest has issued a waiver forgiving the noncompliance as of November 30, 2020, and in turn waived the event of default. On January 12, 2021, Bank Midwest reduced our working capital requirement through an amendment to our covenants to a level that would put us in compliance at November 30, 2020.\nFor additional information about our financing activities, please refer to Note 9 \u201cLoan and Credit Agreements\u201d to our financial statements in \u201cItem 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\u201d of this report.\nThe following table represents our working capital and current ratio as of the end of the past two fiscal years:\nWe believe that our current cash and financing arrangements will provide sufficient cash to finance operations for the next 12 months. We expect to continue to rely on cash from financing activities to supplement our cash flows from operations in order to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure needs in the near future. We expect to continue to be able to procure financing upon reasonable terms.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.",

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nArt's-Way Manufacturing Co., Inc.\nArmstrong, Iowa\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Art's-Way Manufacturing Co., Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of November 30, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of November 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Eide Bailly LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2006.\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nFebruary 9, 2021\nART\u2019S-WAY MANUFACTURING CO., INC.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nSee accompanying Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm and notes to consolidated financial statements.\nART\u2019S-WAY MANUFACTURING CO., INC.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nSee accompanying Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm and notes to consolidated financial statements.\nART\u2019S-WAY MANUFACTURING CO., INC.\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity\nYears Ended November 30, 2020 and 2019\nSee accompanying Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm and notes to consolidated financial statements.\nART\u2019S-WAY MANUFACTURING CO., INC.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nSee accompanying Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm and notes to consolidated financial statements.\nArt\u2019s-Way Manufacturing Co., Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(1)\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n(a)\nNature of Business\nArt\u2019s-Way Manufacturing Co., Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is primarily engaged in the fabrication and sale of specialized farm machinery in the agricultural sector of the United States. Primary product offerings include portable and stationary animal feed processing equipment; hay and forage equipment; sugar beet harvesting equipment; land maintenance equipment; manure spreaders and moldboard plows. The Company sells its labeled products through independent farm equipment dealers throughout the United States. In addition, the Company manufactures and supplies hay blowers pursuant to OEM agreements. The Company also provides after-market service parts that are available to keep its branded and OEM-produced equipment operating to the satisfaction of the end user of the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company\u2019s Modular Buildings segment is primarily engaged in the construction of modular laboratories and animal housing facilities through the Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, Art\u2019s-Way Scientific, Inc. Buildings commonly produced range from basic swine buildings to complex containment research laboratories. This segment also provides services relating to the design, manufacturing, delivering, installation, and renting of the building units that it produces.\nThe Company\u2019s Tools segment is a domestic manufacturer and distributor of standard single point brazed carbide tipped tools as well as PCD (polycrystalline diamond), CBN (cubic boron nitride) inserts and OEM specialty tools through the Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, Ohio Metal Working Company/Art\u2019s Way, Inc.\n(b)\nImpact of COVID-19\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic had very little impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, it did impact results of operations for the rest of fiscal 2020 and the Company believes that it may continue to do so for the foreseeable future. From March 23, 2020 until May 18, 2020 the majority of the Company\u2019s office staff in all three segments worked remotely with the exception of key operations support. At the height of the initial outbreak the Company\u2019s workforce was down approximately 17% due to self-quarantine. By the end of May 2020, the Company\u2019s entire workforce had returned and operations have continued as normal with additional safety precautions in place. As COVID-19 cases began to rise in November 2020, the Company allowed employees that could perform their job functions remotely do so at their discretion. At this time approximately 75% of the Company\u2019s office staff is working remote at least part-time and this has had minimal effect on operations. The Company expects that by the end of February 2021 remote employees will return full time to the office. Future outbreaks could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s operations and are taking precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\n(c)\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Art\u2019s-Way Manufacturing Co., Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries for the 2020 fiscal year, which includes Art\u2019s-Way Scientific, Inc., and Ohio Metal Working Products/Art\u2019s-Way, Inc. All material inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\n(d)\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nDuring the fiscal year 2020, the Company made a change in accounting estimate related to the estimated costs to complete a material construction contract. The change in estimate was related to the expected collectability of change orders driven from project modifications in the design process and scope gaps that occurred because of the design changes. Further unforeseen costs including increased costs from project delays due to COVID-19, issues with site conditions, subcontractor rework and expected liquidated damages have deteriorated the gross profit margin on the project further through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020. Overall, approximately $1.3 million of additional revenue has been generated since inception of the contract compared to $2.8 million of additional estimated costs to complete. The Company determined this was a change in accounting estimate in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 250-10 \u201cAccounting Changes and Error Corrections\u201d based on the timing of when information was reasonably considered available for the expected additional costs. The Company has approximately $1 million in revenue to recognize at a reduced margin for the Modular Buildings segment in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as a result of this change in estimate.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company made a change in accounting estimate related to the inventory obsolescence reserve for UHC reels, Miller Pro forage and rake, auger, and other non-current product lines. The Company concluded these items were not going to be a part of the Company\u2019s strategic product offering going forward and increased the reserve on these items approximately $681,000 in November 2020. The Company is actively working on a scrap plan for these items to decrease carrying costs for inventory in 2021. The effect of the increased reserve reduced net inventory, added additional cost of goods sold expense reducing income from operations and also had an effect on working capital debt covenants by approximately $681,000. The Company determined this was a change in accounting estimated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 250-10 \u201cAccounting Changes and Error Corrections.\u201d\n(e)\nReclassification of Prior Year Presentation\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations. An adjustment has been made to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2019, to identify the non-cash expense related to changes in the Company\u2019s obsolete inventory reserve in the amount of $79,265. This change in classification does not affect previously reported cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n(f)\nCash Concentration\nThe Company maintains several different accounts at one bank, and balances in these accounts could periodically exceed the federally insured limits. However, management believes the risk of loss to be low.\n(g)\nCustomer Concentration\nDuring the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years, one customer accounted for more than 18% and 21%, respectively, of consolidated revenues due to a large contract in the Modular Buildings segment. The Company\u2019s highest recurring customer accounted for just under 6% and 10% of consolidated net revenues in 2020 and 2019 fiscal years, respectively.\n(h)\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful accounts based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts. Accounts receivable are written-off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written-off are recorded when received. Accounts receivable are generally considered past due 60 days past invoice date, with the exception of international sales which primarily are sold with 180 day terms backed by export insurance.\nTrade receivables due from customers are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms requiring payment within 30 days from the invoice date. Trade receivables are stated at the amount billed to the customer. The Company charges interest on overdue customer account balances at a rate of 1.5% per month. Payments of trade receivables are allocated to the specific invoices identified on the customer\u2019s remittance advice or, if unspecified, are applied to the earliest unpaid invoices.\n(i)\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and cost is determined using the standard costing method. Management monitors the carrying value of inventories using inventory control and review processes that include, but are not limited to, sales forecast review, inventory status reports, and inventory reduction programs. The Company records inventory write downs to net realizable value based on expected usage information for raw materials and historical selling trends for finished goods. Additional write downs may be necessary if the assumptions made by management do not occur.\n(j)\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of plant and equipment is provided using the straight-line method, based on the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from three to 40 years.\n(k)\nSales-Type Leases\nModular buildings held for short term lease by the Modular Buildings segment are recorded at cost. Amortization of the property is calculated over the useful life of the building. Estimated useful life is three to five years. Lease revenue is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease agreement. Lease income for modular buildings is included in sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company leases modular buildings to certain customers and accounts for these transactions as sales-type leases. These leases have terms of up to 36 months and are collateralized by a security interest in the related modular building. The lessee has a bargain purchase option available at the end of the lease term. A minimum lease receivable is recorded net of unearned interest income and profit on sale at the time the Company\u2019s obligation to the lessee is complete. Profit related to the sale of the building is recorded upon fulfillment of the Company\u2019s obligation to the lessee.\nThe components related to sales-type leases at November 30, 2020 and November 30, 2019 are as follows:\nThere was no sales activity related to sales-type leases for the years ended November 30, 2020 and November 30,2019.\nFuture minimum lease receipts from sales-type leases are as follows:\n(l)\nOperating Leases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of a contract. The nature of the Company\u2019s operating leases at this time is office equipment, mainly copiers, with terms of 12 to 60 months. Operating leases are included in other assets as operating lease right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets while current lease liabilities are included as accrued expenses. The long-term portions of operating lease liabilities are shown as long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nROU assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value payments over the lease term. As most of the Company\u2019s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company has copier lease agreements with lease and non-lease components and has elected the practical expedient not to separate lease and non-lease components for this asset class. The Company has also elected not to recognize lease liabilities and ROU assets for short-term leases. The Company recognizes variable costs that depend on usage in profit or loss as they are incurred.\nThe components of operating leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at November 30, 2020 were as follows:\nThe Company included $27,879 of operating lease ROU assets in other assets, the current portion of operating lease liabilities of $9,537 was included in accrued expenses and the $18,342 of long-term operating lease liabilities was included in the long-term liability portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recorded $23,121 of operating lease costs in the year ended November 30, 2020, which included variable costs tied to usage. The Company\u2019s operating leases carry a weighted average lease term of 35 months and have a weighted average discount rate of 5.50%\nFuture maturities of operating lease liabilities are as follows:\n(m)\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is entirely dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\nOn December 28, 2020 the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 was signed into law. This law provides that no amount of loan forgiveness granted under the Paycheck Protection Program shall be included in gross income for tax purposes. The law also allows the deduction of expenses related to the Paycheck Protection Program creating a double tax benefit. The Company attributes 8.8% of tax rate benefit related to the permanent difference from this law.\nThe Company classifies interest and penalties to be paid on an underpayment of taxes as income tax expense. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and previously in Canada. The Company is no longer subject to Canadian, U.S. federal or state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before November 30, 2017.\n(n)\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company\u2019s revenues primarily result from contracts with customers. The major sources of revenue for the Agricultural Products and Tools segments are farm equipment, service parts related to farm equipment and steel cutting tools and inserts. The Agricultural Products and Tools segments generally execute short-term contracts that contain a single performance obligation - the delivery of product to the common carrier. The Company recognizes revenue for the production and sale of farm equipment, service parts and cutting tools upon shipment of the goods. Risk of ownership and title pass to the customer upon shipment of the goods. The Tools segment has an OEM agreement with one customer for which sales are recognized FOB destination - when the goods hit the customer\u2019s dock. All sales are made to authorized dealers whose application for dealer status has been approved and who have been informed of general sales policies. Any changes in the Company\u2019s terms are documented in the most recently published price lists. Pricing is fixed and determinable according to the Company\u2019s published equipment and parts price lists. Title to all equipment and parts sold passes to the customer upon delivery to the carrier and is not subject to a customer acceptance provision. Proof of the passing of title is documented and retained by the Company. Post shipment obligations are limited to any claim with respect to the condition of the equipment or parts. The Agricultural Products and Tools segments each typically require payment in full 30 days after the ship date. To take advantage of program discounts, some customers pay deposits up front. Any deposits received increase contract liabilities.\nIn certain circumstances, upon the customer\u2019s written request, the Company may recognize revenue when production is complete, and the goods are ready for shipment. At the customer\u2019s request, the Company will bill the customer upon completing all performance obligations, but before shipment. The customer dictates that the Company ship the goods per the customer\u2019s direction from the Company\u2019s manufacturing facility, as is customary with this type of agreement, in order to minimize shipping costs. The written agreement with the customer specifies that the goods will be delivered on a schedule to be determined by the customer, with a final specified delivery date, and that the Company will segregate the goods from its inventory, such that they are not available to fill other orders. This agreement also specifies that the customer is required to purchase all goods manufactured under this agreement. Title of the goods will pass to the customer when the goods are complete and ready for shipment, per the customer agreement. At the transfer of title, all risks of ownership have passed to the customer, and the customer agrees to maintain insurance on the manufactured items that have not yet been shipped. The Company has operated using bill and hold agreements with certain customers for many years, with consistent satisfactory results for both the customer and the Company. The credit terms on these agreements are consistent with the credit terms on all other sales. All risks of loss are shouldered by the customer, and there are no exceptions to the customer\u2019s commitment to accept and pay for these manufactured goods. Revenues recognized at the completion of production in the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years were approximately $0 and $16,000, respectively.\nThe Modular Buildings segment is in the construction industry with its major source of revenue arising from modular building sales. Sales of modular buildings are generally recognized using input methods to measure progress towards the satisfaction of a performance obligation using the percentage of completion method. Revenue and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Contract costs consist of direct costs on contracts, including labor, materials, amounts payable to subcontractors and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as equipment costs, insurance and employee benefits. Contract cost is recorded as incurred, and revisions in contract revenues and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Contract losses are recognized when current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost indicate a loss. Estimated contract costs include any and all costs appropriately allocable to the contract. The provision for these contract losses will be the excess of estimated contract costs over estimated contract revenues. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract change orders, penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. The Company uses significant judgements in determining estimated contract costs and completion percentages throughout the life of the project. Stock modular building sales also occur and are recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation is fulfilled through substantial completion. Substantial completion is achieved through customer acceptance of the completed building. The Modular Buildings segment executes contracts with customers that can be short- or long-term in nature. These contracts can have multiple performance obligations and revenue from these can be recognized over time or at a point in time depending on the nature of the contracts. Payment terms for the Modular Buildings segment vary by contract, but typically utilize money down and progress payments throughout the life of the contract. The payment terms of the Modular Buildings segment have the most impact on the Company\u2019s contract receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities. Project invoicing from the Modular Buildings segment increases contract receivables and has an effect on contract liabilities through billings in excess of costs and estimated gross profit and advanced payments. The balance of contract assets is typically made up of the balance of costs and estimated gross profit in excess of billings. Costs and profit in excess of amounts billed are classified as current assets and billings in excess of cost and profit are classified as current liabilities.\nThe Company leases modular buildings to certain customers and accounts for these transactions as operating or sales-type leases. These leases have terms of up to 36 months and are collateralized by a security interest in the related modular building. On sales-type leases, the lessee has a bargain purchase option available at the end of the lease term. A minimum lease receivable is recorded net of unearned interest income and profit on sale at the time the building is substantially complete. Profit related to the sale of the building is recorded upon fulfillment of the Company\u2019s obligation to the lessee. On operating leases, the Company recognizes rent when the lessee has all the rights and benefits of ownership of the asset.\nThe Agricultural Products segment offers variable consideration in the form of discounts depending on participation in yearly early order programs. This variable consideration is allocated to the transaction price of all products in a sales arrangement and is not contingent on future outcomes. The Agricultural Products segment does not offer rebates or credits. The Tools segment offers quantity discounts that are allocated to the transaction price of each product once the quantity break is achieved. The Tools segment does not offer rebates or credits. The Modular Buildings segment does not offer discounts, rebates or credits.\nThe Company\u2019s returns policy allows for new and saleable parts to be returned, subject to inspection and a restocking charge, which is included in net sales. Whole goods are not returnable. Shipping costs charged to customers are included in net sales. Freight costs incurred are included in cost of goods sold. Customer deposits consist of advance payments from customers, in the form of cash, for revenue to be recognized in the following year.\nFor information on product warranty as it applies to ASC 606, refer to Note 8 \u201cProduct Warranty.\u201d\n(o)\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table displays revenue by reportable segment from external customers, disaggregated by major source. The Company believes disaggregating by these categories depicts how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\n(p)\nContract Receivables, Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nThe following table provides information about contract receivables, contract assets, and contract liabilities from contracts with customers included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe amount of revenue recognized in fiscal year 2020 that was included in a contract liability at November 30, 2019 was approximately $89,000 compared to $185,000 for the same period of fiscal year 2019. The change in contract receivables reflected above results from contract billings for all three segments as performance obligations are met. The decrease in contract assets from November 30, 2019 is due to billings on construction contracts catching up to expenses incurred while the increase in contract liabilities is due to overbillings on projects for the Modular Buildings segment.\nThe Company will utilize the practical expedient exception for these contracts and will report only on performance obligations greater than one year. As of November 30, 2020, and November 30, 2019, the Company has no performance obligations with an original expected duration greater than one year.\n(q)\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed when incurred. Such costs approximated $199,000 and $149,000 for the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years, respectively.\n(r)\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred. Such costs approximated $175,000 and $198,000 for the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years, respectively. The Company has made a concerted effort to reduce trade show participation that was not providing the level of product exposure expected.\n(s)\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock\nBasic net income (loss) per share has been computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock has been computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus equivalent shares of common stock assuming exercise of stock options. Potential shares of common stock that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock.\nBasic and diluted (loss) per common share have been computed based on the following as of November 30, 2020 and 2019:\n(t)\nStock Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock-based awards measured at the grant date and recognized over the relevant vesting period. The Company estimates the fair value of each stock-based award on the measurement date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model which incorporates assumptions as to stock price volatility, the expected life of the options, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. Restricted stock is valued at market value at the day of grant.\n(u)\nUse of Estimates\nManagement has made a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reported amount of assets and liabilities, reported amount of revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n(v)\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nAdopted Accounting Pronouncements\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU 2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842),\u201d which requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on its balance sheet for all leases with terms of 12 months or greater. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those years. The Company adopted this guidance for fiscal 2020 using the modified retrospective approach, including interim periods within that reporting period. Under the modified retrospective approach, the Company did not adjust prior comparative periods. The Company has a moderate amount of leasing activity mainly as the lessee of office equipment and as the lessor of modular buildings. As a result of adoption in the first fiscal quarter of 2020, the Company recognized $34,316 as a right-of-use asset and $34,316 of lease liabilities on the balance sheet for office equipment it leases. The Company\u2019s activity as a lessor will remain mostly unaffected by this guidance. The Company\u2019s additional disclosures may include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nNature of its leases\n\u2022\nSignificant assumptions and judgements used\n\u2022\nInformation about leases that have not yet commenced\n\u2022\nRelated-party lease transactions\n\u2022\nAccounting policy election regarding short-term leases\n\u2022\nFinance, operating, short-term and variable lease costs\n\u2022\nMaturity analysis of operating lease payments, lease receivables and lease obligations\n\u2022\nTabular disclosure of lease-related income\n\u2022\nComponents of the net investment in a lease\n\u2022\nInformation on the management of risk associated with residual asset\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, \u201cMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\u201d ASU 2016-13 adds a current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) impairment model to U.S. GAAP that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Modified retrospective adoption is required with any cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within the year of adoption. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in fiscal year 2024. The Company does not expect the application of the CECL impairment model to have a significant impact on its allowance for uncollectible amounts for accounts receivable.\n(2)\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nA summary of the Company\u2019s activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows:\n(3)\nInventories\nMajor classes of inventory are:\n(4)\nContracts in Progress\nAmounts included in the consolidated financial statements related to uncompleted contracts are as follows:\nThe amounts billed on these long-term contracts are due 30 days from invoice date. All amounts billed are expected to be collected within the next 12 months. Retainage was $36,488 and $0 as of November 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(5)\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nMajor classes of property, plant, and equipment are:\nDepreciation and amortization expense totaled $818,234 and $1,003,541 for the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years, respectively.\n(6)\nAssets Held for Lease\nMajor components of assets held for lease are:\nThe Company\u2019s Modular Buildings segment enters into leasing arrangements with customers from time-to-time. The Company had seven buildings in assets held for lease at November 30, 2020 compared to eight at November 30, 2019.\nRents recognized in sales were related to the leasing of modular buildings as a part of the normal course of business operations of the Modular Buildings segment. Rents recognized from assets held for lease included in sales on the consolidated statements of operations during the 2020 fiscal year were $318,000 compared to $674,000 in the 2019 fiscal year. Rents recognized from assets held for lease included in other income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations during the 2019 fiscal year were $2,500.\nThe Company has no expected future minimum lease receipts from assets held for lease at November 30, 2020.\n(7)\nAccrued Expenses\nMajor components of accrued expenses are:\n(8)\nProduct Warranty\nThe Company offers warranties of various lengths to its customers depending on the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement. The average length of the warranty period is one year from the date of purchase. The Company\u2019s warranties require it to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the customer. Product warranty is included in the price of the product and provides assurance that the product will function in accordance with agreed-upon specifications. It does not represent a separate performance obligation under ASC 606. The Company records a liability for estimated costs that may be incurred under its warranties. The costs are estimated based on historical experience and any specific warranty issues that have been identified. Although historical warranty costs have been within expectations, there can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical amounts. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability and adjusts the balance as necessary.\nChanges in the Company\u2019s product warranty liability included in accrued expenses for the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years are as follows:\n(9)\nLoan and Credit Agreements\nThe Company maintains two revolving lines of credit and one term loan with Bank Midwest. The Company also has three term loans with the U.S. Small Business Administration under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program.\nBank Midwest Revolving Lines of Credit and Term Loan\nThe Company maintains a credit facility with Bank Midwest consisting of a $5,000,000 revolving line of credit (the \u201c2017 Line of Credit\u201d) used for working capital purposes, and a $2,600,000 term loan due October 1, 2037 (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d). On November 30, 2020, the balance of the 2017 Line of Credit was $2,359,530 with $2,640,470 remaining available, as may be limited by the borrowing base calculation. The 2017 Line of Credit borrowing base is an amount equal to 75% of accounts receivable balances (discounted for aged receivables), plus 50% of inventory, less any outstanding loan balance on the 2017 Line of Credit. At November 30, 2020, the 2017 Line of Credit was not limited by the borrowing base calculation. Any unpaid principal amount borrowed on the 2017 Line of Credit accrues interest at a floating rate per annum equal to 1.00% above the Wall Street Journal rate published in the money rates section of the Wall Street Journal. The interest rate floor is set at 4.25% per annum and the current interest rate is 4.25% per annum. The 2017 Line of Credit was most recently renewed on March 30, 2020. The 2017 Line of Credit matures on March 30, 2021 and requires monthly interest-only payments.\nThe Term Loan accrues interest at a rate of 5.00% for the first sixty months. Thereafter, the Term Loan will accrue interest at a floating rate per annum equal to 0.75% above the Wall Street Journal rate published in the money rates section of the Wall Street Journal. The interest rate floor is set at 4.15% per annum and the interest rate may only be adjusted by Bank Midwest once every five years. Monthly payments of $17,271 for principal and interest are required. The Term Loan is also guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d), which required an upfront guarantee fee of $62,400 and requires an annual fee of 0.5% of the unpaid balance. As part of the USDA guarantee requirements, shareholders owning more than 20% are required to personally guarantee a portion of the Term Loan, in an amount equal to their stock ownership percentage. J. Ward McConnell Jr., the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and a shareholder owning more than 20% of the Company\u2019s outstanding stock, is guaranteeing approximately 38% of the Term Loan, for an annual fee of 2% of the personally guaranteed amount. The initial guarantee fee will be amortized over the life of the Term Loan, and the annual fees and personally guaranteed amounts are expensed monthly.\nOn February 13, 2019, the Company opened a $4,000,000 revolving line of credit (the \u201c2019 Line of Credit\u201d) with Bank Midwest in connection with bonding obligations for the Company\u2019s performance of a large modular laboratory construction project. Funds under the 2019 Line of Credit will be undisbursed to the Company and will be held by Bank Midwest in connection with an Irrevocable Letter of Credit issued by Bank Midwest for the project. The 2019 Line of Credit accrues interest at a floating rate per annum equal to 1.00% above the Wall Street Journal rate published in the money rates section of the Wall Street Journal. The interest rate floor is set at 4.25% per annum and the current interest rate is 4.25% per annum. The 2019 Line of Credit was recently renewed on February 2, 2021. The 2019 Line of Credit is payable upon demand by Bank Midwest. If no earlier demand is made, the unpaid principal and accrued interest will be payable in one payment, due on February 13, 2022. As of November 30, 2020, the funds on the 2019 Line of Credit remain undisbursed and are held by Bank Midwest. The Company expects to close the line when the project\u2019s lien period closes later in fiscal 2021.\nOn April 20, 2020, the Company obtained a loan in the amount of $1,242,900 from Bank Midwest in connection with the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d). The PPP Loan accrued interest at a rate per annum equal to 1.00% and was eligible to be used for payroll costs, employee benefits, rent, utilities and mortgage interest. The PPP Loan was unsecured. On November 4, 2020 complete forgiveness was granted from the U.S. Small Business Administration.\nEach of the 2017 Line of Credit and the Term Loan are governed by the terms of a separate Promissory Note, dated September 28, 2017, entered into between the Company and Bank Midwest. The 2019 Line of Credit is governed by the terms of a Promissory Note, dated February 13, 2019, entered into between the Company and Bank Midwest.\nIn connection with the 2017 Line of Credit, the Company, Art\u2019s-Way Scientific Inc. and Ohio Metal Working Products/Art\u2019s-Way Inc. each entered into a Commercial Security Agreement with Bank Midwest, dated September 28, 2017, pursuant to which each granted to Bank Midwest a first priority security interest in certain inventory, equipment, accounts, chattel paper, instruments, letters of credit and other assets to secure the obligations of the Company under the line of credit. Each of Art\u2019s-Way Scientific Inc. and Ohio Metal Working Products/Art\u2019s-Way Inc. also agreed to guarantee the obligations of the Company pursuant to the 2017 Line of Credit, as set forth in Commercial Guaranties, each dated September 28, 2017. The 2019 Line of Credit is also secured by these existing security documents.\nTo further secure the 2017 Line of Credit, the Company granted Bank Midwest a mortgage on its Canton, Ohio property held by Ohio Metal Working Products/Art\u2019s-Way Inc. The 2019 Line of Credit is also secured by the mortgage on the Canton, Ohio property. The Term Loan is secured by a mortgage on the Company\u2019s Armstrong, Iowa and Monona, Iowa properties. Each mortgage is governed by the terms of a separate Mortgage, dated September 28, 2017, and each property is also subject to a separate Assignment of Rents, dated September 28, 2017.\nIf the Company or its subsidiaries (as guarantors pursuant to the Commercial Guaranties) commits an event of default with respect to the promissory notes and fails or is unable to cure that default, Bank Midwest may immediately terminate its obligation, if any, to make additional loans to the Company and may accelerate the Company\u2019s obligations under the promissory notes. Bank Midwest shall also have all other rights and remedies for default provided by the Uniform Commercial Code, as well as any other applicable law and the various loan agreements. In addition, in an event of default, Bank Midwest may foreclose on the mortgaged property.\nCompliance with Bank Midwest covenants is measured annually at November 30. The terms of the Bank Midwest loan agreements require the Company to maintain a minimum working capital ratio of 1.75, while maintaining a minimum of $5,100,000 of working capital. Additionally, a maximum debt to worth ratio of 1 to 1 must be maintained, with a minimum of 40% tangible balance sheet equity, with variations subject to mutual agreement. The Company is also required to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.25, with a 0.10 tolerance. The Company also must receive bank approval for purchases or sales of equipment over $100,000 annually and maintain reasonable salaries and owner compensation. The Company received the necessary approvals for purchases of equipment over $100,000 for the twelve months ended November 30, 2020. The Company was out of compliance with its debt service coverage ratio and minimum working capital requirements covenants in place under the Bank Midwest loans as of November 30, 2020. Bank Midwest issued a waiver forgiving the noncompliance, and in turn waived the event of default. The next measurement date is November 30, 2021.\nOn January 12, 2021 Bank Midwest amended the Company\u2019s working capital requirement of maintaining a minimum working capital ratio of 1.75, while also maintaining $5,100,000 of working capital. The new covenant requires the Company to maintain a working capital requirement of $4,000,000 and drops the requirement to maintain a minimum working capital ratio of 1.75.\nSBA Economic Injury Disaster Loans\nOn June 18, 2020, and again on June 24, 2020 the Company executed the standard loan documents required for securing loans offered by the U.S. Small Business Administration under its Economic Injury Disaster Loan (\u201cEIDL\u201d) assistance program in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s business. Two loans were executed on June 18, 2020 with principal amounts of $150,000 each, with a third loan being executed on June 24, 2020 with a principal amount of $150,000. Proceeds from these EIDLs are being used for working capital purposes. Interest accrues at the rate of 3.75% per annum and will accrue from the date of inception. Installment payments, including principal and interest, are due monthly beginning June 18, 2021 (twelve months from the date of the EIDLs) and June 24, 2021 in the amount of $731 per EIDL. The balance of principal and interest is payable 30 years from the date of the EIDL. The EIDLs are secured by a security interest on all of the Company\u2019s assets. Each EIDL is governed by the terms of a separate Promissory Note, dated either June 18, 2020 or June 24, 2020, as applicable, entered into by the Company or the applicable subsidiary.\nA summary of the Company\u2019s term debt is as follows:\nA summary of the minimum maturities of term debt follows for the years ending November 30:\n(10)\nRelated Party Transactions\nDuring the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years, the Company did not recognize any revenues from transactions with a related party, and no amounts in accounts receivable balances were due from a related party. From time to time, the Company purchases various supplies from related parties, which are companies owned by J. Ward McConnell, Jr., the Vice Chairman of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. Marc McConnell, the Chairman of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors also serves as President of these companies. J. Ward McConnell, Jr. as a shareholder owning more than 20% of the Company\u2019s outstanding stock, was required to guarantee a portion of the Company\u2019s term debt in accordance with the USDA guarantee on the Company\u2019s term loan. J. Ward McConnell, Jr. is paid a monthly fee for his guarantee. In the 2020 fiscal year, the Company recognized $19,232 of expense for transactions with related parties, compared to $26,506 in the 2019 fiscal year. As of November 30, 2020, accrued expenses contained a balance of $1,464 owed to a related party compared to $1,517 on November 30, 2019.\n(11)\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) savings plan which covers substantially all full-time employees who meet eligibility requirements. Participating employees may contribute as salary reductions any amount of their compensation up to the limit prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company makes a 25% matching contribution to employees contributing a minimum of 4% of their compensation, up to 1% of eligible compensation. Effective January 1, 2021 the Company began making a 50% matching contribution up to 3% of eligible compensation. The Company recognized an expense of $32,464 and $36,253 related to this plan during the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years, respectively.\n(12)\nEquity Incentive Plan\nThe compensation cost charged against income was $247,645 and $195,416 for the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years, respectively. The total income tax deductions for share-based compensation arrangements were $176,435 and $122,022 for the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years, respectively. No compensation cost was capitalized as part of inventory or fixed assets.\nOn February 25, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company (the \u201cBoard\u201d) authorized and approved the Art\u2019s-Way Manufacturing Co., Inc. 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2020 Plan\u201d). The 2020 Plan was approved by the stockholders on April 30, 2020. The 2020 Plan replaces the Art\u2019s-Way Manufacturing Co., Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2011 Plan\u201d) and adds an additional 500,000 shares to the number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to equity awards. No further awards will be made under the 2011 Plan or other prior plans. Awards to directors and executive officers under the 2020 Plan are governed by the forms of agreement approved by the Board of Directors. Stock options or other awards granted prior to February 25, 2020 are governed by the applicable prior plan and the forms of agreement adopted thereunder.\nThe 2020 Plan permits the plan administrator to award nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance awards, and stock appreciation rights to employees (including officers), directors, and consultants. The Board has approved a director compensation policy pursuant to which non-employee directors are automatically granted restricted stock awards of 1,000 shares of fully vested common stock annually or initially upon their election to the Board and another 1,000 shares of fully vested common stock on the last business day of each fiscal quarter. During the year ended November 30, 2020, restricted stock awards of 128,750 shares were issued to various employees, directors, and consultants, which vest over the next three years, and restricted stock awards of 25,000 shares were issued to directors as part of the director compensation policy, which vested immediately upon grant. In comparison, during fiscal 2019, restricted stock awards of 56,750 shares were issued to various employees, directors, and consultants, which vest over three years from the date of issuance, restricted stock awards of 9,000 shares were issued to various employees, which vested immediately upon grant, and restricted stock awards of 31,687 were issued to directors as part of the director compensation policy. During the 2020 fiscal year, 74,685 shares of restricted stock became unrestricted, 4,833 shares of restricted stock were forfeited, and the Company bought 16,255 shares back as treasury stock from employees to pay payroll tax on vested shares. During 2019 fiscal year, 32,600 shares of restricted stock became unrestricted, 1,400 shares of restricted stock were forfeited, and the Company bought 9,556 shares back as treasury stock from employees to pay payroll tax on vested shares.\nStock-based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock-based awards measured at the grant date and recognized over the relevant vesting period. The Company estimates the fair value of each stock-based option award on the measurement date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model which incorporates assumptions as to stock price volatility, the expected life of the options, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company\u2019s stock and other factors. The Company uses historical option exercise and termination data to estimate the expected term the options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield is calculated using historical dividend amounts and the stock price at the option issuance date. No stock options were granted during the years ended November 30, 2020 or 2019. Stock compensation net of treasury shares repurchased for the year ended November 30, 2020 was $216,649 compared to $176,093 for the same period in fiscal 2019.\nThe fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company\u2019s stock and other factors. The Company uses historical option exercise and termination data to estimate the expected term the options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield is calculated using historical dividend amounts and the stock price at the option issuance date.\nThe following is a summary of activity under the plans as of November 30, 2020 and 2019, and changes during the years then ended:\nNo options were granted or vested during the 2020 or 2019 fiscal years. As of both November 30, 2020 and November 30, 2019, there were no non-vested options. As of November 30, 2020, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements under the plan related to stock options.\nThe Company received no cash from the exercise of options during the 2020 or 2019 fiscal years.\n(13)\nIncome Taxes\nTotal income tax expense (benefit) for the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years consists of the following:\nThe reconciliation of the statutory Federal income tax rate is as follows:\nTax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) at November 30, 2020 and 2019 are presented as approximate amounts below:\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company\u2019s net operating loss amounting to approximately $7,479,000 and tax credit carryforward amounting to approximately $109,000 for its U.S. operations expire on November 30, 2036, 2037, 2038, 2039 and 2040. Management believes that the Company will be able to utilize the U.S. net operating losses and credits before their expiration.\n(14)\nDisclosures About the Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. At November 30, 2020 and November 30, 2019, the carrying amount approximated fair value for cash, accounts receivable, net investment in sales-type leases, accounts payable, notes payable to bank, and other current and long-term liabilities. The carrying amounts of current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of the net investment in sales-type leases also approximates recorded value as that is based on discounting future cash flows at rates implicit in the lease. The rates implicit in the lease do not materially differ from current market rates. The fair value of the Company\u2019s term loans payable also approximates recorded value because the interest rates charged under the loan terms are not substantially different from current interest rates.\n(15)\nLitigation and Contingencies\nVarious legal actions and claims that arise in the normal course of business are pending against the Company. In the opinion of management adequate provisions have been made in the accompanying financial statements for all pending legal actions and other claims.\n(16)\nSegment Information\nThere are three reportable segments: Agricultural Products, Modular Buildings, and Tools. The Agricultural Products segment fabricates and sells farming products as well as replacement parts for these products in the United States and worldwide. The Modular Buildings segment produces modular buildings for animal containment and various laboratory uses. The Tools segment manufactures steel cutting tools and inserts.\nThe accounting policies applied to determine the segment information are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Management evaluates the performance of each segment based on profit or loss from operations before income taxes.\nApproximate financial information with respect to the reportable segments is as follows.\n(17)\nSubsequent Events\nManagement evaluated all other activity of the Company and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the consolidated financial statements or disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements other than the change to the Company\u2019s working capital covenant and the renewal of the 2019 Line of Credit, both discussed in Note 9 \u201cLoan and Credit agreements\u201d to our financial statements in \u201cItem 8.

    "item_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe persons serving as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), as of the end of the period subject to this report. Based on this evaluation, the persons serving as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of November 30, 2020. Our management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the persons serving as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of November 30, 2020.\nThis report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management\u2019s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management\u2019s report in this report.\nRemediation of Material Weakness\nManagement previously identified that a material weakness existed as of November 30, 2019 related to the estimation of completed subcontract work on modular building contracts. Management recognizes that estimates are a necessary part of financial reporting; however, proper controls did not exist to review the accuracy of these estimates at the time of the transactions. Because we recorded an adjustment to the financial statements, this control deficiency did not result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended November 30, 2019.\nManagement implemented new internal controls in the first quarter of the 2020 fiscal year to remediate this material weakness. All accounts payable are reviewed and signed off on by the general manager and Chief Financial Officer for accuracy and completeness on a monthly basis with particular scrutiny on unvouchered receipts. Any subcontract work received over $75,000 requires approval signatures from the Chief Financial Officer and general manager if an invoice is not present. These controls help prevent and detect material misstatements that could otherwise results from the estimation of subcontract work. These new internal controls are subject to continued management review supported by testing, as well as oversight by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Based on testing that occurred in the 2020 fiscal year we concluded that this material weakness has been fully remediated.\nLimitations on Controls\nOur management, including the persons serving as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. In addition, the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and controls may become inadequate if conditions change. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nChanges to Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting except for the remediation of material weakness that was described previously.",
