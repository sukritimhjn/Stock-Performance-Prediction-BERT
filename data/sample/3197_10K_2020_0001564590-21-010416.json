    "item_1": "Item 1.\nBusiness\nGeneral\nCECO Environmental Corp. (\u201cCECO,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a global leader in industrial air quality and fluid handling serving the energy, industrial and other niche markets through an attractive asset-light business model. We focus on engineering, designing, building, and installing systems that capture, clean and destroy airborne contaminants from industrial facilities as well as equipment that controls emissions from such facilities, as well as fluid handling and filtration systems. CECO provides innovative technology and application expertise that helps companies grow their businesses with safe, clean, and more efficient solutions to help protect our shared environment.\nCECO serves diverse industries globally by working to improve air quality, optimize the energy value chain, and provide customized engineered solutions in our customers\u2019 mission critical applications. The industries CECO serves include power generation, petrochemical processing, general industrial, refining, oil & gas, electric vehicle production, poly silicon fabrication, battery recycling, and wastewater treatment, along with a wide range of other industries.\nCECO has over $6 billion of installed equipment with end users, which we target to expand and grow a higher recurring revenue of aftermarket products and services.\nOur customers include some of the largest natural gas processors, transmission and distribution companies, refineries, power generators, industrial manufacturing, engineering and construction companies, semiconductor manufacturers, compressor manufacturers, metals and minerals, and electric vehicle producers in the world.\nWe believe our value differentiators include, but are not limited to, our product quality, reliability, on-time delivery and safety, supported by advanced engineering and operational excellence. We believe these are critical in maintaining our competitive position and have adopted a spirit of continuous improvement to ensure we maintain our market leadership position.\nIndustry Overview\nWe serve a growing $5 billion dollar global market that is highly fragmented and serves various end markets including power generation, natural gas power plants, petrochemical processing, general industrial, refining, oil & gas and wastewater treatment.\nWe believe demand for our products and services will continue to be driven by the following factors:\n\u2022\nGlobal Focus on Environment. Increased demand for efficient solutions and reduced emissions for clean air remains at the forefront of sustainable production. As our customers and end markets navigate this changing landscape, we are making production cleaner, more efficient and flexible, and workplaces safer, using the same high manufacturing standards our customers expect. Increasingly, society, along with government regulation, call for corporations to commit to the preservation and protection of the environment. We believe that through our air quality and emissions control initiatives, companies want to work with us to protect people and our planet from the harmful effects of industrial processes.\n\u2022\nGlobal Economic Conditions. The Company\u2019s businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe. Higher economic growth and other factors that would increase industrial gross domestic product and capital expenditures are projected to impact the markets the Company serves and could affect the Company\u2019s businesses by increasing demand for the Company\u2019s products and services.\n\u2022\nWorldwide Industrialization. Global trade has increased significantly over the last decade and is driven by growth in emerging markets, including China and India, as well as other developing nations in Asia and the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d) region. As a result of globalization, manufacturing that was historically performed domestically continues to migrate to lower cost countries. This movement of the manufacture of goods throughout the world increases demand for industrial ventilation products as new construction continues. We expect that more rigorous environmental regulations will be introduced to create a cleaner working environment and reduce environmental emissions as these economies evolve.\n\u2022\nNatural Gas Infrastructure. The natural gas industry consists of the exploration, production, processing, transportation, storage and distribution of natural gas. The International Energy Association (\u201cIEA\u201d) projects a pronounced shift in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) countries away from oil and coal towards natural gas and renewables. Natural gas continues to be the fuel of choice for the electrical power and industrial sectors in many\nof the world\u2019s regions, in part because of its lower carbon intensity compared with coal and oil, which makes it an attractive fuel source in countries where governments are implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\u2022\nPower Generation. Power generation encompasses a broad range of activities related to the production of electricity. The primary types of fossil fuels used to generate electricity are coal, natural gas and nuclear. In the United States, concerns about potential environmental regulations enhance the attractiveness of natural gas-fired power plants compared with coal-fired power plants, which generally have higher pollutant emission rates than natural gas-powered plants. Natural gas-fired power plants have lower initial capital needs and are more flexible in terms of operating times than coal plants.\n\u2022\nRefining, Oil Production and Petrochemical Processing. Refining, oil production and petrochemical processing involves the producing, refining and processing of fuels and chemicals for use in a variety of applications, such as gasoline, fertilizers and plastics. In response to increasing international demand for petrochemicals and refined products, companies are producing more products from new sources, constructing new refineries and petrochemical processing facilities as well as expanding existing facilities. In many cases, these new and expanded facilities must comply with stricter environmental regulations, which influence both choice of fuel and demand for systems to control exhaust emissions.\n\u2022\nStringent Regulatory Environment. The adoption of increasingly stringent environmental regulations globally requires businesses to pay strict attention to environmental protection. Businesses and industries of all types from refineries, power, chemical processes, metals and minerals, energy market and industrial manufacturing must comply with these various international, federal, state and local government regulations or potentially face substantial fines or be forced to suspend production or alter their production processes. These increasingly stringent environmental regulations are a principal factor that drives our business.\nThese factors, individually or collectively, tend to cause increases in industrial capital spending that are not directly impacted by general economic conditions, expansion, or capacity increases. In contrast, favorable conditions in the economy generally lead to plant expansions and the construction of new industrial sites. However, in a weak economy, customers tend to lengthen the time from their initial inquiry to the purchase order or defer purchases.\nMission and Strategy\nOur mission is to help companies grow their business with safe, clean and more efficient solutions that help protect people and our shared environment.\nWe seek to fulfill this mission through established global leadership in air quality and fluid handling solutions focused on serving the energy, industrial, and other niche markets around the world. We will continue to leverage our innovative technology and application expertise to customers around the world. We work to improve air quality, optimize the energy value chain, and provide custom engineered solutions for applications including power generation, petrochemical processing, general industrial, refining, oil & gas, electric vehicle production, poly silicon fabrication, battery recycling, and wastewater treatment along with a wide range of other applications.\nOur strategy to become the global leader in air quality and fluid handling solutions is to drive an operating environment of performance excellence across the Company with a near term focus on targeted value creation enablers, and growth-oriented business segment performance.\nWe constantly look for opportunities to gain new customers and penetrate geographic locations and end markets with existing products and services or acquire new product or service opportunities. We intend to continue to expand our customer base and end markets and have continued to pursue potential attractive growth opportunities both domestically and internationally. In the past few years, we have expanded our international presence with new sales & engineering hubs in the United Kingdom, Shanghai, Singapore, Pune India, and Dubai.\nFour Value Creation Enablers Driving Growth\nAll four of these are inter-connected and critical to achieving our objectives.\n\u2022\nOutside-In Leadership is all about an increased attention on our customers and the trends affecting the world around us as we make decisions that enable CECO to be responsive and prepared for growth.\n\u2022\nInnovation is about us finding better ways to help our customers get their jobs done - whether that is a new product and technology or the way we serve and work with them.\n\u2022\nSimplification involves aligning and streamlining our operational practices and metrics to match our customers\u2019 key performance indicators (\u201cKPIs\u201d) for success and removing complexity from our systems and structure.\n\u2022\nActive Portfolio Management dictates a regular evaluation of our business units for market attractiveness and profitability together with scanning the market for attractive potential additions that strengthen the long-term outlook of the Company.\nThree Business Segments:\nThe Company operates and reports in three reportable segments focused on attractive end markets. Each segment is aligned to generate profitable growth for the Company across a targeted industry with a compelling technology and solution set to benefit customers.\n\u2022\nEnergy Solutions segment: Our Energy Solutions segment serves the Energy market, where we are a key part of helping meet the global demand for clean energy and lower emissions through our highly engineered and tailored emissions management, silencers and separation solutions and services.

Our offerings in clean air pollution control, collection and ventilation technologies improve air quality with a compelling solution that enable our customers in the semiconductor manufacturing, electric vehicle production, battery recycling, and wood manufacturing industries to reduce their carbon footprint, lower energy consumption, minimize waste and meet compliance targets for toxic emissions, fumes, volatile organic compounds, and industrial odors.\n\u2022\nFluid Handling Solutions segment: Our Fluid Handling Solutions segment offers unique pump and filtration solutions that maintain safe and clean operations in some of the most harsh and toxic environments. In this market, we provide solutions for mission-critical applications to a wide variety of industries including, but not limited to, plating and metal finishing, automotive, food and beverage, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, wastewater treatment, desalination and the aquarium & aquaculture markets.\nCompetitive Strengths\nLeading market position as a complete solution provider. We believe we are a leading provider of critical solutions in industrial air quality and fluid handling. The multi-billion dollar global market is highly fragmented with numerous small and regional contracting firms separately supplying engineering services, fabrication, installation, testing and monitoring, products and spare parts. We offer our customers a complete end-to-end solution, including engineering and project management services, procurement and fabrication, construction and installation, aftermarket support, and sale of consumables, which allows our customers to avoid dealing with multiple vendors when managing projects.\nLong-standing experience and customer relationships in growing industry. We have serviced the needs of our target markets for over 50 years. Our extensive experience and expertise in providing diversified solutions enhances our overall customer relationships, and provides us with a competitive advantage in our markets relative to other companies in the industry. We believe this is evidenced by strong relationships with many of our world-class customers. We believe no single competitor has the resources to offer a similar portfolio of product and service capabilities. We offer the depth of a large organization, while our lean organizational structure keeps us close to our customers and markets, allowing us to offer rapid and complete solutions in each unique situation.\nGlobal diversification and broad customer base. The global diversity of our operations and customer base provides us with multiple growth opportunities. As of December 31, 2020, we had a diversified customer base of approximately 5,000 active customers across a range of industries. We believe that the diversity of our customers and end markets mitigates our risk of a potential fluctuation or downturn in demand from any individual industry or particular customer. We believe we have the resources and capabilities to meet the needs of our customers as they upgrade and expand domestically as well as into new international markets. Once systems have been installed and a relationship has been established with the customer, we are often awarded repetitive service and maintenance business as the customers\u2019 processes change and modifications or additions to their systems become necessary.\nExperienced management and engineering team. Our senior management team has substantial experience in industrial air quality and fluid handling solutions. The business experience of our management team enables us to pursue our strategy. Our workforce includes\napproximately 400 engineers, designers, solution experts, and project managers whose significant specialized industry experience and technical expertise enables them to have a deep understanding of the solutions that will best suit the needs of our customers. The experience and stability of our management, operating and engineering teams have been crucial to our growth, developing and maintaining customer relationships, and increasing our market share.\nDevelop innovative solutions. We leverage our engineering and manufacturing expertise and strong customer relationships to develop new customized products to address the identified needs of our customers or a particular end market. We thoroughly analyze new product opportunities by considering projected demand for the product or service, price point, and expected operating costs, and only pursue those opportunities that we believe will contribute to earnings growth in the near-term. In addition, we continually improve our traditional technologies and adapt them to new industries and processes.\nDisciplined acquisition program with successful integration. We believe that we have demonstrated an ability to successfully acquire and integrate companies with complementary product or service offerings. We will continue to seek and execute additional strategic acquisitions and focus on expanding our product service and breadth, as well as entering into new adjacent markets. We believe that the breadth and diversity of our products and services and our ability to deliver full solutions to various end markets provides us with multiple sources of stable growth and a competitive advantage relative to other players in the industry.\nProducts and Services\nWe provide a wide spectrum of products and services including dampers and diverters, selective catalytic reduction and selective non-catalytic reduction systems, cyclonic technology, thermal oxidizers, filtration systems, scrubbers, fluid handling equipment and plant engineering services and engineered design build fabrication. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, speed of delivery, quality, customer support and single source.\nProject Design and Research and Development\nWe seek to achieve our Outside-In Leadership by understanding our customers\u2019 needs and delivering better outcomes for them by focusing new product development efforts that help protect our shared environment while working to improve a variety of operational outcomes including, but not limited to, facility uptime, production quality, employee safety, equipment protection and process performance. We produce specialized products that are often tailored to the specifications of a customer or application.\nWe continually collaborate with our customers on their projects to develop the proper solution and ensure customer satisfaction. The project development cycle may follow many different paths depending on the specifics of the job and end market. The cycle can take from one to more than twelve months from concept and design to production but may vary significantly depending on developments that occur during the process, including among others, the emergence of new environmental demands, changes in design specifications and ability to obtain necessary approvals.\nSales, Marketing and Support\nOur global selling strategy is to provide a solutions-based approach by being a single source provider of technology products and services. The strategy involves expanding our scope of products and services through selective acquisitions and the formation and integration of new business units. We believe this strategy provides a discernible competitive advantage. We execute this strategy by utilizing our portfolio of in-house technologies and those of third-party equipment suppliers. Many of these have been long-standing relationships, which have evolved from pure supplier roles to value-added business partnerships. This enables us to leverage existing business with selective alliances of suppliers and application specific engineering expertise. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, speed of delivery, quality, customer support, and single source. Our value proposition to customers is to provide competitively priced, customized solutions. Our industry-specific knowledge, accompanied by our product and service offerings, provides valuable synergies for design innovation.\nWe sell and market our products and services with our own direct sales force, including employees in the United States, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Canada, United Arab Emirates, India, Mexico, China, and Singapore, in conjunction with outside sales representatives in North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, Asia, and India. We expect to continue expanding our sales and support capabilities and our network of outside sales representatives in key regions domestically and internationally.\nWe market our offerings to our customers through a variety of channels including, but not limited to, digital, web, social media, email campaigns, individual customer visits, product announcements, brochures, magazine articles, advertisements and cover or article features in trade journals and other publications. We also participate in public relations and promotional events, including industry tradeshows and technical conferences.\nOur customer service organization or sales force provides our customers with technical assistance, use and maintenance information as well as other key information regarding their purchase. We also actively provide our customers with access to key information regarding changes and pending changes in environmental regulations as well as new product or service developments. We believe that maintaining a close relationship with our customers and providing them with the support they request improves their level of satisfaction and enables us to foresee their potential future product needs or service demands. Moreover, this approach can lead to sales of annual service and support contracts as well as consumables. Our website also provides our customers with online tools and technical resources.\nQuality Assurance\nIn engineered systems, quality is defined as system performance. We review with our customers, before the contract is signed, the technical specification and the efficiency of the equipment that will be customized to meet their specific needs. We then review these same parameters internally to assure that warranties will be met. Standard project management and production management tools are used to help ensure that all work is done to specification and that project schedules are met. Equipment is tested at the site to ensure it is functioning properly.\nCustomers\nWe are not dependent upon any single customer, and no customer comprised 10% or more of our consolidated revenues for 2020.\nSuppliers and Subcontractors\nWe purchase our raw materials and supplies from a variety of global sources. When possible, we directly secure angle iron and sheet plate products from steel mills, whereas other materials are purchased from a variety of steel service centers. Steel prices have traditionally been volatile, but we typically mitigate the risk of higher prices by including a \u201csurcharge\u201d on our standard products. On contract work, we mitigate the risk of higher prices by including the current price in our estimate and generally include price inflation clauses for protection.\nWe believe we have a good relationship with our suppliers and do not anticipate any difficulty in continuing to purchase such items on terms acceptable to us. We have not experienced difficulty in procuring a sufficient supply of materials in the past. To the extent that our current suppliers are unable or unwilling to continue to supply us with materials, we believe that we would be able to obtain such materials from other suppliers on acceptable terms.\nTypically, on turnkey projects, we subcontract manufacturing, electrical work, concrete work, controls, conveyors and insulation. We use subcontractors with whom we have good working relationships and review each project at the beginning and on an ongoing basis to help ensure that all work is being done according to our specifications. Subcontractors are generally paid when we are paid by our customers according to the terms of our contract with the customer. The Company\u2019s asset-light business model focuses on effective management of subcontractors, which allows the Company to achieve targeted working capital levels through reduction in certain assets and reduced capital expenditures.\nBacklog\nBacklog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services for which control has not yet transferred to the customer. Backlog was $183.1 million as of December 31, 2020 as compared to $216.6 million as of December 31, 2019, $9.8 million of backlog in total was acquired from the Environmental Integrated Solutions (\u201cEIS\u201d) acquisition and the Mader Holding L.P. (\u201cMader\u201d) joint venture. In addition, the Company removed $9.2 million of orders in 2020 that were previously disclosed as backlog in prior periods, due to cancellations by industrial customers with exposure to aerospace end markets. Backlog is adjusted on a quarterly basis for adjustments in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all backlog is expected to be delivered within 12 to 18 months. Backlog is not defined by United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and our methodology for calculating backlog may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies.\nCompetition\nThe markets we serve are highly fragmented with numerous small and regional participants. We believe no single company competes with us across the full range of our systems and products. Competition in the markets we serve is based on a number of considerations, including timeliness of delivery, technology, applications experience, know-how, reputation, product warranties, service and price. Demand for our product can vary period over period depending on conditions in the markets we serve. We believe our product quality,\nreliability, on-time delivery and safety supported by advanced engineering and operational excellence differentiate us from many of our competitors, including those competitors who often offer products at a lower price.\nDue to the size and shipping weight of many of our projects, localized manufacturing/fabrication capabilities are very important to our customers. As a result, competition varies widely by region and industry. The market for our engineered products is reasonably competitive and is characterized by technological change, continuously changing environmental regulations, and evolving customer requirements. We believe that the additional competitive factors in our markets include:\n\u2022\nperformance track record;\n\u2022\ncomprehensive portfolio of products with leading technology;\n\u2022\nbrand recognition;\n\u2022\nhigh design standard;\n\u2022\nquality and reliable solutions;\n\u2022\non-time delivery;\n\u2022\nquality customer service and support; and\n\u2022\nfinancial and operational stability, including reputation.\nWe believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors.\nGovernment Regulations\nWe believe our operations are in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We believe that changes in environmental laws and regulations create opportunity given the nature of our business.\nOur business is subject to numerous laws and regulations. We expect that the change in administration at the federal level will result in an increase in federal regulations applicable to our business. While there are not currently regulations proposed or pending that we believe will result in material capital, operating or other costs to the business at this time, such regulations could be proposed and/or passed into law in 2021 or beyond. Other regulations currently in place could be withdrawn and replaced with more stringent requirements in 2021 or beyond. New laws and regulations and the costs of compliance with such new laws and regulations can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined through regulatory guidance and enforcement.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, employee and third-party nondisclosure/confidentiality agreements and license agreements to protect our intellectual property. We sell most of our products under a number of registered trade names, brand names and registered trademarks, which we believe are widely recognized in the industry. While we hold patents within a number of our businesses, we do not view our patents to be material to our business.\nCommitment to Values and Ethics\nAt CECO, we act in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (\u201cCode of Conduct\u201d), which sets forth expectations and guidance for employees to make appropriate decisions. Our Code of Conduct covers topics such as anti-corruption, discrimination, harassment, data privacy, appropriate use of company assets, protecting confidential information, and reporting Code of Conduct violations. The Code of Conduct reflects our commitment to operating in a fair, honest, responsible and ethical manner and also provides direction for reporting complaints in the event of alleged violations of our policies ,including through an anonymous helpline. Our executive officers and managers maintain an \u201copen door\u201d policy, and any form of retaliation is strictly prohibited.\nHuman Capital Management\nCECO recognizes that in order to drive innovation and operational excellence, we must identify, attract, retain and motivate world-class talent. As of December 31, 2020, CECO has approximately 730 employees, across seven countries. One-hundred and fifty of our US employees are unionized in our Pennsylvania, Tennessee and North Carolina facilities.\nTalent, Leadership and People Development\nTo support personal and professional development, we have strategically committed resources to leadership and management development programs, product knowledge, job skills, and compliance training. In 2020, CECO implemented an online learning platform so our employees could continue to enhance their skill sets and knowledge while working remotely due to COVID-19. Our learning platform offers over 16,000 courses and certifications ranging from job function to leadership and resource training. As of December 31, 2020, 72% of CECO\u2019s global workforce registered and engaged with this learning platform. We believe this investment in our team members results in a more knowledgeable and competent workforce while strengthening the commitment between employees and our company.\nWe provide a variety of resources to help our employees grow in their current roles and build new skills to thrive in the workplace of the future. Strategic talent reviews are conducted annually across all business areas. The Board is updated on the Company\u2019s people strategy on an annual basis, which is refined based on business drivers, market factors and key initiatives designed to drive the corporate strategy and business results, and meets to review our succession planning strategy and leadership pipeline for key roles, taking into account the company\u2019s long-term strategy.\nHealth and Safety\nAt CECO, the health and safety of our employees is one of our highest priorities. We believe that all injuries, occupational illnesses and incidents are preventable, and we are committed to operating with a zero-incident culture. Through our environmental, health and safety program we implement policies and training programs, as well as perform self-audits to ensure our colleagues leave the workplace safely every day. To better understand employee safety at the site level, we have implemented safety committees and developed safety scorecards to share best practices between sites. We currently share scorecard information monthly to foster visibility, accountability and commitment across our workplace, communicating and celebrating successful results across the enterprise. In addition to lagging indicators, such as injury performance, the scorecards highlight leading indicators such as safety observations and near-misses, as well as other proactive actions taken at each site to ensure worker safety. For the year ended December 31, 2020, CECO\u2019s domestic Total Recordable Incident Rate (\u201cTRIR\u201d) was 1.9% as compared to our benchmark industry average TRIR of 4.5%.\nOur safety focus is also evident in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe. We implemented all government, federal and state policies, in addition to the following policies and procedures:\n\u2022\nadded work from home flexibility for office job roles;\n\u2022\ndeployed Microsoft Teams world-wide to enable collaboration while ensuring team safety;\n\u2022\nimplemented an Emergency Paid Pandemic Leave policy to encourage those who are sick to stay home;\n\u2022\nincreased cleaning protocols across all locations;\n\u2022\ninitiated regular communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures;\n\u2022\nimplemented a self-certification health assessment for all employees, partners and vendors at our manufacturing facilities (where allowed by local law);\n\u2022\nestablished new physical distancing procedures for employees who need to be onsite;\n\u2022\nprovided additional personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies;\n\u2022\nimplemented safety protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure;\n\u2022\nprohibited all non-essential domestic and international travel for all employees;\n\u2022\nrequired masks to be worn in all locations where allowed by local law;\n\u2022\nrequired on site visitors complete a health and travel declaration; and\n\u2022\nfor on site visitors traveling by plane, required a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction test before entering the facility.\nCECO manufactures products and performs services deemed essential to critical infrastructure, including manufacturing, and energy, and, as a result, our facilities have continued operating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, during 2020, our experience and\ncontinuing focus on workplace safety have enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our colleagues and workplace visitors safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDiversity, Equity, and an Inclusive Culture\nAt CECO we believe a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to inspiring innovative thinking, creative problem-solving, performance, and results, so we cultivate an environment where team members feel valued, engaged, and inspired to give their best. The unique characteristics that shape each individual help inform our decisions as a company, and this mindset allows CECO to realize new opportunities and add value to our customers, partners, and stockholders.\nAs part of our efforts to expand CECO\u2019s diverse workforce, we are:\n\u2022\ninitiating recruitment efforts to attract and build a more diverse workforce, including expanding career opportunity postings on career websites to diverse job boards, as well as, search engines that aggregate and display job openings by employers, including those dedicated to diverse candidates;\n\u2022\nimplementing training to raise awareness of unconscious bias and further promote personal and professional development; and\n\u2022\nlaunching pulse surveys to foster ongoing feedback around our culture, workplace inclusiveness and communications.\nCECO\u2019s commitment to expanding our diverse workforce and enhancing our inclusive culture is driven by our recognition that a workplace that is reflective of our global customer base establishes a firm foundation to drive creativity and innovation, which lead to problem solving, development, performance, and business success.\nAppointment of Chief Executive Officer\nOn July 6, 2020, Mr. Todd Gleason started serving as Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, succeeding Dennis Sadlowski.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors described below, together with the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before you decide to invest in our securities. The risks described below are the material risks of which we are currently aware; however, they may not be the only risks that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also impair our business. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. If any of these risks develop into actual events, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the trading price of your shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nCOVID-19 Risks\nWe face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The continued spread of COVID-19 has reached geographic areas in which we have operations, suppliers, customers and employees. We expect the continued spread of COVID-19 to continue to have a significant impact on our business, and may affect the demand for our products and disrupt our supply chain and the manufacturing and distribution of our products. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue and such events may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe continuing spread of COVID-19 has caused volatility, severe market dislocations and liquidity constraints in many markets. Several countries, including the United States, have taken steps to restrict travel, temporarily close businesses and issue quarantine orders, and it remains unclear how long such measures will remain in place or whether efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 will continue to intensify. The foregoing could lead to a significant economic downturn or recession, increased market volatility, a greater number of market closures, higher default rates and adverse effects on the values and liquidity of securities or other assets. Such impacts may adversely affect the Company and your investment in the Company.\nThe ultimate effect that COVID-19 may have on our operating and financial results is not presently known to us or may present unanticipated risks that cannot be determined at this time.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business may be adversely affected by global economic conditions.\nA national or global economic downturn or credit crisis may have a significant negative impact on our financial condition, future results of operations and cash flows. Specific risk factors related to these overall economic and credit conditions include the following:\n\u2022\nthe impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on global capital markets;\n\u2022\ncustomers or potential customers may reduce or delay their procurement or new product development;\n\u2022\nkey suppliers may become insolvent resulting in delays for our material purchases;\n\u2022\nvendors and other third parties may fail to perform their contractual obligations;\n\u2022\ncustomers may be unable to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and services;\n\u2022\nand certain customers may become insolvent.\nThese risk factors could reduce our product sales, increase our operating costs, impact our ability to collect customer receivables, lengthen our cash conversion cycle and increase our need for cash, which would ultimately decrease our profitability and negatively impact our financial condition. They could also limit our ability to expand through acquisitions due to the tightening of the credit markets.\nOur dependence upon fixed-price contracts could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe majority of our projects are currently performed on a fixed-price basis, while a limited number of projects are currently performed on a time and materials basis. Under a fixed-price contract, we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project, based upon a defined scope, which includes specific assumptions and project criteria. If our estimates of the costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we incur, our margins will decrease, or we may incur a loss. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized on\na fixed-price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic. While our fixed-price contracts are typically not individually material to our operating results, if we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks, we may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and incur reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending on the size of a project, these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results. In general, turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixed-price basis involve an increased risk of significant variations. Generally, our contracts and projects vary in length, depending on the size and complexity of the project, project owner demands and other factors. The foregoing risks are exacerbated for projects with longer-term durations and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract.\nAccounting for contract revenue may result in material adjustments that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from fixed price contracts. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. A significant amount of our revenue within the Energy Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments is recognized over a period of time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Progress is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation. For these contracts, the cost-to-cost measure best depicts the continuous transfer of goods or services to the customer.\nContract revenue and total direct cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses and as change orders are approved, and adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the period when these estimates are revised. These estimates are based on management\u2019s reasonable assumptions and our historical experience, and are only estimates. Variation of actual results from these assumptions, which are outside the control of management and can differ from our historical experience, including for reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic, could be material. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or the elimination of previously reported contract revenue, we would recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.\nOur inability to deliver our backlog on time could affect our future sales and profitability, and our relationships with our customers.\nOur backlog was $183.0 million at December 31, 2020 and $216.6 million at December 31, 2019. Our ability to meet customer delivery schedules for our backlog is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, access to the raw materials required for production, an adequately trained and capable workforce, project engineering expertise for certain large projects, sufficient internal manufacturing plant capacity, available subcontractors and appropriate planning and scheduling of manufacturing resources. Our failure to deliver in accordance with customer expectations may result in damage to existing customer relationships and result in the loss of future business. Failure to deliver backlog in accordance with expectations could negatively impact our financial performance and cause adverse changes in the market price of our common stock.\nVolatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services.\nVolatility in oil and natural gas prices can impact our customers\u2019 activity levels and spending for our products and services. Current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund capital expenditures. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted demand for and expectations about future prices and price volatility, which are important for determining our customers future spending levels. Lower oil and natural gas prices generally lead to decreased spending by our customers. While higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers, sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth, and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers. Our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is a higher perceived risk. Any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nOur financial performance may vary significantly from period to period.\nOur annual revenues and earnings have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future. Our contracts generally stipulate customer specific delivery terms and may have contract cycles of a year or more, which subjects these contracts to many factors beyond our control. In addition, contracts that are significantly larger in size than our typical contracts tend to intensify their impact on our annual operating results. Furthermore, as a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed, an unanticipated decrease in our revenues, a delay or cancellation of orders in backlog, or a decrease in the demand for our products, may have a significant impact on\nour annual operating results. Therefore, our annual operating results may be subject to significant variations and our operating performance in one period may not be indicative of our future performance.\nCustomers may cancel or delay projects. As a result, our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenue.\nCustomers may cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond our control, including for reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our orders normally contain cancellation provisions that permit us to recover our costs, and, for most contracts, a portion of our anticipated profit in the event a customer cancels an order. If a customer elects to cancel an order, we may not realize the full amount of revenues included in our backlog. If projects are delayed, the timing of our revenues could be affected and projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time. Revenue recognition occurs over long periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays. If we receive relatively large orders in any given quarter, fluctuations in the levels of our quarterly backlog can result because the backlog in that quarter may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent quarters. As a result, our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenues. With rare exceptions, we are not issued contracts until a customer is ready to start work on a project. Thus, it is our experience that the only relationship between the length of a project and the possibility that a project may be cancelled is simply the fact that there is more time involved. In a year-long project as opposed to a three-month project, more time is available for the customer to experience a softening in its business, which may cause the customer to cancel a project.\nWe face significant competition in the markets we serve.\nAll of the industries in which we compete are highly competitive and highly fragmented. We compete in primarily mature markets against a number of local, regional and national contractors and manufacturers in each of our product or service lines, many of which have been in existence longer than us and some of which have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, speed of delivery, quality, customer support and single source. We must also be responsive to any technological developments and related changing customer requirements. Any failure by us to compete effectively in the markets we serve could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur material costs as a result of existing or future product liability claims, or other claims and litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; and our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or may be insufficient to cover the claims.\nDespite our quality assurance measures, we may be exposed to product liability claims, other claims and litigation in the event that the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage or our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected. Such claims may also be accompanied by fraud and deceptive trade practices claims. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability and other claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability and other claims. Furthermore, our insurance may not cover damages from breach of contract by us or based on alleged fraud or deceptive trade practices. Any future damages that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, product liability and other claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.\nAn unsuccessful defense of a product liability or other claim could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.\nLiability to customers under warranties may adversely affect our reputation, our ability to obtain future business and our results of operations.\nWe provide certain warranties as to the proper operation and conformance to specifications of the products we manufacture or produce. Failure of our products to operate properly or to meet specifications may increase our costs by requiring additional engineering resources and services, replacement of parts and equipment or monetary reimbursement to customers. We have in the past received warranty claims, are currently subject to warranty claims, and we expect to continue to receive claims in the future. To the extent that we incur substantial warranty claims in any period, our reputation, our ability to obtain future business and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIncreasing costs for manufactured components, raw materials, transportation, health care and energy prices may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe use a broad range of manufactured components and raw materials in our products, including raw steel, steel-related components, filtration media, and equipment such as fans and motors. Materials and subcontracting costs comprise the largest components of our total costs. Further increases in the price of these items could further materially increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect our profit margins. Similarly, transportation, steel and health care costs have risen steadily over the past few years and represent an increasing burden for us. Although we try to contain these costs whenever possible, and although we try to pass along increased costs in the form of price increases to our customers, we may be unsuccessful in doing so, and even when successful, the timing of such price increases may lag significantly behind our incurrence of higher costs.\nRisks Related to our Business Model and Capital Structure\nOur gross margins are affected by shifts in our product mix.\nCertain of our products have higher gross profit margins than others. Consequently, changes in the product mix of our sales from quarter-to-quarter or from year-to-year can have a significant impact on our reported gross profit margins. Certain of our products also have a much higher internally manufactured cost component. Therefore, changes from quarter-to-quarter or from year-to-year can have a significant impact on our reported gross margins. In addition, contracts with a higher percentage of subcontracted work or equipment purchases may result in lower gross profit margins.\nOur manufacturing operations are dependent on third-party suppliers.\nAlthough we are not dependent on any one supplier, we are dependent on the ability of our third-party suppliers to supply our raw materials, as well as certain specific component parts. The third-party suppliers upon which we depend may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, loss of key personnel, or other reasons. For example, as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19 and government mandated shutdowns, we have noticed our suppliers are experiencing delays in the production or an inability to perform work. We cannot assure you that our third-party suppliers will dedicate sufficient resources to meet our scheduled delivery requirements or that our suppliers will have sufficient resources to satisfy our requirements during any period of sustained demand, and the global nature of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in there being fewer alternative suppliers. Failure of suppliers to supply, or delays in supplying, our raw materials or certain components, or allocations in the supply of certain high demand raw components, for any reason, including, without limitation, disruptions in our suppliers\u2019 due to cybersecurity incidents, terrorist activity, public health crises (such as COVID-19), fires or other natural disasters could materially adversely affect our operations and ability to meet our own delivery schedules on a timely and competitive basis. Additionally, our third-party suppliers may provide us with raw materials or component parts that fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of our customers, which could subject us to product liability claims, other claims and litigation.\nOur use of subcontractors could potentially harm our profitability and business reputation.\nOccasionally we act as a prime contractor in some of the engineered projects we undertake. In our capacity as lead provider and when acting as a prime contractor, we perform a portion of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract activities such as manufacturing, electrical work, concrete work, insulation, conveyors and controls. In our industry, the lead contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract, including subcontract work. Thus, when acting as a prime contractor, we are subject to risk associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated.\nMoreover, the outbreak and preventative or protective actions that governments, corporations, individuals or we may take to contain COVID-19 have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a period of reduced operations and business disruption for our subcontractors. The outbreak of COVID-19 and related actions also have prevented, and may continue to prevent, our subcontractors from meeting their obligations to us, which could also contribute to performance delays on our customer obligations and increase our costs. Any costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance.\nWe employ subcontractors at various locations around the world to meet our customers\u2019 needs in a timely manner, meet local content requirements and reduce costs. Subcontractors generally perform the majority of our manufacturing for international customers. We also utilize subcontractors in North America. The use of subcontractors decreases our control over the performance of these functions and could result in project delays, escalated costs and substandard quality. These risks could adversely affect our profitability and business reputation. In addition, many of our competitors, who have greater financial resources and greater bargaining power than we have, use the same subcontractors that we use and could potentially influence our ability to hire these subcontractors. If we were to lose relationships with key subcontractors, our business could be adversely impacted.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the progress of construction projects across the globe and will likely continue to cause delays and disruptions. If projects are delayed or cancelled it could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our accounts receivable are related to larger contracts, which increases our exposure to credit risk.\nSignificant portions of our sales are to customers who place large orders for custom products and whose activities are related to the power and oil & gas industries. As a result, our exposure to credit risk is affected to some degree by conditions within these industries and governmental and or political conditions. We frequently attempt to reduce our exposure to credit risk by requiring progress or milestone payments and letters of credit as well as closely monitoring the credit worthiness of our customers. However, the continuing economic climate and other unanticipated events that affect our customers could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results. Further, we believe that the outbreak and worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact our sales.\nChanges in billing terms can increase our exposure to working capital and credit risk.\nOur products are generally sold under contracts that allow us to bill upon the completion of certain agreed upon milestones or upon actual shipment of the product, and certain contracts include a retention provision. We attempt to negotiate progress-billing milestones on all large contracts to help us manage the working capital and credit risk associated with these large contracts. Consequently, shifts in the billing terms of the contracts in our backlog from period to period can increase our requirement for working capital and can increase our exposure to credit risk.\nCurrency fluctuations may reduce profits on our foreign sales or increase our costs, either of which could adversely affect our financial results.\nGiven that approximately 35% of our 2020 revenues are outside the United States, we are subject to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in foreign currencies. Our sales and profitability are impacted by the movement of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in the countries in which we generate sales and conduct operations. Long-term fluctuations in relative currency values could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial conditions.\nIf our goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles become impaired, we may be required to recognize charges that would adversely impact our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles were $174.8 million, or 41.7%, of our total assets. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are subject to annual impairment evaluations (or more frequently if circumstances require). Major factors that influence our evaluations are estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the specific intangible asset or the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides. This is the most sensitive of our estimates related to our evaluations. Other factors considered in our evaluations include assumptions as to the business climate, industry and economic conditions. These assumptions are subjective and different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our analyses. While management, based on current forecasts and outlooks, believes that the assumptions and estimates are reasonable, we can make no assurances that future actual operating results will be realized as planned and that there will not be material impairment charges as a result. In particular, an economic downturn could have a material adverse impact on our customers thereby forcing them to reduce or curtail doing business with us and such a result may materially affect the amount of cash flow generated by our future operations. Any write-down of goodwill or intangible assets resulting from future periodic evaluations could adversely materially impact our results of operations.\nWe may incur costs as a result of certain restructuring activities, which may negatively impact our financial results, and we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans.\nWe are continuously seeking the most cost-effective means and structure to serve our customers, protect our stockholders and respond to changes in our markets. From time to time, we may engage in restructuring activities in an effort to improve cost competitiveness and profitability. We may not achieve the desired or anticipated benefits from these restructuring activities. As a result, restructuring costs may vary significantly from year to year depending on the scope of such activities. Such restructuring costs and expenses could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe are party to asbestos-containing product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur subsidiary, Met-Pro, along with numerous other third parties, has been named as a defendant in asbestos-related lawsuits filed against a large number of industrial companies including, in particular, those in the pump and fluid handling industries. In management\u2019s opinion, the complaints typically have been vague, general and speculative, alleging that Met-Pro, along with the numerous other defendants, sold unidentified asbestos-containing products and engaged in other related actions that caused injuries (including death) and loss to the plaintiffs. The Company\u2019s insurers have hired attorneys who, together with the Company, are vigorously defending these cases. The Company believes that its insurance coverage is adequate for the cases currently pending against the Company and for the foreseeable future, assuming a continuation of the current volume, nature of cases and settlement amounts. However, the Company has no control over the number and nature of cases that are filed against it, nor as to the financial health of its insurers or their position as to coverage. The Company also presently believes that none of the pending cases will have a material adverse impact upon the Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.\nSee Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding the asbestos-related litigation in which we are involved.\nWe have $74.0 million of indebtedness as of December 31, 2020, and incurrence of additional indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants, make payments on our debt and limit our growth.\nOur outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences for investors, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the agreement governing our Credit Facility (as defined herein), and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of the agreements governing any additional indebtedness, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under such agreements;\n\u2022\nthe covenants contained in our debt agreements, including our Credit Facility, limit our ability to borrow money in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate obligations;\n\u2022\nthe amount of our interest expense may increase because a substantial portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which, if interest rates increase, could result in higher interest expense;\n\u2022\nwe may need to use a portion of our cash flows to pay interest on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money we have for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities;\n\u2022\nwe may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general; and\n\u2022\nour debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors. We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our existing or future debt and meet our other obligations. Moreover, we currently expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact our cash flow and liquidity. If we do not have enough money to service our existing or future debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing or future debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to refinance our existing or future debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all, particularly in light of COVID-19\u2019s impact on capital markets.\nWe might be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and our products could infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could expose us to costly disputes.\nAlthough we believe that our products do not infringe patents or violate the proprietary rights of others, it is possible that our existing patent rights may not be valid or that infringement of existing or future patents or proprietary rights may occur. In the event our products infringe patents or proprietary rights of others, we may be required to modify the design of our products or obtain a license for certain technology. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in a timely manner, upon acceptable terms and conditions, or at all. Failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon our business. Moreover, if our products infringe patents or proprietary rights of others, we could, under certain circumstances, become liable for damages, which also could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks related to our pension plan may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.\nSignificant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors may adversely affect our results of operations and pension plan contributions in future periods. GAAP requires that we calculate the income or expense of our plan using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates. We establish the discount rate used to determine the present value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the end of each year based upon the available market rates for high quality, fixed-income investments. An increase in the discount rate would increase future pension expense and, conversely, a decrease in the discount rate would decrease future pension expense. Funding requirements for our pension plan may become more significant. The ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. For a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to estimate pension expense, including discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies, see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nWe may be subject to substantial withdrawal liability assessments in the future related to multiemployer pension plans to which certain of our subsidiaries make contributions pursuant to collective bargaining agreements.\nUnder applicable federal law, any employer contributing to a multiemployer pension plan that completely ceases participating in the plan while the plan is underfunded is subject to payment of such employer\u2019s assessed share of the aggregate unfunded vested benefits of the plan. In certain circumstances, an employer can be assessed a withdrawal liability for a partial withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan. If any of these adverse events were to occur in the future, it could result in a substantial withdrawal liability assessment that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have made and may make future acquisitions or divestitures, which involve numerous risks that could impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operating strategy has involved expanding or contracting our scope of products and services through selective acquisitions or divestitures and the formation or elimination of new business units that are then integrated or separated into or out of our family of turnkey system providers. We have acquired other businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies that are complementary to our business. We may be unable to find or consummate future acquisitions at acceptable prices and terms. We continually evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in the ordinary course of business.\nAlthough we conduct what we believe to be a prudent level of investigation regarding the operating and financial condition of the businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies we purchase, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding their actual operating and financial condition. Until we actually assume operating control of these businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies, we may not be able to ascertain their actual value or understand potential liabilities. This is particularly true with respect to acquisitions outside the United States.\nIn addition, acquisitions of businesses may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership. Our Credit Facility contains certain covenants that limit, or which may have the effect of limiting, among other things, acquisitions, capital expenditures, the sale of assets and the incurrence of additional indebtedness.\nOur ability to obtain financing for future growth opportunities may be limited.\nOur ability to execute our growth strategies may be limited by our ability to secure and retain additional financing on terms reasonably acceptable to us or at all. Certain of our competitors are larger companies that may have greater access to capital, and therefore, may have a competitive advantage over us should our access to capital be limited.\nRisks Related to Human Capital Management\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees.\nOur future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive, and competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire, and to varying degrees have been successful in hiring, our employees, including by establishing local offices near our headquarters. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed.\nWork stoppages or similar difficulties could significantly disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 150 of our approximately 730 employees are represented by international or independent labor unions under various union contracts that expire from June 30, 2021 to May 31, 2023. It is possible that our workforce will become more unionized in the future. Although we consider our employee relations to generally be good, our existing labor agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at one or more of our facilities in the future and we may be affected by other labor disputes. A work stoppage at one or more of our facilities may have a material adverse effect on our business. Unionization activities could also increase our costs, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nAdditionally, a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available. Work stoppages by employees of our customers also could result in reduced demand for our products.\nInformation Technology and Cyber Security Risks\nOur dependence on information systems and the failure of such systems, could significantly disrupt our business and negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are highly dependent on information systems that are increasingly operated by third-parties and as a result we have a limited ability to ensure their continued operation. We rely on information technology systems, networks and infrastructure in managing our day-to-day operations. In the event of systems failure or interruption, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will have limited ability to affect the timing and success of systems restoration. Any failure or interruption of our systems could cause delays or other problems in the delivery of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIncreased information technology cyber security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, and products.\nIncreased global information technology cyber security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and communications. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks and products remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information and communications, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. We have cybersecurity insurance related to a breach event covering expenses for notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations and legal advice. However, damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or exceed the amount of any insurance available, or may result in increased cybersecurity and other insurance premiums. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and an increased reliance on our information technology systems, we have taken proactive measures to strengthen our information technology systems, including completing a National Institute of Standards and Technology (\u201cNIST\u201d) assessment, upgrading of security patches across all servers, development of best-in-class hack protection service, implemented recurring company wide security training and enablement of advanced security for our major information systems.\nIn addition, we could be subject to legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties if confidential information relating to our employees or other parties is misappropriated from our systems and networks.\nRegulatory Compliance and International Operations Risks\nOur business can be significantly affected by changes in regulatory standards.\nThe markets that the Company serves are characterized by competitively imposed process standards and regulatory requirements, each of which influences the demand for our products and services. Changes in legislative, regulatory or industrial requirements may render certain of our products and processes obsolete. Conversely, these changes may present new business opportunities for us. Acceptance of new products and services may also be affected by the adoption of new government regulations requiring stricter standards. Our ability to anticipate changes in regulatory standards and to respond with new and enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and to remain competitive. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive or that certain of our products or services will not become obsolete.\nChanges in current environmental legislation and enforcement could have an adverse impact on the sale of our environmental control systems and products and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is primarily driven by capital spending, clean air rules, plant upgrades by our customers to comply with laws and regulations governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment or human health. These laws include, but are not limited to, United States federal statues such as Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, and the regulations implementing these statutes, as well as similar laws and regulations at state and local levels and in other countries. These United States laws and regulations may change and other countries may not adopt similar laws and regulations. Our business may be adversely impacted to the extent that environmental regulations are repealed, amended, implementation dates are delayed, or to the extent that regulatory authorities reduce enforcement.\nOur operations outside of the United States are subject to political, investment and local business risks.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 35% of our total revenue was derived from products or services ultimately delivered or provided to end users outside the United States. As part of our operating strategy, we intend to expand our international operations through internal growth and selected acquisitions. Operations outside of the United States, particularly in emerging markets, are subject to a variety of risks that are different from or are in addition to the risks we face within the United States. Among others, these risks include: (i) local, economic, political and social conditions, including potential hyperinflationary conditions and political instability in certain countries; (ii) tax-related risks, including the imposition of taxes and the lack of beneficial treaties, that result in higher effective tax rate for us; (iii) imposition of limitations on the remittance of dividends and payments by foreign subsidiaries; (iv) difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign local systems; (v) domestic and foreign customs, tariffs and quotas or other trade barriers; (vi) risk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments; (vii) managing and obtaining support and distribution channels for overseas operations; (viii) hiring and retaining qualified management personnel for our overseas operations; (ix) the results of the United Kingdom\u2019s referendum on European Union membership, advising for the exit from the European Union; and (x) the effects of COVID-19 and the extent to which the outbreak may disrupt global capital markets, supply chains, and/or our foreign operations.\nWe are also exposed to risks relating to U.S. policy with respect to companies doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on import from countries where we procure or manufacture products, such as China, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For instance, the U.S. and Chinese governments have imposed a series of significant incremental retaliatory tariffs to certain imported goods. Given the uncertainty regarding the duration of the imposed tariffs, as well as the potential for additional tariffs by the U.S., China or other countries, as well as other changes in tax policy, trade regulations or trade agreements, and the Company\u2019s ability to implement strategies to mitigate the impact of changes in tax policy, tariffs or other trade regulations, our exposure to the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, compliance with foreign and domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including import, export, defense regulations and foreign exchange controls and anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom\u2019s Bribery Act, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulations and similar laws of other jurisdictions, could adversely impact our ability to compete against companies in such jurisdictions. Moreover, the violation of such laws or regulations, by us or our representatives, could result in severe penalties including monetary fines, criminal proceedings and suspension of export privileges. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable\nfor such violations, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including loss of export privileges or authorization needed to conduct aspects of our international business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe occurrence of one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or upon our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.\nNew laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In particular, there may be significant changes in U.S. laws and regulations and existing international trade agreements by the current U.S. presidential administration that could affect a wide variety of industries and businesses, including those businesses we own and operate. If the current or future U.S. presidential administrations materially modifies U.S. laws and regulations and international trade agreements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance and investors may not be able to resell shares they purchase at their purchase price.\nThe stock market has experienced and may in the future experience volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, substantial volatility. During 2020, the sales price of our common stock on the NASDAQ ranged from $3.53 to $9.00 per share. We expect our common stock to continue to be subject to fluctuations. Broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Factors that could cause fluctuation in the common stock price may include, among other things:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nadverse general economic conditions, including, but not limited to, withdrawals of investments in the stock markets generally or a tightening of credit available to potential acquirers of businesses, that result in lower average prices being paid for public company shares and lower valuations being placed on businesses;\n\u2022\nother domestic and international macroeconomic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nhealth epidemics and other outbreaks, including the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nour failure to meet the expectations of the investment community;\n\u2022\nindustry trends and the business success of our customers;\n\u2022\nloss of key customers;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological advances by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ncurrent events affecting the political and economic environment in the United States;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in our industry, including demand for our products and services, technological advances and governmental regulations;\n\u2022\nlitigation or other proceedings involving or affecting us; and\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of our key personnel.\nThe realization of any of these risks and other factors beyond our control could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly.\nWe are not currently paying dividends and cannot make assurances that we will pay dividends on our common stock and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends.\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to our stockholders fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, as well as\napplicable legal, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. On November 6, 2017, the Board of Directors reviewed the Company\u2019s dividend policy and determined that it would be in the best interest of the stockholders to suspend dividend payments. Future dividends and the dividend policy may be changed at the Board of Director\u2019s discretion at any time. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future. Payment of dividends is also subject to the continuing compliance with our financial covenants under our Credit Facility.\nOur ability to issue preferred stock could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 10,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series on terms that may be determined at the time of issuance by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, we may issue shares of any series of preferred stock that would rank senior to our common stock as to voting or dividend rights or rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents have anti-takeover effects.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us. Such provisions, including those limiting who may call special stockholders\u2019 meetings, together with the possible issuance of our preferred stock without stockholder approval, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our Board of Directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of our common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder\u2019s best interest.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nFailure to maintain adequate internal controls could adversely affect our business.\nUnder Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, we are required to include in each of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, a report containing our management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and an attestation report of our independent auditor. These laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve and could become increasingly stringent in the future. We have undertaken actions to enhance our ability to comply with the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley, including, but not limited to, the engagement of consultants, the documentation of existing controls and the implementation of new controls or modification of existing controls as deemed appropriate.\nWe continue to devote substantial time and resources to the documentation and testing of our controls, and to plan for and the implementation of remedial efforts in those instances where remediation is indicated. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including remediating any material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended in the future, we could be subject to regulatory actions, civil or criminal penalties or stockholder litigation. In addition, failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We believe that the out-of-pocket costs, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from running our day-to-day operations and operational changes caused by the need to comply with the requirements of Section 404 will continue to be significant.\nThere are inherent limitations in all internal control systems over financial reporting, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWhile we continue to take action to ensure compliance with the internal control, disclosure control and other requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the SEC, there are inherent limitations in our ability to control all circumstances. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls can prevent all errors and all frauds. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be evaluated in relation to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nIf we are not able to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed. We can give no assurances that any additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting.",

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. We apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates.\nOverview\nBusiness Overview\nCECO is a global leader in industrial air quality and fluid handling serving the energy, industrial and other niche markets through an attractive asset-light business model. We focus on engineering, designing, building, and installing systems that capture, clean and destroy airborne contaminants from industrial facilities as well as equipment that controls emissions from such facilities, as well as fluid handling and filtration systems. CECO provides innovative technology and application expertise that helps companies grow their businesses with safe, clean, and more efficient solutions to help protect our shared environment.\nCECO serves diverse industries globally by working to improve air quality, optimize the energy value chain, and provide customized engineered solutions in our customers\u2019 mission critical applications. The industries CECO serves include power generation, petrochemical processing, general industrial, refining, oil & gas, electric vehicle production, poly silicon fabrication, battery recycling, and wastewater treatment, along with a wide range of other industries.\nCOVID-19\nOn January 30, 2020, the WHO announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) originating in Wuhan, China and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally beyond its point of origin. On March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. As of March 3, 2021, the virus continues to spread and has had a significant impact on worldwide economic activity and on macroeconomic conditions and the end markets of our business. Vaccine administration is underway, however new variants of COVID-19 continue to emerge. There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of vaccines and current tests and treatments with regard to the new variants. Several countries, including the United States, have taken steps to restrict travel, temporarily close businesses and issue quarantine orders, and it remains unclear how long such measures will remain in place or whether efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 will continue to intensify.\nWithin the United States, certain portions of our business have been designated an essential business, and we continue to operate our business in compliance with applicable state and local laws. This allows us to continue to serve our customers, however, the COVID-19 pandemic has also disrupted our global operations. Some of our facilities and our suppliers have experienced temporary disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict whether our facilities will experience more significant disruptions in the future or the impact on our suppliers.\nCECO has undertaken necessary measures in compliance with government directives to remain open across its business and continues to work closely with its global supply chain to proactively support customers during this critical time. As a key supplier to critical infrastructure projects, CECO has worked to maintain ongoing essential operations while observing recommended CDC guidelines to minimize the risk of spreading the COVID-19 virus including implementing, where possible, work-from-home procedures and additional sanitization efforts where facilities remain open to provide necessary services. Additionally, in 2020, CECO took several proactive cost reduction measures in response to the economic pressures brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, including: headcount reductions, lower discretionary spend, senior management team\u2019s temporary salary reduction, elimination or reduction of certain corporate-level costs, travel restrictions across all segments, and the Company implemented a number of furloughs which included, a rolling 2-week furlough of United States-based employees during the 6-week period beginning the week of April 6, 2020.\nThe senior management team meets regularly to review and assess the status of the Company's operations and the health and safety of its employees. The senior management team continues to monitor and manage the Company\u2019s ability to operate effectively and, to date, the Company has not experienced any significant disruptions within its supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notwithstanding the Company's continued efforts, COVID-19 has had and may have further negative impacts on its operations, customers and supply chain despite the preventative and precautionary measures being taken. COVID-19 began to impact the Company during the first quarter of 2020 and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve, and therefore, we cannot currently predict the extent to which our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity will ultimately be impacted.\nIndustry Trends and Corporate Strategy\nWe are a global corporation with worldwide operations. As a global business, our operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic factors, wherever we operate or do business. Our geographic and industry diversity, and the breadth of our product and services portfolios, have helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results.\nWe believe growth for our products and services is driven by the increasing demand for energy consumption and a shift towards cleaner sources such as natural gas, nuclear, and renewable sources. These trends should stimulate investment in new power generation facilities, pipeline expansion and related infrastructure, and in upgrading of existing facilities.\nWith a shift to cleaner, more environmentally responsible power generation, power providers and industrial power consumers are building new facilities that use cleaner fuels. In developed markets, natural gas is increasingly becoming one of the energy sources of choice. We supply product offerings throughout the entire natural gas infrastructure value chain and believe expansion will drive growth within our Energy Solutions segment for our pressure products and SCR systems for natural-gas-fired power plants. Increased global natural gas production as a percent of total energy consumption, miles of new pipeline being added globally, and an increase in liquification capacity all stand to drive the need for our products.\nWe also believe there is a trend in both developed and emerging markets to control and reduce emissions of harsher fuel sources for which our air pollution control equipment is required. In emerging markets including China, India, and South East Asia our business is positioned to benefit from tightening of air pollution standards. In developed markets, growth of industrialization will drive greater output of emissions requiring our equipment as well. In both markets, we expect capital expenditures for our equipment to increase and the need for our aftermarket services to grow as companies seek to meet new standards.\nWe continue to focus on increasing revenues and profitability globally while continuing to strengthen and expand our presence domestically. Our operating strategy has historically involved horizontally expanding our scope of technology, products, and services through selective acquisitions and the formation of new business units that are then vertically integrated into our growing group of turnkey system providers. Our continuing focus will be on global growth, market coverage, and expansion of our Asia operations. Operational excellence, margin expansion, after-market recurring revenue growth, and safety leadership are also critical to our growth strategy.\nOperations Overview\nWe operate using an \u201coutside-in\u201d customer approach to our business model. We are structured to win in target markets with a core focus on understanding customer needs. Our business model requires scalable efficiencies enabling us to serve our customers with a variety of products that we typically classify into three categories: make-to-order, configure-to-order, and engineer-to-order. We use an asset light model to accomplish this by focusing on application and technical expertise throughout our operations.\nThe Company\u2019s segments are led by presidents with distinct industry expertise coupled with strong leadership skills resulting in a customer-first mindset across the business. They manage their teams who are responsible for successfully running the segment operations. The segment presidents work closely with our Chief Executive Officer on global growth strategies, operational excellence, and employee development.\nWithin our segments we have monthly operating reviews to ensure we are both winning in the markets and winning as a business. These reviews include, but are not limited to, deal reviews, project reviews, and manufacturing reviews. Each of these reviews takes a customer-first approach where we adopt the metrics that matter most to our customer and to our stockholders. In these reviews we focus on metrics such as quality, customer satisfaction, on-time-delivery, lead-times, price, position, project margins, backlog, and above all, safety.\nThe headquarters focuses on enabling the core back-office key functions for scale and efficiency, that is, accounting, payroll, human resources/benefits, legal, information technology, marketing, safety support, internal control over financial reporting, and administration. We have excellent organizational focus from headquarters throughout our divisional businesses with clarity and minimal duplicative work streams.\nOur three reportable segments are:\n\u2022\nEnergy Solutions segment: Our Energy Solutions segment serves the Energy market, where we are a key part of helping meet the global demand for clean energy and lower emissions through our highly engineered and tailored emissions management, silencers and separation solutions and services. Our offerings improve air quality and solves fluid handling needs with market leading technologies, efficiently designed, and customized solutions for the power generation, oil & gas, and petrochemical industries.\n\u2022\nIndustrial Solutions segment: Our Industrial Solutions segment serves the Air Pollution Control market where our aim is to address the growing need to protect the air we breathe and help our customers\u2019 desires for sustainability upgrades beyond carbon footprint issues. Our offerings in clean air pollution control, collection and ventilation technologies improve air quality with a compelling solution that enable our customers in the semiconductor manufacturing, electric vehicle production, battery recycling, and wood manufacturing industries to reduce their carbon footprint, lower energy consumption, minimize waste and meet compliance targets for toxic emissions, fumes, volatile organic compounds, and industrial odors.\n\u2022\nFluid Handling Solutions segment: Our Fluid Handling Solutions segment offers unique pump and filtration solutions that maintain safe and clean operations in some of the most harsh and toxic environments. In this market, we provide solutions for mission-critical applications to a wide variety of industries including, but not limited to, plating and metal finishing, automotive, food and beverage, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, wastewater treatment, desalination and the aquarium & aquaculture markets.\nOur contracts are obtained either through competitive bidding or as a result of negotiations with our customers. Contract terms offered by us are generally dependent on the complexity and risk of the project as well as the resources that will be required to complete the project. Our focus is on increasing our operating margins as well as our gross margin percentage, which translates into stronger operating results.\nOur cost of sales is principally driven by a number of factors, including material and subcontract prices and labor cost and availability. Changes in these factors may have a material impact on our overall gross profit margins.\nWe break down costs of sales into five categories. They are:\n\u2022\nSubcontracts-Electrical work, concrete work, subcomponents and other subcontracts necessary to produce our products;\n\u2022\nLabor-Our direct labor both in the shop and in the field;\n\u2022\nMaterial-Raw material that we buy to build our products;\n\u2022\nEquipment-Fans, motors, control panels and other equipment necessary for turnkey systems; and\n\u2022\nFactory overhead-Costs of facilities and supervision wages necessary to produce our products.\nIn general, subcontracts provide us the most flexibility in margin followed by labor, material, and equipment. Across our various product lines, the relative relationships of these factors change and cause variations in gross margin percentage. Material costs have also increased faster than labor costs, which also reduces gross margin percentage. As material cost inflation occurs, the Company seeks to pass this cost onto our customers as price increases.\nSelling and administrative expense principally includes sales and engineering payroll and related fringes, advertising and marketing expenditures as well as all corporate and administrative functions and other costs that support our operations. The majority of these expenses are fixed. With our asset light model, we expect our operations to leverage our fixed cost structure as revenue grows.\nNote Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). These GAAP financial statements include certain charges the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operational performance.\nAs a result, the Company provides financial information in this MD&A that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides this supplemental non-GAAP financial information, which the Company\u2019s management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance, and which the Company believes provides greater transparency to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results.\nThe Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP net income as a result of the adjustment for items that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations. These items include charges associated with the Company\u2019s acquisitions, divestitures and the items described below in \u201cConsolidated Results.\u201d The Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance compared with prior and future periods can be enhanced by a presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items. The Company has incurred substantial expense and income associated with acquisitions and divestitures. While the Company cannot predict the exact timing or amounts of such charges, it does expect to treat these charges as special items in its future presentation of non-GAAP results.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nOur consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\nNon-GAAP Measures\nTo compare operating performance between the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company has adjusted GAAP operating income to exclude (1) amortization of intangible assets, earnout and retention expenses, (2) restructuring expenses primarily relating to severance, facility exits, and associated legal expenses, (3) acquisition and integration expenses, which include legal, accounting, and other expenses, (4) executive transition expenses, including severance for its former Chief Executive Officer, fees and expenses incurred in the search, for and hiring, of a new Chief Executive Officer, (5) loss on divestitures, net of selling costs necessary to complete the divestiture such as legal, accounting and compliance and (6) intangible asset impairment. See \u201cNote Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d above. The following tables present the reconciliation of GAAP operating income and GAAP operating margin to non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin, and GAAP net income (loss) to non-GAAP net income.\nIn June 2020 the Company acquired Environmental Integrated Solutions (\u201cEIS\u201d), EIS engineers products that clean air through a variety of technologies including volatile organic compounds (\u201cVOC\u201d) abatement, odor control, regenerative thermal oxidizers, and other air pollution control solutions, which complements our Industrial Solutions Segment businesses. In July 2020, the Company entered into joint venture agreement (the \u201cJV agreement\u201d) with Mader Holding L.P. (\u201cMader\u201d) in which CECO contributed the net assets of its Effox-Flextor damper business and Mader contributed the net assets of their damper business. During 2020, EIS and the joint venture accounted for $15.8 million in revenue. In 2018, we divested three non-core businesses; the Keystone Filter brand (\u201cKeystone\u201d) and Strobic Air Corporation (\u201cStrobic\u201d) in the first quarter and Zhongli in the fourth quarter (collectively, \u201cthe Divestitures\u201d). The exclusion of the operating results subsequent to their disposition impacts the comparability of our consolidated and segment operating results.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nConsolidated net sales in 2020 were $316.0 million compared with $341.9 million in 2019, a decrease of $25.9 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreases of $24.5 million in our Industrial Solutions air pollution control technologies, $18.2 million in custom-designed FCC cyclone systems serving the refinery markets, and $4.4 million in volume decreases in the Company\u2019s filtration and pump solutions sales. These decreases in net sales are offset by increases of $10.1 million in the Company\u2019s custom acoustical technologies that serve the natural gas power generation markets, $8.1 million in volatile organic compounds (\u201cVOC\u201d) abatement solutions from the EIS acquisition and $3.3 million in volume increases in our emissions management and water filtration solutions technologies.\nGross profit decreased by $9.0 million, or 7.9%, to $105.1 million in 2020 compared with $114.1 million in 2019. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to the decrease in sales as noted above, partially offset by favorable changes to product mix from previous period and cost reduction actions including employee furlough. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 33.3% and 33.4% in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOrders booked were $279.6 million in 2020 compared with $383.7 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in refinery, oil & gas, and pollution controls end markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacting our customers starting in March 2020.\nSelling and administrative expenses were $76.9 million in 2020 compared with $85.9 million in 2019. The decrease in administration expenses is primarily attributable to proactive cost reduction measures noted above taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including: headcount reductions, lower discretionary spend, the senior management team\u2019s temporary salary reduction, elimination of certain corporate-level costs, a 2-week furlough of United States-based employees, and travel restrictions across all segments. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 24.3% in 2020 compared with 25.1% in 2019. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to the items described above.\nAmortization and earnout expense was $8.8 million in 2020 and $8.5 million in 2019. The increase in expense is primarily attributable to $1.4 million in earnout expenses related to the EIS acquisition. The fair value adjustments to the earnout that were recorded in 2020 were the result of EIS performing above the acquisition operational expectations. The increase was partially offset by $1.1 million decrease in definite lived intangible asset amortization.\nAcquisitions and integration expenses related to the acquisition of EIS and the Mader joint venture were $1.4 million in 2020, which include legal, accounting and banking expenses, compared to $0.5 million in 2019 related to various merger and acquisition diligence activities.\nIn 2020, the Company incurred $1.5 million in executive transition expense related to severance for the Company\u2019s former Chief Executive Officer, as well as fees and expenses incurred in the search for, and hiring of, a new Chief Executive Officer.\nIn 2020, after conducting the annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.9 million. The charge of $0.9 million was recorded to impair the carrying value of a tradename intangible asset in the Company\u2019s Fluid Handling Solutions Segment. The impairment was recorded due to declining revenue related to the tradename exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating income for 2020 was $13.3 million, a decrease of $4.7 million from $18.0 million in 2019. Operating income as a percentage of sales for 2020 was 4.2% compared with 5.3% for 2019. The decrease in operating income is primarily attributable to $1.5 million in executive transition expenses which did not occur in 2019, $1.2 million increase in restructuring expenses, $0.9 million increase in acquisition and integration expenses in connection to the EIS acquisition and the Mader joint venture, intangible asset impairment of $0.9 million, $0.3 million increase in amortization and earnout expenses, and a decrease in net sales as noted above,\npartially offset by the decrease in selling and administration expenses due to the cost reduction measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNon-GAAP operating income was $28.2 million in 2020 and 2019. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of sales for 2020 was 8.9% compared with 8.2% for 2019. Non-GAAP operating income was equal year over year due to cost reductions described above offset by the decline in sales.\nOther income for 2020 was $2.0 million, an increase of $1.2 million from $0.8 million in 2019. The increase in other income was primarily attributable to a net periodic gain on pension assets of $0.3 million in 2020 compared to a net periodic expense of $0.3 million on pension assets in 2019 and $0.4 million increase year over year in foreign currency transaction gains.\nInterest expense decreased to $3.5 million in 2020 from $5.4 million in 2019. The decrease is due to lower interest rates and lower average debt balances in 2020 compared to 2019. During the year 2020, the Company had net borrowings of $9.5 million on its revolving credit facility, which consisted of $10.3 million used to fund the EIS acquisition on June 4, 2020 and $2.6 million used to pay term debt assumed in connection with the Mader joint venture, and $3.4 million in net repayments on the revolving credit facility.\nIncome tax expense (benefit) was $3.7 million and $(4.4) million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2020 was 30.1% compared with (32.7)% in 2019.\nIncome tax expense and the effective tax rate for 2020 were affected by certain permanent differences, including state income taxes, non-deductible incentive stock-based compensation, the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) inclusion and Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (\u201cFDII\u201d) deduction, tax credits, and differences in tax rates among the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nIncome tax benefit and the effective tax rate for 2019 were significantly impacted by a $4.4 million tax benefit on finalization of a tax position related to the 2018 divestiture of Zhongli. In addition, the Company recorded $3.5 million tax benefit related to U.S. and foreign tax incentives.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nSee the Management Discussion and Analysis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nBusiness Segments\nThe Company\u2019s operations in are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines or end markets that the segment serves and are presented in three reportable segments. The results of the segments are reviewed through the \u201cIncome from operations\u201d line on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The amounts presented in the Net Sales table below and in the following comments regarding our net sales at the reportable business segment level exclude both intra-segment and inter-segment net sales. The Income from Operations table and corresponding comments regarding operating income (loss) at the reportable segment level include both intra-segment and inter-segment operating income. The exclusion of the Divestitures\u2019 operating results subsequent to their disposition impacts the comparability of our segment operating results.\n(1)\nIncludes corporate compensation, professional services, information technology, other general and administrative corporate expenses and loss on divestitures, net of selling costs. This figure excludes earnout expenses / income, which are recorded in the segment in which the expense / income occurs.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nEnergy Solutions segment\nOur Energy Solutions segment net sales decreased $4.8 million to $205.5 million in 2020 compared with $210.3 million in 2019, a decrease of 2.3%. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreases of $18.2 million in custom-designed FCC cyclone systems serving the refinery markets offset by increases of $10.1 million in the Company\u2019s custom acoustical technologies that serve the natural gas power generation markets and $3.3 million in volume increases in our emissions management and water filtration solutions technologies.\nOperating income increased $0.3 million to $34.2 million for 2020 compared with $33.9 million in 2019, an increase of 0.8%. The increase in operating income in 2020 is primarily attributable to the decrease of $2.6 million in selling and administrative expenses related to the cost reductions as described above and the decrease in amortization expenses of $1.1 million partially offset by a decrease in gross profit of $3.1 million due to lower net sales and unfavorable product mix and an increase of $0.3 in restructuring expense.\nIndustrial Solutions segment\nOur Industrial Solutions segment net sales decreased $16.6 million to $74.7 million in 2020 compared with $91.3 million in 2019, a decrease of 18.2%. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreases of $24.5 million in our air pollution control technologies partially offset by $8.1 million increase in VOC abatement solutions from the EIS acquisition.\nOperating income decreased $3.5 million to $2.2 million for 2020 compared with $5.7 million in 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to a $4.6 million decrease in gross profit due to lower net sales, an increase of $0.5 million in restructuring expenses, and items related to the EIS acquisition including an increase of $1.4 million in earnout expense and $0.4 million in amortization expense. These decreases were partially offset by $3.2 million decrease in selling and administration related to cost reductions described above.\nFluid Handling Solutions segment\nOur Fluid Handling Solutions segment net sales decreased $4.4 million to $35.8 million in 2020 compared with $40.2 million in 2019, a decrease of 10.9%. The decrease is primarily attributable to volume decreases in the Company\u2019s filtration and pump solutions product line driven by lower demand from oil & gas and automotive end market customers.\nOperating income decreased $0.6 million to $5.0 million for 2020 compared with $5.6 million for 2019, a decrease of 10.7%. The decrease is primarily attributable to $1.6 million decrease in gross profit due to lower net sales and a $0.9 million intangible asset impairment expense partially offset by $1.8 million decrease in selling and administration related to cost reductions described above.\nCorporate and Other segment\nOperating expense for the Corporate and Other segment increased $0.9 million to $28.0 million for 2020 compared with $27.1 million for 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to a $1.5 million increase in executive transition expenses, $0.9 million increase in acquisition and integration expenses, partially offset by $1.5 million decrease in selling and administration expenses related to cost reductions described above.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nSee the Management Discussion and Analysis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a discussion of our results of operations for our business segments and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our Credit Facility (as defined below). Our principal uses of cash are operating costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding debt, working capital and other corporate requirements. Depending on market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, we may also repurchase some of our outstanding shares of common stock.\nWhen we undertake large jobs, our working capital objective is to make these projects self-funding. We work to achieve this by obtaining initial down payments, progress billing contracts, when possible, utilizing extended payment terms from material suppliers, and paying sub-contractors after payment from our customers, which is an industry practice. Our investment in net working capital is funded by cash flow from operations and by our revolving line of credit.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had working capital of $74.1 million, compared with $64.3 million at December 31, 2019. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.68 to 1.00 at December 31, 2020 as compared with a ratio of 1.56 to 1.00 at December 31, 2019.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, cash and cash equivalents totaled $36.0 million and $35.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $28.0 million and $27.4 million, respectively, of our cash and cash equivalents were held by non-U.S. subsidiaries, as well as being denominated in foreign currencies.\nDebt consisted of the following:\nIn 2020, the Company made repayments of $2.5 million on the term loan and net borrowings on the revolving credit lines of $9.5 million, consisting of $10.3 million used to fund the EIS acquisition on June 4, 2020 and $2.6 million used to pay term debt assumed in connection with the Mader joint venture, offset by $3.4 million in net repayments on the revolving credit facility.\nUnder the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility). Through September 30, 2021, the maximum Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is 3.50, after which time it will decrease to 3.25 until the end of the term of the Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company was in compliance with all related financial and other restrictive covenants under the Credit Facility.\nForeign Debt\nIn addition, the Company has a number of bank guarantee facilities and bilateral lines of credit in various foreign countries currently supported by cash, letters of credit or pledged assets and collateral under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility allows letters of credit and bank guarantee issuances of up to $50.0 million from the bilateral lines of credit secured by pledged assets and collateral under the Credit Facility.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company\u2019s foreign debt.\nTotal unused credit availability under our Credit Facility and other non-U.S. credit facilities and agreements, exclusive of any potential asset base limitations, is as follows:\nOverview of Cash Flows and Liquidity\nOperating Activities\nIn 2020, $4.4 million of cash was provided by operating activities compared with $10.2 million in 2019, a decrease of $5.8 million. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items decreased $5.7 million year-over-year. Additionally, working capital change year over year increased by $0.1 million which negatively affected cash flow from operations.\nIn 2019, $10.2 million of cash was provided by operating activities compared with $22.0 million provided in 2018, a decrease of $11.8 million. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items increased $16.0 million year-over-year. Working capital change year over year from operating activities in 2019 had a negative year-over-year net impact primarily from increases in accounts receivable and costs in excess of billings and decreases in other liabilities as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nInvesting Activities\nIn 2020, $9.2 million of cash was used in investing activities, which consisted of $5.9 million for acquisitions, $3.9 million of acquisition of property and equipment, offset by $0.6 million of proceeds from the disposal of assets held for sale.\nIn 2019, $5.1 million of cash was used in investing activities, which consisted of $5.7 million of acquisition of property and equipment offset by $0.5 million of proceeds from disposals of assets held for sale.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities in 2020 provided cash of $3.7 million, which consisted primarily of $9.2 million in net borrowings from our revolving credit lines of which $10.3 million was used to fund the EIS acquisition on June 4, 2020. This was offset by $2.5 million of payments on our term loan, $2.6 million used to pay term debt assumed in connection with the Mader joint venture on July 31, 2020, and $0.5 million in payments on capital leases.\nFinancing activities in 2019 used cash of $12.1 million, which consisted primarily of $3.0 million of payments on our term loan, $7.6 million net payments on our revolving credit lines, and $1.1 million payment of financing fees related to the refinancing of our Credit Facility.\nWe believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with our existing cash and borrowings available under our Credit Facility, will be sufficient for at least the next twelve months to fund our current anticipated uses of cash. After that, our ability to fund these expected uses of cash and to comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on the results of future operations, performance and cash flow. Our ability to fund these expected uses from the results of future operations will be subject to\nprevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, regulatory, legislative and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nEmployee Benefit Obligation\nBased on current assumptions, estimated contributions to our pension plan required in 2021 is zero. The amount and timing of required contributions to the pension trust depends on future investment performance of the pension funds and interest rate movements, among other things and, accordingly, we cannot reasonably estimate actual required payments. Currently, our pension plan is under-funded. As a result, absent major increases in long-term interest rates, above average returns on pension assets and/or changes in legislated funding requirements, we will be required to make contributions to our pension trust of varying amounts in future years.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:\n(1)\nPrimarily consists of purchase obligations for costs associated with uncompleted sales contracts.\n(2)\nFuture expected obligations under the Company\u2019s pension plan is included in the contractual cash obligations table above, up to, but not more than five years. The Company\u2019s pension plan policy allows it to fund an amount, which could be in excess of the pension cost expensed, subject to the limitations imposed by current tax regulations.\n(3)\nIncludes expected earnout liability and retention payment.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. We believe that, of our significant accounting policies, the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgments, estimates, and complexity.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenues, bad debts, warranties, share based compensation, income taxes, goodwill and intangible asset valuation, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from fixed-price contracts. We account for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. A significant amount of our revenue within the Energy Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments is recognized over a period of time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Progress is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation. For these contracts, the cost-to-cost measure best depicts the continuous transfer of goods or services to the customer.\nThe judgments and estimates involved include management\u2019s ability to accurately estimate the contracts\u2019 progress to completion at each financial reporting period. In addition, certain contracts are highly dependent on the work of contractors and other subcontractors participating in a project, over which we have no or limited control, and their performance on such project could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts. Delays resulting from these contractors and subcontractors, changes in the scope of the project, weather, and labor availability also can have an effect on a contract\u2019s profitability. Changes to job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability may result in revisions to contract revenue and costs and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are made.\nProvisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. No provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was needed at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nCredit and Collections\nThe Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for probable estimated losses resulting from either customer disputes or the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Company\u2019s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make the required payments, the Company may be required to record additional allowances or charges against income. The Company determines its allowance for doubtful accounts by considering all known collectability problems of customers\u2019 accounts and reviewing the aging of the outstanding receivables. The resulting allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is an estimate based upon the Company\u2019s knowledge of its business and customer base, and historical trends. The amount ultimately not collected may differ from the reserve established.\nInventories\nThe Company\u2019s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out inventory costing method. Inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on the Company\u2019s forecast of future demand and market conditions. Significant unanticipated changes to the Company\u2019s forecasts could require a change in the provision for excess or obsolete inventory.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives (buildings and improvements-generally five to 40 years; machinery and equipment-generally two to 15 years).\nIntangible assets\nIndefinite life intangible assets are comprised of tradenames, while finite life intangible assets are comprised of technology, customer lists, and tradenames. Finite life intangible assets are amortized on a straight line or accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives of seven to 10 years for technology, five to 20 years for customer lists, and 10 years for tradenames.\nLong-lived assets\nProperty, plant and equipment and finite life intangible assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment. If events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment, our impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of our assets and liabilities. This analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines, and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates. We conduct annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment, and review business plans for possible impairment. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be earned by the use of the asset or asset group. When impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value.\nAdditionally, we also evaluate the remaining useful life each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization. If the estimate of a long-lived asset\u2019s remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life.\nThe Company completes an annual (or more often if circumstances require) impairment assessment of its indefinite life intangible assets. As a part of its annual assessment, typically, the Company first qualitatively assesses whether current events or changes in circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying amount. If there is a qualitative determination that the fair value of a particular asset is more likely than not greater than its carrying value, we do not need to proceed to the quantitative estimated fair value test for that asset. If this qualitative assessment indicates a more likely than not potential that the asset may be impaired, the estimated fair value is determined by the relief from royalty method. If the estimated fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value.\nDuring 2020 and 2019, our annual impairment test indicated that one and zero, respectively, of our indefinite-lived tradenames was impaired. Accordingly, we recognized impairment charges in our financial results of $0.9 million and zero for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For additional information on impairment testing results, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill\nThe Company completes an annual (or more often if circumstances require) goodwill impairment assessment on October 1 on a reporting unit level, at or below the operating segment level. As a part of its annual assessment, the Company first qualitatively assesses whether current events or changes in circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If there is a qualitative determination that the fair value of a particular reporting unit is more likely than not greater than its carrying value, the Company does not need to quantitatively test for goodwill impairment for that reporting unit. If this qualitative assessment indicates a more likely than not potential that the asset may be impaired, the estimated fair value is calculated using a weighting of the income method and the market method. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded.\nThe Company bases its measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit using a 50/50 weighting of the income method and the market method. The income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the significant assumptions of projected revenue, projected operational profit, terminal growth rates, and the cost of capital. Projected revenue, projected operational profit and terminal growth rates are significant assumptions because they are three primary drivers of the projected cash flows in the discounted future cash flow approach. Cost of capital is a significant assumption as it is the discount rate used to calculate the current fair value of those projected cash flows. The market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. Significant estimates in the market approach include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit. Based on the analysis, the resultant estimated fair value of all of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value as of December 31, 2020. For additional information on goodwill impairment testing results, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are determined using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 740, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d. Income tax expense includes federal, state and foreign income taxes.\nDeferred income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Tax credits and other incentives reduce income tax expense in the year the credits are claimed.\nManagement must assess the need to accrue or disclose uncertain tax positions for proposed potential adjustments from various federal, state and foreign tax authorities who regularly audit the Company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments, management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions, including many foreign jurisdictions. The accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records the related interest expense and penalties, if any, as tax expense in the tax provision.\nManagement must assess the realizability of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carry forward periods), projected future taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.\nThe company has made an accounting policy election to record the U.S. income tax effect of future global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) inclusions in the period in which they arise, rather than establishing deferred taxes with respect to the expected future tax liabilities associated with future GILTI inclusion.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries are not permanently reinvested. A liability has been recorded for the deferred taxes on such undistributed foreign earnings. The amount is attributable primarily to the foreign withholding taxes that would become payable should the Company repatriate cash held in its foreign operations.\nPension Benefit Plan Assumptions\nWe sponsor a pension plan for certain employees. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plan. These factors include key assumptions, such as a discount rate and expected return on plan assets. In addition, our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the liability. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense we have recorded or may record in the future. An analysis for the expense associated with our pension plan is difficult due to the variety of assumptions utilized. For example, one of the significant assumptions used to determine projected benefit obligation is the discount rate. At December 31, 2020, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would change the projected benefit obligation by approximately $1.1 million and the annual pension expense by approximately $16,000. Additionally, a 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would change the pension expense by approximately $69,000.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments and recognize this cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide the services, based on the fair value of the award at the date of the grant as determined by the Black-Scholes valuation method for stock options, or current publicly traded market price on the grant date for restricted stock units.\nCertain of our awards of restricted share units include performance conditions for achieving designated levels of operating performance. We must estimate the probability of achieving the performance condition at each reporting period.\nProduct Warranties\nThe Company\u2019s warranty reserve is to cover the products sold. The warranty accrual is based on historical claims information. The warranty reserve is reviewed and adjusted as necessary at each reporting period.\nOther significant accounting policies\nOther significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of our financial statements. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which discusses accounting policies that must be selected by us when there are acceptable alternatives.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to certain market risks, primarily changes in interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates. For the Company, these exposures are primarily related to changes in interest rates. We do not currently hold any derivatives or other financial instruments purely for trading or speculative purposes.\nThe carrying value of the Company\u2019s total long-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2020 was $74.0 million. Market risk was estimated as the potential decrease (increase) in future earnings and cash flows resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase (decrease) in the Company\u2019s estimated weighted average borrowing rate at December 31, 2020. Most of the interest on the Company\u2019s debt is indexed to either the LIBOR or EURIBOR market rates. The estimated annual impact of a hypothetical 10% change in the estimated weighted average borrowing rate at December 31, 2020 is $0.2 million.\nThe Company has wholly-owned subsidiaries in several countries, including in the Netherlands, Canada, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Mexico, United Kingdom, Singapore, Shanghai, Pune India, Dubai and Chile. In the past, we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure, and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results. Future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues, operating expenses and earnings.

Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020.\nThe management of the Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur due to simple errors or mistakes. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions regarding the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and accuracy of the financial statements and other information included in this report. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) (the \u201cFramework\u201d) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, its internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the Framework.\nThere are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any system of internal controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective internal controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\nItem 9A includes the audit report of BDO USA, LLP on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nCECO Environmental Corp. and Subsidiaries\nCincinnati, Ohio\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited CECO Environmental Corp. and Subsidiaries\u2019 (the \u201cCompany\u2019s\u201d) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the \u201cCOSO criteria\u201d). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), shareholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated March 3, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nCincinnati, Ohio\nMarch 3, 2021",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nCECO Environmental Corp. and Subsidiaries\nCincinnati, Ohio\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CECO Environmental Corp. and Subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), shareholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d) and our report dated March 3, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nOver Time Revenue Recognition Using the Cost-to-Cost Input Approach\nAs described in Note 1 to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, the Company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from fixed-price contracts within the Energy Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments. The revenue for such contracts is recognized over a period of time based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs. Under this method, the Company must continually assess the total estimated costs and progress toward completion for each contract. Changes in these estimates can have a material impact on the amount of revenue and gross profit recognized each period.\nWe identified over time revenue recognition as a critical audit matter. The determination of estimated cost and progress to completion requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, which includes an analysis of total estimated labor, material and subcontract costs, historical experience, current performance to date and the conditions to complete each contract. This analysis requires significant management judgment, which affects the amount of revenue recognized by the Company. Auditing these complex judgments and assumptions involves especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence available and effort required to address these matters.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n\u2022\nTesting the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls relating to the determination of estimated costs to complete a project including the monthly review of open over time projects and review of estimated cost calculations to complete open projects. These controls include the review of the reasonableness of the assumptions used and the appropriateness of methodologies used to determine costs to complete.\n\u2022\nTesting the completeness, existence, and accuracy of estimated project cost calculations for a sample of contracts by validating the underlying project data and assumptions used as inputs through the inspection of relevant source documents including project plans or budgets and activity reports, invoices of costs incurred to date, results of recent similar historical projects, other third-party subcontractor support, inquiry of project managers, and confirmations of estimates to complete with customers.\n\u2022\nPerforming a retrospective review on a sample basis of project costs on a project by project basis and investigating variances outside of predetermined thresholds through the inspection of relevant source documents.\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.\nCincinnati, Ohio\nMarch 3, 2021\nCECO ENVIRONMENTAL CORP.

CECO provides innovative technology and application expertise that helps companies grow their businesses with safe, clean, and more efficient solutions to help protect our shared environment. CECO serves both established and emerging industries in regions around the world working to improve air quality, optimize the energy value chain, and provide customized engineered solutions in multiple applications that include power generation, petrochemical processing, general industrial, refining, oil & gas, electric vehicle production, poly silicon fabrication, battery recycling, and wastewater treatment, along with a wide range of other industries.\nCOVID-19\nOn January 30, 2020, the WHO announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) originating in Wuhan, China and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally beyond its point of origin. On March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. As of March 3, 2021, the virus continues to spread and has had a significant impact on worldwide economic activity and on macroeconomic conditions and the end markets of our business. Vaccine administration is underway, however new variants of COVID-19 continue to emerge. There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of vaccines and current tests and treatments with regard to the new variants. The Company has instituted some and may take additional temporary precautionary measures to comply with government directives and guidelines and minimize business disruption.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) was signed into law. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The CARES act did not have a material impact on the Company.\nThe outbreak and a continued spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a substantial curtailment of business activities worldwide and has caused weakened economic conditions, both in the United States and abroad. COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on the Company's ongoing operations and the end markets in which it serves. However, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve as of the date of this filing, and as such, it is uncertain as to the full magnitude that the pandemic will have on the Company\u2019s financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations. Management is actively monitoring the impact of the pandemic on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce.\nPrinciples of consolidation-Our consolidated financial statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nIn 2020, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement (the \u201cJV agreement\u201d) with Mader Holding L.P. (\u201cMader\u201d). Under the terms of the JV agreement, CECO holds 70% of the equity in the joint venture. The noncontrolling interest in Mader is reported as a separate component on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the joint venture.\nUnless indicated, all balances within tables are in thousands except per share amounts.\nUse of estimates-The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash equivalents-We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Restricted Cash is cash in support of letters of credit issued by various foreign subsidiaries of the Company. The Company occasionally enters into letters of credit with durations in excess of one year.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nAccounts Receivable-Receivables are generally uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal terms requiring payment generally within 30 days from the invoice date unless otherwise determined by specific contract terms, generally due to retainage provisions. The Company\u2019s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts for trade receivables is primarily determined based upon the length of time that the receivables are past due. In addition, management estimates are used to determine probable losses based upon an analysis of prior collection experience, specific account risks and economic conditions. Accounts are deemed uncollectible based on past account experience and the current financial condition of the account.\nInventories-The Company\u2019s inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out inventory costing method. Inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded based on the Company\u2019s forecast of future demand and market conditions. Significant unanticipated changes to the Company\u2019s forecasts could require a change in the provision for excess or obsolete inventory.\nAssets Held for Sale-The Company classifies properties as held for sale when certain criteria are met. At such time, the properties, including significant assets that are expected to be transferred as part of a sale transaction, are presented separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less costs to sell and depreciation is no longer recognized. Assets classified as held for sale at December 31, 2020 include one building.\nProperty, plant and equipment-Property, plant and equipment are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method in amounts sufficient to amortize the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives (buildings and improvements-generally five to 40 years; machinery and equipment-generally two to 15 years). Upon sale or disposal of property, plant and equipment, the applicable amounts of asset cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the net amount, less any proceeds from sale, is recorded in income.\nIntangible assets- Indefinite life intangible assets are comprised of tradenames, while finite life intangible assets are comprised of technology, customer lists, and tradenames. Finite life intangible assets are amortized on a straight line or accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives of seven to 10 years for technology, five to 20 years for customer lists, and 10 years for tradenames.\nLong-lived assets-Property, plant and equipment and finite life intangible assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment. If events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment, our impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of our assets and liabilities. This analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines, and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates. We conduct annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment, and review business plans for possible impairment. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be earned by the use of the asset or asset group. When impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value.\nAdditionally, the Company evaluates the remaining useful life each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization. If the estimate of a long-lived asset\u2019s remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life.\nThe Company completes an annual (or more often if circumstances require) impairment assessment on October 1 of its indefinite life intangible assets. As a part of its annual assessment, typically, the Company first qualitatively assesses whether current events or changes in circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying amount. If there is a qualitative determination that the fair value of a particular asset is more likely than not greater than its carrying value, we do not need to proceed to the quantitative estimated fair value test for that asset. If this qualitative assessment indicates a more likely than not potential that the asset may be impaired, the estimated fair value is\ndetermined by the relief from royalty method. If the estimated fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value.\nDuring 2020, our annual impairment test indicated that one of our indefinite-lived tradenames was impaired. Accordingly, we recognized impairment charges in our financial results of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. There was no impairment recorded during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. For additional information on impairment testing results, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill-The Company completes an annual (or more often if circumstances require) impairment assessment on October 1 of its goodwill on a reporting unit level, at or below the operating segment level. As a part of its annual assessment, the Company first qualitatively assesses whether current events or changes in circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If there is a qualitative determination that the fair value of a particular reporting unit is more likely than not greater than its carrying value, the Company does not need to quantitatively test for goodwill impairment for that reporting unit. If this qualitative assessment indicates a more likely than not potential that the asset may be impaired, the estimated fair value is determined using a weighting of the income method and the market method. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded.\nDeferred charges-Deferred charges include deferred financing costs, which are amortized to interest expense over the life of the related loan. In fiscal 2019, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility amended the Company\u2019s existing amended and restated agreement. In connection with the Credit Facility, the Company incurred $1.1 million in customary closing fees in 2019 that were capitalized and classified as a debt discount. Additionally, in fiscal 2019, $0.4 million of existing debt discount related to the 2017 long-term debt modification was expensed, and classified as interest expense, as a result of the Credit Facility (see Note 8 for further details on the Credit Facility). Amortization expense was $0.4 million, $1.1 million and $1.1 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, remaining capitalized deferred financing costs of $1.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively, are included as a discount to debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRevenue recognition\nEnergy Solutions and Industrial Solutions Segments-Within the Energy Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from fixed-price contracts. We account for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.\nFor each contract, we assess the goods and services promised to a customer and identify a performance obligation for each distinct promised good or service. The typical life of our contracts is generally less than 12 months and each contract generally contains only one performance obligation, to provide goods or services to the customer. We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract.\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. A significant amount of our revenue within the Energy Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments is recognized over a period of time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Progress is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation. For these contracts, the cost-to-cost measure best depicts the continuous transfer of goods or services to the customer.\nFor contracts where the duration is short, total contract revenue is insignificant, or control does not continuously transfer to the customer, revenues are recognized at the point in time control passes to the customer, which occurs generally upon shipment of product.\nProgress payments are generally made over the duration of the contract. Shipping and handling activities after control of the products has transferred to the customer are considered fulfillment activities. Sales taxes are recorded on a net basis.\nFluid Handling Solutions Segments-Within the Fluid Handling Solutions segment, a significant portion of our revenue is primarily derived from sales of inventory product and is recognized at the point in time control passes to the customer, which occurs generally upon shipment of the product.\nPayments vary by customer but are typically due within 30 days. Shipping and handling activities after control of the products has transferred to the customer are considered fulfillment activities. Sales taxes are recorded on a net basis.\nContract Assets and Contract Liabilities - Contract assets consist of costs and earnings in excess of billings, costs incurred for contracts recognized at a point in time, and retainage. Costs and earnings in excess of billings represent the estimated value of unbilled work for contracts with performance obligations recognized over time and are separately classified as current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Costs incurred for contracts recognized at a point in time are classified within inventories as work-in-process. Retainage represents a portion of the contract billings that have been billed, but for which the contract allows the customer to retain a portion of the billed amount until final settlement. Retainage is not considered to be a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer. Retainage is classified within accounts receivable and deferred charges and other assets depending on when it is due. Almost all of the Company\u2019s contract assets are classified as current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nBillings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are current liabilities, which relate to fixed-price contracts recognized over time, and represents payments in advance of performing the related contract work. Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts is not considered to be a significant financing component because it is generally used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract. Contract liabilities, classified in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, include advance payments received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized for contracts where revenue is recognized at a point in time. Contract liabilities are reduced when the associated revenue from the contract is recognized, which is generally within one year.\nThe revenue streams within the Company are consistent with those disclosed for our reportable segments. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on product offerings and segments.\nProvisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes to job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability may result in revisions to contract revenue and costs and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are made. There was no provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nCost of sales-Cost of sales amounts include materials, subcontract costs, direct labor and associated benefits, inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving, inspection, warehousing, and depreciation.\nClaims-Change orders arise when the scope of the original project is modified for any of a variety of reasons. The Company will negotiate the extent of the modifications, its expected costs and recovery with the customer. Costs related to change orders are added to the expected total cost of the project. In cases where contract revenues are assured beyond a reasonable doubt to be increased in excess of the expected costs of the change order, incremental profit also is recognized on the contract. Such assurance is generally only achieved when the customer approves in writing the scope and pricing of the change order. Change orders that are in dispute are effectively handled as claims.\nClaims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price that the Company seeks to collect from customers or others for customer-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price. Costs attributable to claims are treated as contract costs as incurred.\nThe Company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred costs when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated. When the customer or other parties agree in writing to the amount of the claim to be recovered by the Company, the amount of the claim becomes contractual and is accounted for as an increase in the contract\u2019s total estimated revenue and estimated cost. As actual costs are incurred and revenues are recognized over time, a corresponding percentage of the revised total estimated profit will therefore be recognized.\nShould it become probable that the claim will not result in additional contract revenue, the Company removes the related contract revenues from its previous estimate of total revenues, which effectively reduces the estimated profit margin on the job and negatively impacts profit for the period.\nPre-contract costs-Pre-contract costs are not significant and are primarily internal costs. As most of the Company\u2019s contracts are one year or less, the Company expenses all pre-contract costs as incurred regardless of whether or not the bids are successful. A majority of our business is obtained through a bidding process and this activity is on-going with multiple bids in process at any one time. These costs consist primarily of engineering, sales and project manager wages, fringes and general corporate overhead and it is deemed impractical to track activities related to any one specific contract.\nSelling and administrative expenses-Selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations include sales and administrative wages and associated benefits, selling and office expenses, professional fees, bad debt expense and depreciation. Selling and administrative expenses are charged to expense as incurred.\nAcquisition and integration expenses-Acquisition and integration expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations are related to acquisition activities, which include, legal, accounting, and other expenses.\nAmortization and earnout expenses-Amortization and earnout expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations include amortization of intangible assets, and changes to earnout and contingent compensation amounts related to acquisitions.\nRestructuring expenses-Restructuring expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations include expenses related to an ongoing restructuring program to reduce operating costs in the future. Within restructuring expenses are charges related to severance, facility exit, legal and property, plant and equipment impairment. The Company\u2019s policy is to recognize restructuring expenses in accordance with the accounting rules related to exit or disposal activities.\nExecutive transition expenses-Executive transition expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations include expenses related to the severance for the Company\u2019s former Chief Executive Officer, as well as fees and expenses incurred in the search for, and hiring of, a new Chief Executive Officer.\nProduct Warranties-The Company\u2019s warranty reserve is to cover the products sold. The warranty accrual is based on historical claims information. The warranty reserve is reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a quarterly basis and is presented within Note 7.\nResearch and Development-Although not technically defined as research and development, a significant amount of time, effort and expense is devoted to (a) custom engineering which qualifies products for specific customer applications, (b) developing proprietary process technology and (c) partnering with customers to develop new products.\nIncome taxes - Income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 740, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d. Income tax expense includes federal, state and foreign income taxes.\nDeferred income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Tax credits and other incentives reduce income tax expense in the year the credits are claimed.\nManagement must assess the need to accrue or disclose uncertain tax positions for proposed potential adjustments from various federal, state and foreign tax authorities who regularly audit the Company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments, management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions, including many foreign jurisdictions. The accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records the related interest expense and penalties, if any, as tax expense in the tax provision.\nManagement must assess the realizability of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carry forward periods), projected future taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.\nThe company has made an accounting policy election to record the U.S. income tax effect of future global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) inclusions in the period in which they arise, rather than establishing deferred taxes with respect to the expected future tax liabilities associated with future GILTI inclusion.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries are not permanently reinvested. A liability has been recorded for the deferred taxes on such undistributed foreign earnings. The amount is attributable primarily to the foreign withholding taxes that would become payable should the Company repatriate cash held in its foreign operations.\nEarnings per share-The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nOptions and unvested restricted stock units are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share using the treasury stock method. For 2020, 2019 and 2018, outstanding options and unvested restricted stock units of 1.0 million, 0.4 million and 0.8 million, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their having an anti-dilutive effect.\nOnce a restricted stock award vests, it is included in the computation of weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of basic and diluted earnings per share.\nForeign Currency Translation-The functional currencies of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries are their local currencies and their books and records are maintained in the local currency. The assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into United States Dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d) based on the end-of period exchange rates and the resultant translation adjustments are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss in Shareholders\u2019 equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIncome and expenses are translated into USD at average exchange rates in effect during the period.\nTransactions denominated in other than the local currency are remeasured into the local currency and the resulting exchange gains or losses are included in \u201cOther income (expense), net\u201d line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Transaction gains were $1.3 million, $0.9 million and $0.7 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nReclassifications -Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified in order to conform to the current year presentation.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, \u201cCompensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans,\u201d that makes minor changes to the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefit plans. The new guidance eliminates requirements for certain disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial and requires new ones that the FASB considers pertinent. ASU 2018-14 is effective for us December 15, 2020. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our statement of operations or liquidity. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the Company\u2019s pension plans.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\" (\"ASU 2019-12\"), which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. ASU 2019-12 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2021. We do not expect ASU 2019-12 to have a material impact on our financial statements.\n2.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and certain other assets, foreign debt, and accounts payable, which approximate fair value at December 31, 2020 and 2019, due to their short-term nature or variable, market-driven interest rates.\nThe fair value of the debt issued under our Credit Agreement was $74.0 million and $67.3 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fair value was determined considering market conditions, our credit worthiness and the current terms of our debt, which is considered Level 2 on the fair value hierarchy.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $36.0 million and $35.6 million, respectively, of which $28.0 million and $27.4 million, respectively, was held outside of the United States, principally in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, China, and Canada.\nConcentrations of credit risk:\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, and accounts receivable. We maintain cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions. We perform periodic evaluations of the financial institutions in which our cash is invested. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade and contract receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and various geographic areas. Additionally, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers\u2019 financial condition.\n3.Accounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable consisted of the following:\nBalances billed, but not paid by customers under retainage provisions in contracts that are recorded in deferred charges and other assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, amounted to approximately $1.5 million and $0.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Retainage receivables on contracts in progress are generally collected within a year or two subsequent to contract completion.\nProvision for doubtful accounts was $0.9 million, $0.3 million and $1.4 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, while accounts charged to the allowance were $0.4 million, $0.6 million and $0.8 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n4.Inventories\nInventories consisted of the following:\nAmounts credited to the allowance for obsolete inventory and charged to cost of sales amounted to $0.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.5 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Items charged to the allowance for inventory write-offs were $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.3 million, during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n5.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation expense was $2.5 million, $2.1 million and $3.5 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n6.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has an aggregate amount of goodwill acquired of $222.5 million and $212.8 million, respectively, and an aggregate amount of impairment losses of $60.7 million which was recognized in 2017.\nThe Company\u2019s indefinite lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following:\nDuring 2020 and 2019, the Company reassessed the useful lives of certain tradenames and determined that $0.7 million and $3.9 million, respectively, of tradenames would have useful lives of 10 years versus indefinite.\nThe Company completes an annual (or more often if circumstances require) impairment assessment of its goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets on October 1 at the reporting unit level.\nThe Company bases its measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit using a 50/50 weighting of the income method and the market method. The income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the significant assumptions of projected revenue, projected operational profit, terminal growth rates, and the cost of capital. Projected revenue and operational profit, and terminal growth rates were determined to be significant assumptions because they are three primary drivers of the projected cash flows in the discounted future cash flow approach. Cost of capital was also determined to be a significant assumption as it is the discount rate used to calculate the current fair value of those projected cash flows. The market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. Significant estimates in the market approach include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit. Based on this analysis, the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value as of October 1, 2020. There was no goodwill impairment in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nIn the 2020 impairment analysis for the Fluid Handling Solutions reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of $31.6 million at the analysis date, the fair value only exceeded the carrying value by 7%. Management\u2019s projections used to estimate the undiscounted cash flows included modest increase to sales volumes and operational improvements designed to reduce costs. Changes in any of the significant assumptions used, including if the Company does not successfully achieve its 2021 operating plan, can materially affect the expected cash flows, and such impacts can result in a potentially material non-cash impairment charge. Therefore, the key assumptions most susceptible to change are projected revenue and projected operational profit. We determined that with other assumptions held constant under our weighted income and market method for measuring fair value, a decrease in the projected average revenue growth rates of approximately 90 basis points or a decrease in the projected average EBITDA rates of approximately 105 basis points would result in fair value of the reporting unit being equal to its carrying value.\nThe Company also performed an impairment analysis for all indefinite life intangible assets, which consists of tradenames, as of October 1, 2020. The Company based its measurement of the fair value of the indefinite life intangible assets utilizing the relief from royalty method. The significant assumptions used under the relief from royalty method are projected revenue, royalty rates, terminal growth rates, and the cost of capital. Projected revenue, royalty rates and terminal growth rates were determined to be significant assumptions because they are three primary drivers of the projected royalty cash flows in the relief from royalty method. Cost of capital was also determined to be a significant assumption as it is the discount rate used to calculate the current fair value of those projected royalty cash flows. Changes in any of the significant assumptions used can materially affect the expected cash flows, and such impacts can result in material non-cash impairment charges. Under this approach, the estimated fair value of the indefinite life intangible assets exceeded their carrying value for all but one tradename within our Fluid Handling Solutions segment as of the testing date. Accordingly, we recognized impairment charges in our financial results of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. There was no impairment charge in 2019 and 2018.\nAs described above, the fair value measurement methods used in the Company\u2019s goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets impairment analyses utilizes a number of significant unobservable inputs or Level 3 assumptions. These assumptions include, among others, projections of our future operating results, the implied fair value of these assets using an income approach by preparing a discounted cash flow analysis and other subjective assumptions.\nThe Company\u2019s finite lived intangible assets consisted of the following:\nAmortization expense of finite life intangible assets was $7.4 million, $8.5 million and $9.6 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization over the next five years for finite life intangibles is $6.4 million in 2021, $5.5 million in 2022, $4.6 million in 2023, $3.9 million in 2024, and $2.9 million in 2025.\n7.\nAccounts Payable and Accrued Expenses\nAccounts payable and accrued expense consisted of the following:\nThe activity in the Company\u2019s current portion of earnout liability which is recorded in Accounts payable and accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, consisted of the following:\n8.\nSenior debt\nDebt consisted of the following:\nIn 2020, the Company made repayments of $2.5 million on the term loan and had net borrowings on the revolving credit lines of $9.2 million. Scheduled principal payments under our Credit Facility are $3.1 million in 2021, $3.7 million in 2022, $4.4 million in 2023, and $62.8 million in 2024.\nCredit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $7.6 million and $11.0 million of letters of credit were outstanding, respectively. Total unused credit availability under the Company\u2019s senior secured term loan and senior secured revolver loan with sub-facilities for letters of credit, swing-line loans and senior secured multi-currency loans was $60.8 million and $82.3 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until June 11, 2024, at which time all outstanding balances of the Credit Facility must be repaid.\nAt the Company\u2019s option, revolving loans and the term loans accrue interest at a per annum rate based on either the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, (b) the Agent\u2019s prime lending rate, (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus a margin ranging from 1.0% to 2.0% depending on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Leverage Ratio (\u201cBase Rate\u201d), or (d) a Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 1.0% to 2.0% depending on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Interest on swing line loans is the Base Rate.\nInterest on Base Rate loans is payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter and at maturity. Interest on Eurocurrency Rate loans is payable on the last date of each applicable Interest Period (as defined in the agreement), but in no event less than once every three months and at maturity. The weighted average stated interest rate on outstanding borrowings was 2.25% and 3.80% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nUnder the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of a Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility). Through September 30, 2021, the maximum Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is 3.50, after which time it will decrease to 3.25 until the end of the term of the Credit Facility.\nThe Company has granted a security interest in substantially all of its assets to secure its obligations pursuant to the Credit Facility. The Company\u2019s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company\u2019s U.S. subsidiaries and such guaranty obligations are secured by a security interest on substantially all the assets of such subsidiaries, including certain real property. The\nCompany\u2019s obligations under the Credit Agreement may also be guaranteed by the Company\u2019s material foreign subsidiaries to the extent no adverse tax consequences would result to the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company was in compliance with all related financial and other restrictive covenants under the Credit Facility.\nForeign Debt\nThe Company has a number of bank guarantee facilities and bilateral lines of credit in various foreign countries currently supported by cash, letters of credit or pledged assets and collateral under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility allows letters of credit and bank guarantee issuances of up to $50.0 million from the bilateral lines of credit secured by pledged assets and collateral under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, $17.2 million in bank guarantees were outstanding. In addition, a subsidiary of the Company located in the Netherlands has a Euro-denominated bank guarantee agreement secured by local assets under which $3.4 million in bank guarantees were outstanding as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the borrowers of these facilities and agreements were in compliance with all related financial and other restrictive covenants.\n9.\nShareholders\u2019 Equity\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company\u2019s 2017 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the \u201c2017 Plan\u201d) was approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders on May 16, 2017 which replaced the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2007 Plan\u201d). No further grants will be made under the 2007 Plan, but outstanding awards under the 2007 Plan will continue to be unaffected in accordance with their terms. The 2017 Plan permits the granting of stock options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock at the date of the grant, and other stock-based awards, including appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and dividend equivalents. A total of 1.9 million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance. As of December 31, 2020, 1.1 million shares remain available for future issuance. Stock options granted to employees generally vest equally over a period of four years from the date of the grant. Stock awards granted to employees generally vest over a period of three to four years from the date of the grant.\nOn July 6, 2020, in connection with the appointment of our Chief Executive Officer, the Company granted our Chief Executive Officer approximately 94,000 restricted stock units with a fair value of $0.6 million, which are being expensed over the vesting period of four years. The Company also granted our Chief Executive Officer approximately 1.2 million stock options with a fair value of $2.4 million that are being expensed over the vesting period of four years. These grants of restricted stock units and stock options (\u201c2020 Inducement Awards\u201d) were approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and are not included in 2017 Plan.\nShare-based compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock awards under these plans was $1.8 million, $2.7 million and $3.1 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The tax benefit related to share based compensation expense was $0.3 million, $0.4 million and $0.5 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d) was approved by shareholders on June 11, 2020. The ESPP is administered by the Compensation Committee. The ESPP allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a 15% discount from market price and pay for the shares through payroll deductions. Eligible employees can enter the plan at specific \u201coffering dates\u201d that occur in six-month intervals.\nThe aggregate maximum number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock that may be granted under the ESPP is 1.3 million shares over the ten-year term of the ESPP, subject to adjustment in the event there is a reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock split-up, or similar transaction with respect to the common stock. As of December 31, 2020, 1.3 million shares remain available for future issuance.\nThe Company recognized employee stock purchase plan expense of $20,000, $60,000 and $90,000 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nStock Options\nThe estimated weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during 2020, was $1.98 per option, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following assumptions:\nExpected Volatility: The Company utilizes a volatility factor based on the Company\u2019s historical stock prices for a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock option utilizing weekly price observations. For 2020, the Company utilized weighted-average volatility factors of 52.5%.\nExpected Term: Due to limited historical exercise data, the Company utilizes the simplified method of determining the expected term based on the vesting schedules and terms of the stock options. For 2020, the Company utilized weighted-average expected term factors of 5.0 years.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate: The risk-free interest rate factor utilized is based upon the implied yields currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues over the expected term of the stock options. For 2020, the Company utilized a weighted-average risk-free interest rate factor of 0.3%.\nThe fair value of stock options is recorded as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods of the options and we account for forfeitures when they occur.\nInformation related to all stock options under the 2017 Plan, 2007 Plan, and the 2020 Inducement Awards for 2020, 2019 and 2018 is shown in the tables below:\nRestricted Stock Awards\nInformation related to restricted stock awards under the 2017 Plan, 2007 Plan, and the 2020 Inducement Awards for 2020, 2019 and 2018 is shown in the table below. The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the price of the stock in the open market on the date of the grant. The fair value of the restricted stock awards is recorded as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods of the awards and we account for forfeitures when they occur.\nThe Company received zero, $7,000 and $0.1 million of cash from employees exercising options in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The intrinsic value of options exercised during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was zero, $0.3 million and $24,000, respectively.\nUnrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested shares of stock options, restricted stock and performance units was $6.0 million at December 31, 2020 and will be recognized over a weighted average vesting period of 2.7 years.\nDividends\nOur dividend policy and the payment of cash dividends under that policy are subject to the Board of Director\u2019s continuing determination that the dividend policy and the declaration of dividends are in the best interest of the Company\u2019s stockholders. Future dividends and the dividend policy may be changed at the Company\u2019s discretion at any time. Payment of dividends is also subject to the continuing compliance with our financial covenants under our Credit Facility. On November 6, 2017, the Board of Directors reviewed the Company\u2019s dividend policy and determined that it would be in the best interest of the stockholders to suspend dividend payments.\n10.\nPension and Employee Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for certain union employees. The accrual of future benefits for all participants who are non-union employees was frozen effective December 31, 2008. The plan is funded in accordance with the funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\nThe following tables set forth the plan changes in benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status on the measurement dates:\nThe funded status as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, was $9.7 million, $8.8 million and $8.8 million, respectively and is recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets within other long-term liabilities.\nThe details of net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations are as follows:\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income:\nThe $3.3 million net loss arising in the year were primarily due to decreases in the discount rate, partially offset by higher actual returns on plan assets.\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs\nThe basis of the long-term rate of return assumption reflects the current asset mix for the pension plan of approximately 30% to 40% debt securities and 60% to 70% equity securities with assumed average annual returns of approximately 4% to 6% for debt securities and 8% to 12% for equity securities. The investment portfolio for the pension plan will be adjusted periodically to maintain the current ratios of debt securities and equity securities. Additional consideration is given to the historical returns for the pension plan as well as\nfuture long range projections of investment returns for each asset category. The long-term rate of return also considers administrative expenses of the plan.\nBenefits under the plan is not based on wages and, therefore, future wage adjustments have no effect on the projected benefit obligation.\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company updated the mortality tables (RP-2019 Total Mortality Table, RP-2018 Total Mortality Table, and RP-2017 Total Mortality Table for each respective year) in the underlying assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation.\nPension plan assets are invested in trusts comprised primarily of investments in various debt and equity funds. A fiduciary committee establishes the target asset mix and monitors asset performance. The expected rate of return on assets includes the determination of a real rate of return for equity and fixed income investment applied to the portfolio based on their relative weighting, increased by an underlying inflation rate.\nOur defined benefit pension plan asset allocation by asset category is as follows:\nEstimated pension plan cash obligations are $2.2 million, $2.2 million, $2.2 million, $2.2 million, and $2.2 million for 2021 through 2025, respectively, and a total of $10.3 million for the years 2026 through 2030.\nFair Value Measurements of Pension Plan Assets\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for pension assets measured at fair value:\n\u2022\nCash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit in money market funds. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.\n\u2022\nEquity securities: Equity securities consist of various managed funds that invest primarily in common stocks. These securities are valued at the net asset value of shares held by the plan at year end. The net asset value is calculated based on the underlying shares and investments held by the funds.\n\u2022\nDebt securities: Debt securities consist of U.S. government and agency securities, corporate bonds and notes, and managed funds that invest in fixed income securities. U.S governmental and agency securities are valued at closing prices reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds and notes are valued using market inputs including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research publications. Inputs may be prioritized differently at certain times based on market conditions. Managed funds are valued at the net asset value of shares held by the plan at year end. The net asset value is calculated based on the underlying investments held by the fund.\nThe preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nThe Company\u2019s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.\nThe levels assigned to the defined benefit plan assets as of December 31, 2020, are summarized in the tables below:\nThe levels assigned to the defined benefit plan assets as of December 31, 2019, are summarized in the tables below:\nThe Company contributes to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover its union-represented employees. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:\n\u2022\nAssets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.\n\u2022\nIf a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.\n\u2022\nIf the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, CECO may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.\nThe Company\u2019s participation in these plans for the year ended December 31, 2020, is outlined in the table below. The \u201cEIN/Pension Plan Number\u201d column provides the Employer Identification Number and the three-digit plan number, if applicable. Unless otherwise noted, the most recent Pension Protection Act zone status available in 2020 is for the plan\u2019s year-end at December 31, 2019. The zone status is based on information that the Company received from the plan and is certified by the plan\u2019s actuary. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80% funded, and plans in the green zone are at least 80% funded. The \u201cFIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented\u201d column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (FIP) or a rehabilitation plan (RP) is either pending or has been implemented. The last column lists the expiration date(s) of the collective-bargaining agreement(s) to which the plans are subject.\nKirk and Blum was listed in the Sheet Metal Workers Local No. 177 Pension Fund\u2019s Form 5500 as providing more than five percent of total contributions for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company was not listed in any of the other plans\u2019 Forms 5500 as\nproviding more than five percent of the total contributions for the plans and plan years. At the date the financial statements were issued, Forms 5500 were not available for the plan years ended December 31, 2020.\nWe have no current intention of withdrawing from any plan and, therefore, no liability has been provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nAmounts charged to pension expense under the above plans including the multi-employer plans totaled $1.0 million, $1.7 million and $1.4 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe have a 401(k) savings retirement plan for employees of certain of our subsidiaries. The plan covers substantially all employees who have 30 days of service, and who have attained 18 years of age. The plan allows us to make discretionary contributions and provides for employee salary deferrals of up to 100%. We made aggregate matching contributions and discretionary contributions of $1.6 million, $1.7 million, and $1.7 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n11.\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting guidance, ASC 842. The guidance establishes a right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Our leasing activity is primarily related to buildings used for manufacturing, warehousing, sales, and administrative activities. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Many of our lease agreements contain renewal options; however, we do not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for renewal periods unless it is determined that we are reasonably certain of renewing the lease at inception or when a triggering event occurs. Some of our lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses, free-rent periods, or other lease concessions. We recognize our minimum rental expense on a straight-line basis based on the fixed components of a lease arrangement. Variable lease costs represent amounts that are not fixed in nature and are not tied to an index or rate, and are recognized as incurred. Our variable lease costs are not material.\nIn determining our ROU assets and lease liabilities, we apply a discount rate to the minimum lease payments within each lease agreement. ASU 2016-02 requires us to use the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. When we cannot readily determine the discount rate implicit in the lease agreement, we utilize our fully collateralized incremental borrowing rate. To estimate our specific incremental borrowing rates we consider, among other factors, interest rates on our existing credit facilities, risk-free rates, the types of assets being leased, and the term of the leases.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020, maturities of lease liabilities were as follows:\n12.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nAsbestos cases\nOur subsidiary, Met-Pro, beginning in 2002 began to be named in asbestos-related lawsuits filed against a large number of industrial companies including, in particular, those in the pump and fluid handling industries. In management\u2019s opinion, the complaints typically have been vague, general and speculative, alleging that Met-Pro, along with the numerous other defendants, sold unidentified asbestos-containing products and engaged in other related actions which caused injuries (including death) and loss to the plaintiffs. Counsel has advised that more recent cases typically allege more serious claims of mesothelioma. The Company\u2019s insurers have hired attorneys who, together with the Company, are vigorously defending these cases. Many cases have been dismissed after the plaintiff fails to produce evidence of exposure to Met-Pro\u2019s products. In those cases, where evidence has been produced, the Company\u2019s experience has been that the exposure levels are low and the Company\u2019s position has been that its products were not a cause of death,\ninjury or loss. The Company has been dismissed from or settled a large number of these cases. Cumulative settlement payments from 2002 through December 31, 2020 for cases involving asbestos-related claims were $3.1 million which together with all legal fees other than corporate counsel expenses; $2.9 million have been paid by the Company\u2019s insurers. The average cost per settled claim, excluding legal fees, was approximately $34,000.\nBased upon the most recent information available to the Company regarding such claims, there were a total of 200 cases pending against the Company as of December 31, 2020 (with Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia having the largest number of cases), as compared with 209 cases that were pending as of December 31, 2019. During 2020, 77 new cases were filed against the Company, and the Company was dismissed from 81 cases and settled 5 cases. Most of the pending cases have not advanced beyond the early stages of discovery, although a number of cases are on schedules leading to or are scheduled for trial. The Company believes that its insurance coverage is adequate for the cases currently pending against the Company and for the foreseeable future, assuming a continuation of the current volume, nature of cases and settlement amounts. However, the Company has no control over the number and nature of cases that are filed against it, nor as to the financial health of its insurers or their position as to coverage. The Company also presently believes that none of the pending cases will have a material adverse impact upon the Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.\nOther\nThe Company is also a party to routine contract and employment-related litigation matters and routine audits of state and local tax returns arising in the ordinary course of its business.\nThe final outcome and impact of open matters, and related claims and investigations that may be brought in the future, are subject to many variables, and cannot be predicted. In accordance with ASC 450, \u201cContingencies,\u201d and related guidance, we record reserves for estimated losses relating to claims and lawsuits when available information indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. The Company expenses legal costs as they are incurred.\nWe are not aware of pending claims or assessments, other than as described above, which may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n13.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome (loss) before income taxes was generated in the United States and globally as follows:\nCertain of the Company\u2019s undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries are not permanently reinvested, as management intends to repatriate foreign-held cash as needed to meet domestic cash needs for operating, investing, and financing activities. A liability of $0.9 million has been recorded for the deferred taxes on such undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2020. The deferred taxes are attributable primarily to the foreign withholding taxes that would become payable should the Company repatriate cash held in its foreign operations.\nIncome tax expense (benefit) consisted of the following for the years ended December 31:\nThe income tax expense (benefit) differs from the statutory rate due to the following:\nDeferred income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and tax credit carry forwards. The net deferred tax liabilities consisted of the following at December 31:\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company has federal net operating loss carry forwards of $0.6 million. Federal net operating losses of $0.1 million will expire in 2037. The remaining net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely until the loss is fully recovered. State and local net operating loss carry forwards total $49.4 million, which expire from 2021 to 2040. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance on certain of these net operating loss carry forwards to reflect expected realization. The Company also has net operating loss carry forwards in foreign jurisdictions totaling $10.3 million. A full valuation allowance has been established against substantially all of these losses in foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has recorded a valuation reserve in the amount of $6.0 million and $5.8 million, respectively. The changes in the valuation allowance resulted in additional income tax expense (benefit) of $(0.2) million, $0.2 million, and $1.5 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carry forward periods), projected future taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on this assessment, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances at December 31, 2020. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 740. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of uncertain tax position reserves included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows:\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The reserve for uncertain tax positions includes zero and $0.1 million of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The favorable settlement of all uncertain tax positions would impact the Company\u2019s effective income tax rate. Tax years going back to 2015 remain open for all significant state and foreign authorities.\n14.\nRelated Party Transactions\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018 we paid fees of $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, for consulting services to Icarus, through which Jason DeZwirek, our Chairman of our Board, provides services. The services described above are based on a verbal agreement with the Company. The Board of Directors approves the above services on an annual basis.\n15.\nAcquisitions and Joint Ventures\nEnvironmental Integrated Solutions\nOn June 4, 2020, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of Environmental Integrated Solutions (\u201cEIS\u201d) for $10.3 million in cash, which was financed with an additional draw on our revolving credit facility. As additional consideration, the former owners are entitled to earnout payments based upon a multiple of specified financial results through December 31, 2021. Based on projections at the acquisition date, the Company estimated the fair value of the earnout to be $0.6 million. During 2020, the Company increased earnout to $1.7 million at December 31, 2020 based on the estimated fair value at that date. Of this change, $1.2 million is recorded as expense in \u201cAmortization and earnout expenses\u201d on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The change in fair value was a result of EIS performing above initial acquisition operational expectations. The earnout liability is recorded in \u201cAccounts payable and accrued expenses\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nEIS engineers products that clean air through a variety of technologies including volatile organic compounds (\u201cVOC\u201d) abatement, odor control, regenerative thermal oxidizers, and other air pollution control solutions, which complements our Industrial Solutions Segment businesses. The following table summarizes the approximate fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of closing.\nGoodwill recognized represents value the Company expects to be created by combining the various operations of the acquired businesses with the Company\u2019s operations, including the expansion into markets within existing business segments, access to new customers and potential cost savings and synergies. Goodwill related to this acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.\nThe Company acquired customer lists and tradename intangible assets valued at $4.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively. These assets were determined to have useful lives of 10 years.\nAcquisition and integration expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations are related to acquisition activities, which include retention, legal, accounting, banking, and other expenses. During 2020, EIS accounted for $8.1 million in revenue and $(0.8) million of pre-tax loss (inclusive of the earnout adjustment noted above).\nMader\nOn July 31, 2020, the Company entered into the JV Agreement with Mader in which CECO contributed the net assets of its Effox-Flextor damper business and Mader contributed the net assets of their damper business. Under the terms of the JV Agreement, CECO will hold 70% of the equity in the joint venture, and 50% voting interest. We determined CECO was the primary beneficiary of this variable interest entity and therefore the 30% noncontrolling equity interest is in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The results of the joint venture are included in our Energy Segment. The fair value of Mader\u2019s net assets contributed was $1.0 million. As of December 31, 2020 there were $6.4 million in current assets, $8.9 million in long-lived assets, and $7.6 million in total liabilities related to the Effox-Mader joint venture included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Since formation, the joint venture has accounted for $7.7 million in revenue and $(0.2) million of pre-tax loss.\nThe following table summarizes the approximate fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the JV agreement date.\nGoodwill recognized represents value the Company expects to be created by combining the various operations of the joint venture with the Company\u2019s operations, including the expansion into markets within existing business segments, access to new customers and potential cost savings and synergies. Goodwill related to this joint venture is not deductible for tax purposes.\nThe approximate fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the above acquisition and joint venture are based on preliminary estimates and assumptions. These preliminary estimates and assumptions could change significantly during the purchase price measurement period as we finalize the valuations of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such changes could result in material variances between the Company\u2019s future financial results, including variances in the estimated purchase price, fair values recorded and expenses associated with these items.\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information represents the Company\u2019s results of operations as if the EIS acquisition and the joint venture with Mader had occurred on January 1, 2019:\nThe pro forma results have been prepared for informational purposes only and include adjustments to amortize acquired intangible assets with finite life, reflect additional interest expense on debt used to fund the acquisition, and to record the income tax consequences of the pro forma adjustments. These pro forma results do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the purchase been made as of the beginning of the periods presented or of the results of operations that may occur in the future.\n16.Divestitures\nStrobic Air Corporation\nOn March 30, 2018, the Company completed the sale of Strobic Air Corporation (\u201cStrobic\u201d) as part of its strategic decision to exit brands that do not align with the CECO portfolio to increase focus on better serving the energy and industrial solutions and fluid handling markets. The sales price was $28.5 million, subject to post-closing purchase price adjustments. The disposition resulted in a gain of $6.9 million, comprised of $27.9 million of net proceeds received as consideration after post-closing purchase price adjustments less net assets disposed of $18.8 million and transaction costs of $2.2 million. The net assets disposed of are primarily comprised of $13.0 million of goodwill, $2.3 million of definite-lived intangible assets and $1.2 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets allocated to the Strobic business. Strobic results through the date of disposition are included within income before income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and are reported within the Fluid Handling Solutions segment. The sale of Strobic did not constitute a significant strategic shift that will have a material impact on the Company\u2019s ongoing operations and financial results.\nKeystone Filter\nOn February 28, 2018, the Company completed the sale of the Keystone Filter brand (\u201cKeystone\u201d) as part of its strategic decision to exit brands that do not align with the CECO portfolio to increase focus on better serving energy and industrial solutions and fluid handling markets. The sales price was $7.5 million, subject to post-closing purchase price adjustments. The disposition resulted in a gain of $4.3 million, comprised of $7.2 million of net proceeds after post-closing purchase price adjustments less net assets disposed of $2.7 million and transaction costs of $0.2 million. Keystone results are reported within the Fluid Handling Solutions segment through the date of disposition.\nZhongli\nOn November 27, 2018, the Company completed the sale of Jiangyin Zhongli Industrial Technology Co. Ltd (\u201cZhongli\u201d), a business in our Energy Solutions segment operating in China, for a price of $3.6 million. In the third quarter of 2018, we classified the assets and liabilities of Zhongli as held-for-sale. In connection with classifying this business as held-for-sale, GAAP required us to assess impairment by comparing the estimated selling price, less cost to sell to our carrying value in Zhongli. Based on this analysis, we recorded a $15.1 million loss. In 2019, the Company finalized a tax position related to the future carryback of the capital loss recognized in connection with the divestiture, resulting in a $4.4 million income tax benefit. The disposal of this business does not constitute a significant strategic shift that will have a material impact on the Company\u2019s ongoing operations and financial results. Zhongli results are reported within the Energy Solutions segment through the date of disposition.\n17.\nBusiness Segment Information\nThe Company\u2019s operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines or end markets that the segment serves and are presented in three reportable segments. The results of the segments are reviewed through to the \u201cIncome from operations\u201d line on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those in the consolidated financial statements.
