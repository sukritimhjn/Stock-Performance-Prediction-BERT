    "item_1": "Item 1.\nBUSINESS\nGeneral\nButler National Corporation (\u201cButler National\u201d the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, or \u201cour\u201d) was incorporated in 1960. Our companies design, engineer, manufacture, sell, integrate, install, repair, modify, overhaul, service and distribute a broad portfolio of aerostructures, aircraft components, avionics, accessories, subassemblies and systems (\u201cAerospace Products\u201d). We serve a broad, worldwide spectrum of the aviation industry, including owners and operators, of single-engine, commercial, regional, business and military aircraft. In addition, our companies provide management services in the gaming industry (\u201cProfessional Services\u201d).\nProducts and Services\nThe Company has two operating segments for financial reporting purposes: (a) Aerospace Products, whose companies\u2019 revenues are derived from system design, engineering, manufacturing, sale, distribution, integration, installation, repairing, modifying, overhauling and servicing of aerostructures, avionics, aircraft components, accessories, subassemblies and systems; and (b) Professional Services, whose companies provide professional management services in the gaming industry, and professional architectural and engineering services.\nAerospace Products.

The Professional Services segment includes the management of a gaming facility and related dining and entertainment facilities in Dodge City, Kansas. Boot Hill Casino and Resort features approximately 640 slot machines and 20 table games. Companies in Professional Services also provide licensed architectural services, including commercial and industrial building design, and engineering services.\nBoot Hill. Butler National Service Corporation (\u201cBNSC\u201d), and BHCMC, LLC (\u201cBHCMC\u201d), a company in Professional Services, has managed The Boot Hill Casino and Resort in Dodge City, Kansas (\u201cBoot Hill\u201d) since 2009 pursuant to the Lottery Gaming Facility Management Contract, by and among BNSC, BHCMC and the Kansas Lottery, originally dated December 8, 2009, as subsequently amended (\u201cBoot Hill Agreement\u201d). As required by Kansas law, all games, gaming equipment and gaming operations at Boot Hill are owned and operated by the Kansas Lottery.\nThe Stables. From 1998 until 2018, Butler National Service Corporation, a company in Professional Services and our wholly-owned subsidiary, managed a Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma owned casino known as The Stables Casino in Miami, Oklahoma (\u201cThe Stables\u201d) pursuant to the Stables Management Agreement originally dated December 12, 1996 and approved by the NIGC on January 14, 1997 as subsequently amended (the \u201cStables Agreement\u201d). Under the terms of the Stables Agreement, BNSC received twenty percent (20%) of the net profits from The Stables. The Stables Agreement expired on September 30, 2018, and was not renewed.\nArchitectural and Engineering Services. Companies in Professional Services provide licensed architectural, including commercial and industrial building design, and engineering services.\nBHC Investment Company, LC (\"BHCI\") owns 100% of the Class A Preferred Interest in BHCMC, LLC. BNSC owns 100% of the Class B Preferred Interest. The ownership structure of BHCMC, LLC is:\nProprietary Rights\nWe do not currently hold any patents, franchises or concessions. In our overhaul and repair business, original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) of equipment that we maintain for our customers often include language in repair manuals that relate to their equipment, asserting broad claims of proprietary rights to the contents of the manuals used in our operations. There can be no assurance that OEMs will not try to enforce such claims, including the possible use of legal proceedings. In the event of such legal proceedings, there can be no assurance that such actions against the Company will be unsuccessful. However, we believe that our use of OEM manufacture and repair manuals is lawful.\nSeasonality\nOur Aerospace Products businesses are generally not seasonal. We believe that our Professional Services businesses, however, are subject to seasonality based on local weather conditions, agricultural and petroleum prices, employment levels and the travel habits of visitors in the market service area.\nRaw Materials and Replacement Parts\nWe purchase raw materials, primarily consisting of sheet and plate aluminum, from various vendors. We also purchase replacement parts, which are utilized in our various repair and overhaul operations. We believe that the availability of raw materials to us is adequate to support our Aerospace Products operations.\nBacklog\nOur backlog as of April 30, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\nOur backlog as of July 10, 2020 totaled $19,204; consisting of $18,757 and $447, respectively, for Aerospace Products and Professional Services. The backlog includes firm pending and contract orders, which may not be completed within the next fiscal year. A portion of this backlog may be delivered after fiscal year 2021. This is standard for the industry in which modifications services and related contracts may take several months or years to complete. Such actions force backlog as additional customers request modifications, but must wait for other projects to be completed. There can be no assurance that all orders will be completed or that some may ever commence.\nDependence on Significant Customers\nDuring the fiscal year ending April 30, 2020 we derived 37.3% of our revenue from five customers, and we had two \"major customers\" (10 percent or more of consolidated revenue) that provided 21.2% and 11.4% of total revenue.\nCompetition\nWe compete in the aerospace and casino gaming industries. In the aerospace industry, we compete against peer companies of which some are divisions or subsidiaries of other large companies, in the manufacture of aircraft structures, systems components, subassemblies, detail parts and aircraft modifications. Competition for the repair and overhaul of aviation components comes from three primary sources, some of whom possess greater financial and other resources than we have: OEMs, governmental support depots, and other independent repair and overhaul companies. OEMs also maintain service centers which provide repair and overhaul services for the components they manufacture. Many governments maintain aircraft support depots in their military organizations that maintain and repair the aircraft they operate. Other independent service organizations also compete for the repair and overhaul business. Participants in the aerospace industry compete primarily based on size of business and technical capabilities, quality, turnaround time, capacity and price.\nThe casino entertainment business is highly competitive. The industry is comprised of a diverse group of competitors that vary considerably in size and geographic diversity, quality of facilities and amenities available, marketing and growth strategies and financial condition. In the Kansas and Oklahoma region, we compete with other casino facilities in the region. We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation destinations, various other entertainment businesses, and other forms of gaming, such as state lotteries, on-track and off-track wagering, video lottery terminals and card parlors.\nGovernment Regulation and Industry Oversight\nThe aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States by the FAA and in other countries by similar agencies. We must be certified by the FAA to design, engineer, test and certify replacement and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models.\nWe must also satisfy the requirements of our customers that are subject to FAA regulations, and provide these customers with products and repair services that comply with the applicable government regulations. The FAA regulates flight operations and requires that aircraft components meet FAA stringent standards. In addition, the FAA requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components. We currently satisfy these maintenance standards allowing component repair and overhaul services at our FAA-approved repair stations.\nGenerally, the FAA only grants licenses for the manufacture or repair of a specific aircraft component, rather than the broader licenses that have been granted in the past. The FAA licensing process may be costly and time-consuming. To obtain an FAA license, an applicant must satisfy all applicable regulations of the FAA governing repair stations. These regulations require that an applicant have experienced personnel, inspection systems, suitable facilities and equipment. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate a need for the license. Because an applicant must procure manufacturing and repair manuals relating to each particular aircraft component in order to obtain a license with respect to that component, the application process may involve substantial time and cost.\nOur Professional Services businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning employment, alcoholic beverages, food service, smoking, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws. For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, or OSHA, mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees in the United States. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with OSHA's health and safety requirements.\nMoreover, the gaming industry is highly regulated and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each gaming facility is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations where it is located. These laws, rules and regulations generally relate to the responsibility, financial stability, integrity and character of the owners, managers and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations.\nEmployees\nOther than persons employed by our gaming management subsidiaries there were 107 full time and 7 part time employees on April 30, 2020 compared to 100 full time and 4 part time employees on April 30, 2019. As of July 10, 2020, staffing was 111 full time and 9 part time employees. Our staffing at Boot Hill Casino on April 30, 2020 was 187 full time and 67 part time employees and 180 full time employees and 66 part time employees on April 30, 2019. As of July 10, 2020 our staffing at Boot Hill Casino was 179 full time employees and 64 part time employees.\nNone of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant\nOur current executive officers are:\nOfficers are elected by the Board of Directors of Butler National Corporation and serve at the discretion of the Board. All of the officers of the Company are subject to an employment agreement with the Company.\nAvailable Information\nFor more information about us, visit our website at www.butlernational.com.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following statements on risk factors contain \"forward looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as \"could,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"intended,\" \"continue,\" \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"expect,\" \"hope,\" \"anticipate,\" \"goal,\" \"forecast,\" \"plan,\" \"guidance\" or \"estimate\" or the negative of these words, variations thereof or similar expressions. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or result and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Stockholders should be aware of certain risks, including those described below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which could adversely affect the value of their holdings and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in future operating results, financial condition or business over time.\nWe face extensive regulation across our industries, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and limit the prospect of new shareholders acquiring our shares.\nOur Aerospace business is subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\"). We manufacture products and parts under FAA Parts Manufacturing Authority requiring qualification and traceability of all materials and vendors used by us. We make aircraft modifications pursuant to the authority granted by Supplemental Type Certificates issued by the FAA. We repair aircraft parts pursuant to the authority granted by our FAA Authorized Repair Station. New or more stringent government regulations may be adopted in the future. Related costs of compliance with or liability for violations of existing or future regulations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nGaming licenses and/or background investigations (\"license\") are required in connection with our management of a State of Kansas owned Lottery Gaming Facility (a casino). Our management personnel, Butler National and/or the managing subsidiaries, the key personnel of all entities may be required to have a state-issued gaming license. Moreover, our present and future stockholders are, and will continue to be, subject to review by regulatory agencies. The failure of the Company or the key personnel to obtain or retain a license could have a material adverse effect on the Company or on its ability to obtain or retain these licenses in other jurisdictions. Each such State Gaming Agency has broad discretion in granting, renewing, and revoking licenses. Obtaining such licenses and approvals will be time consuming and may be unsuccessful or involve considerable expense, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully operate our business.\nThe State of Kansas has approved state-owned Lottery Gaming Facilities, pari-mutuel dog and/or horse racing for non-Indian organizations. The State of Kansas operates a state lottery, keno games and state-owned Lottery Gaming Facilities for the benefit of the State. The Lottery Gaming Facility management contract approval process requires that any entity or person owning directly or indirectly one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the ownership interest of the management company must be found suitable to be an owner by the State of Kansas.\nIf found unsuitable by any Agency, the stockholder must offer all of the interest in Company stock held by such stockholder to the Company for cash at the current market bid price less a fifteen percent (15%) administrative charge and the Company must purchase such Interest within six (6) months of the offer. The stockholder is required to pay all costs of investigation with respect to a determination of his/her suitability. In addition, regardless of ownership, each member of the Board of Directors and certain officers of the Company are subject to a finding of suitability by any Agency on a regular basis.\nWe are subject to evolving government regulation and law, which may adversely affect our business.\nGaming management operations are and will be subject to extensive gaming laws and regulations, many of which were recently adopted and have not been the subject of definitive interpretations and are still subject to proposed amendments and regulation. The political and regulatory environment in which the Company is and will be operating, with respect to gaming activities, is dynamic and rapidly changing. Adoption and/or changes in gaming laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. Interference with the execution of the steps defined by the gaming laws and regulations by interested third parties, although not included by the regulations, may interfere with and or significantly slow the approval process.\nWe may face risks related to the geographic location of our casino.\nBoot Hill Casino is located in Dodge City, Kansas. Consequently, a significant portion of our gaming business is subject to the general economic health of the region around Dodge City, Kansas. The economy of Dodge City, Kansas is significantly influenced by the agricultural sector of the national and local economy, which includes both agricultural farming but also meat processing. As a result, changes in the economic climate, weather patterns, and market fluctuations for agricultural and petroleum products could negatively influence our revenues from gaming and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur Aerospace business is subject to significant customer concentration risk.\nDuring the fiscal year ending April 30, 2020 we derived 37.3% of our revenue from five customers, and we had two \"major customers\" (10 percent or more of consolidated revenue) that provided 21.2% and 11.4% of total revenue. A loss of business from, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of, one or more of these major customers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe are attempting to purchase land at Boot Hill Casino and face risks associated with the potential acquisition.\nThe Company currently leases the Boot Hill Casino building and the land on which it is located (\u201cReal Estate\u201d) under the terms of a twenty-five (25) year lease agreement with BHC Development L.C. Under this lease agreement, the Company holds an option to purchase the Real Estate. The Company continues to explore the possibility of purchasing such Real Estate and is currently considering multiple financing options to fund the acquisition. The potential acquisition runs the risk of being delayed by numerous factors outside of our control. There exists the risk the acquisition of Real Estate may not happen at all. The Company may not be able to obtain the necessary financing to fund the acquisition on favorable terms. After the closing of any such acquisition of Real Estate, the Company may not realize the potential benefits of the purchase and may be obligated to navigate burdensome debt obligations. Both the failure to close the Real Estate acquisition and the possible risks stemming from completing such a transaction, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe operate in a cyclical industry and an economic downturn could negatively impact our operations.\nHistorically, adverse conditions in the local, regional, national and global economies have negatively affected our operations, and may continue to negatively affect our operations in the future. During periods of economic contraction, our revenues may decrease while some of our costs remain fixed or even increase, resulting in decreased earnings.\nThe gaming activities that we offer represent discretionary expenditures and participation in such activities may decline during economic downturns, during which consumers generally earn less disposable income. Even an uncertain economic outlook may adversely affect consumer spending in our gaming operations and related facilities, as consumers spend less in anticipation of a potential economic downturn.\nOur Aerospace business activities and operations are subject to the general health of the aviation industry, which can be cyclical. During periods of economic expansion, when capital spending normally increases, we generally benefit from greater demand for our aviation products and services. During periods of economic contraction, when capital spending normally decreases, we generally are adversely affected by declining demand for our Aerospace products and services. Aviation industry conditions are impacted by numerous factors over which we have no control, including political, regulatory, economic and military conditions, environmental concerns, weather conditions and fuel pricing. Any prolonged cyclical downturn could have a material adverse effect on our Aerospace business, and the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe operate in competitive markets, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business.\nIncreased competition, including the entry of new competitors, the introduction of new products by new and existing competitors or price competition, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. Additionally, because of the rapid rate at which the gaming industry has expanded, and continues to expand, the gaming industry may be at risk of market saturation, both as to specific areas and generally. Overbuilding of gaming facilities by others at particular sites in competitive markets may have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete and on our operations. Competition for the disposable income dollars from the State of Kansas through the Kansas Lottery operating ilottery and sports betting may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBecause our common stock is deemed a low-priced \"Penny\" stock, an investment in our common stock should be considered high risk and subject to marketability restrictions.\nSince our common stock is a penny stock, as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act, it will be more difficult for investors to liquidate their investment. Until the trading price of the common stock increases so that it no longer qualifies as a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d if ever, trading in the common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the Exchange Act. Those rules require broker-dealers, before effecting transactions in any penny stock, to:\n\u25cf\nDeliver to the customer, and obtain a written receipt for, a disclosure document;\n\u25cf\nDisclose certain price information about the stock;\n\u25cf\nDisclose the amount of compensation received by the broker-dealer or any associated person of the broker-dealer;\n\u25cf\nSend monthly statements to customers with market and price information about the penny stock; and\n\u25cf\nIn some circumstances, approve the purchaser's account under certain standards and deliver written statements to the customer with information specified in the rules.\nConsequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell the common stock and may affect the ability of holders to sell their common stock in the secondary market and the price at which such holders can sell any such securities. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nOur 401(k) profit sharing plan results in new shares being issued each year, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nSubject to the annual approval of the Board of Directors, 100% of every pre-tax dollar an employee contributes, up to 6% of the employee\u2019s salary, and a portion of the Company\u2019s profits is matched by the Company. Employees are 100% vested in the Company\u2019s contributions immediately and our matching contribution, as approved by the Board of Directors is paid on an annual basis with common stock of the Company. Competitive retirement plans are a requirement for hiring and retention of employees in the Company\u2019s business segments. The Company\u2019s 401(k) profit sharing plan also encourages employee participation in the 401(k) plan and encourages overall loyalty to the Company. Matching employee contributions with common stock of the Company does lead to a dilution of outstanding common stock, which may result in a lower trading price of our common stock in the future. Historically the Company has attempted to mitigate this dilutive effect by repurchasing the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock through stock buy-back plans; however, the effectiveness of stock buy-back plans is limited due to volume and timing restrictions found in Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. Stock repurchase plans are also subject to reauthorization by the Board of Directors from time to time and the Company\u2019s available cash flow.\nWe may conduct a reverse-stock split, which could expose us to certain risks.\nThe possibility of the Company undergoing a reverse-stock split has been discussed at prior annual meetings as a means to increase the common stock share price. We operate in competitive industries and the Company must consider all strategies to increase our common stock share price for stockholders. A reverse stock-split and subsequent increase in the common stock price could elicit a positive market reaction and attract new investors to the Company. There are also risks with a reverse stock-split. The market could react negatively to the consolidation and our common stock could come under renewed selling pressure, which would negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe face risks associated with having executive officers who are family members.\nOur executive team is made up of four (4) individuals who have extensive industry and general business experience. This includes Clark D. Stewart, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Clark\u2019s son, Craig D. Stewart, Vice President. Companies with multiple family members serving on the same executive team can be predisposed to unique internal conflicts, nepotism and/or strategic family alliances. In light of the family relationship within the executive officers of the Company, certain prospective investors may be unwilling to purchase our common stock, which may have a negative effect on our share price.\nChanges in governmental regulations of financial reporting could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nThe Company reports information to its stockholders and the general public pursuant to the regulations of various Federal and State Commissions and Agencies. These regulations require conformance by the Company to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, to pronouncements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\"PCAOB\"), and to accounting and reporting directives issued by the commissions and agencies. The political and regulatory environment in which the Company operates is dynamic and rapidly changing, and adoption and/or changes in regulations defining accounting procedures or reporting requirements could increase expenditures to report required financial information, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe face risks related to fluctuating fuel and energy costs.\nOur business depends on the use of aircraft fuel for business transportation, freight transportation, and special mission applications. Fluctuations in the global supply of crude oil and the possibility of changes in government policy on aircraft fuel production make it impossible to predict the future availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel. Depending on various global factors that are out of our control, there could be reductions in the production or importation of crude oil and significant increases in the cost of aircraft fuel. This could deter our customers from purchasing fuel and/or inhibit their ability to pass on disproportionate costs to their customers. As a result, the use of business and military aircrafts, the value of aircraft related assets and the revenue related to aircraft equipment and aircraft modifications could decrease. These potential consequences from fluctuating fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur gaming business also depends on the use of automotive fuels for travel to our casino locations in agricultural communities. Increased fuel prices could cause our customers to determine that fuel is not available or too expensive to justify travel, which may cause our gaming business to be adversely affected.\nWe face risks due to our fixed-price contracts.\nWe sell certain products and services to commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing for fixed units prices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The costs of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, and other unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results. Increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nDifficulties or delays in the development, production, testing and marketing of products, could adversely affect our business.\nOur Aerospace business is subject, in part, to regulatory procedures and administration enacted by and/or administered by the FAA. Accordingly, our business may be adversely affected in the event the Company is unable to comply with such regulations relative to its current products and/or if any new products and/or services to be offered by the Company are not formally approved by such agency. Our proposed aviation modification products depend upon the issuance by the FAA of a Supplemental Type Certificate with related parts manufacturing authority. Such certifications for future aircraft modification products may not be issued within our expected time frames or issued at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, the loss of one or more of our current licenses or certifications could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur business requires financing and financing is dependent upon the stability of economic markets.\nThe Company depends upon financial institutions for financing to continue operations and to finance and develop new opportunities. The status of the national economy and its growth outlook could be affected by volatility and/or a disruption of capital and credit markets, which could negatively impact our financial performance and our ability to access credit financing. As a result, we may not be able to secure credit financing on terms attractive to us and if we are able to secure financing arrangements, the amount may be insufficient to meet all of our current and future needs to continue operations and finance and develop new opportunities.\nCyber-security threats or other disruptions to our technology infrastructure could harm our business.\nOur use of electronic data storage, automated systems and technology gives rise to cyber-security risks. Although we and our third-party providers have preventive systems and processes in place designed to protect against the risk of system failure and cyber-attacks, a security breach of our systems or those of our third-party providers may cause a disruption of our business or expose us to a loss of information or litigation which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and results of operations.\nActs of terrorism and war could disrupt our business.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility create many economic and political uncertainties. We cannot predict the extent to which terrorism, security alerts, war, or hostilities throughout the world will continue to directly or indirectly impact our business and operating results. Because of the threat of terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility in the future, premiums for certain insurance products have increased, and some types of insurance are no longer available. Given current conditions in the global insurance markets, we are substantially uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war. If any such event were to affect our properties, it would likely adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nInclement weather, natural disasters and other conditions could seriously disrupt our business and operations.\nOur gaming operations are subject to the weather and other conditions that could disrupt or reduce the number of customers who visit our casino. If weather conditions limit consumer access to our casino or otherwise adversely impact our ability to operate our casino at full capacity, our revenue could suffer, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe also face risks that the weather and other conditions could adversely affect the local industries in Dodge City, Kansas, where the Boot Hill Casino is located. The local economy in Dodge City is primarily fueled by the agriculture, meat processing and oil and gas industries. In the event the weather and/or other conditions severely disrupt these industries, we could see a reduction in the number of customers who visit our casino, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results in operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nIn addition, natural disasters such as major fires, floods, tornados and earthquakes could also adversely impact our business and operating results. Such events could lead to the loss of use of one or more of the facilities for which we provide management services for an extended period of time and disrupt our ability to attract customers to certain of our gaming facilities. If any such event were to affect our properties, we would likely be adversely impacted.\nIn most situations, we have insurance that should provide coverage for portions of any losses from a natural disaster, but it is subject to deductibles and maximum payouts in many cases. Although we may be covered by insurance from a natural disaster, the timing of our receipt of insurance proceeds, if any, is beyond our control.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 has impacted our business and is expected to cause further disruptions to our business, financial performance and operating results.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 in recent months has negatively impacted the global and U.S. economy and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets. The impact of this pandemic has also created significant uncertainty in the global and U.S. economy and has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, employees, suppliers, and customers. We have experienced a decrease in the number of patrons at our Boot Hill Casino & Resort since the start of the pandemic, which may continue for the foreseeable future. Additionally, the pandemic has affected the Company's ability to acquire the Boot Hill Casino building and related land. Demand for our aircraft modification business may decrease in correlation to the general health of the U.S. economy. The duration and the magnitude of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be precisely estimated at this time, as they are affected by a number of rapidly changing factors, many of which are outside of our control, which include, among others, state and local regulations, the infection rate among persons in the region surrounding the Boot Hill Casino & Resort, and potential treatment options for those that are sick. The continued impact on our business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (directly or indirectly) could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows in the near-term and beyond fiscal 2021.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur inability to retain key personnel may be critical to our ability to achieve our objectives. Key personnel are particularly important in maintaining relationships with the operations related to the FAA and the State of Kansas. Loss of any such personnel could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur success depends heavily upon the continued contributions of these key persons, whose knowledge, leadership and technical expertise would be difficult to replace, and on our ability to attract and retain experienced professional staff. While we currently have an employment agreement with our CEO, Clark D. Stewart, if we were to lose the services of Mr. Stewart or other key persons, our ability to execute our business plan would be harmed and we may be forced to cease operations until such time as we could hire suitable replacements.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with our international sales.\nOur international sales may be subject to local government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices which may differ from U.S. Federal Government regulation, including regulations related to products being installed on aircraft, exchange controls, as well to varying currency, geo-political and economic risks. We are also exposed to risks associated with any relationships with foreign representatives, consultants, partners and suppliers for international sales and operations. Our ability to arrange safe travel to visit our international customers may put our ability to sell such customers at risk, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nFuture acquisitions and investments may expose us to certain risks.\nWe continually review, evaluate and consider potential investments and acquisitions in pursuing our business strategy. In evaluating such transactions, we are making difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risk and cost of potential liabilities. Acquisitions and investments involve certain other risks and uncertainties, including the difficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses, the challenges in reaching our strategic objectives, benefits expected from acquisitions or investments, cost and revenue synergies, and risk that markets do not evolve as anticipated and the targeted opportunity or technology do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets. Other risks include the diversion of our attention and resources from our current operations, the potential of impairment of acquired assets and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses.\nWe are subject to certain change of control restrictions, which could make it more difficult to be acquired.\nSome provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and our Shareholder Rights Agreement could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. This includes, but is not limited to, provisions that: provide for a classified Board of Directors, prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent, and restrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings. We are also subject to provisions of Kansas law K.S.A. 17-6427 that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless certain conditions are met, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control. In light of the highly regulated nature of our business and the authority of the regulatory agencies that monitor business to monitor the composition of our shareholders, the Board has consistently believed these restrictions are appropriate. Nonetheless, these restrictions may result in missed opportunities for the Company and could result in a reduced share price of our common stock, which would harm our business.\nWe may be required in the future to record impairment losses related to assets we currently carry on our balance sheet.\nWe evaluate intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and in any interim period in which circumstances arise that indicate our intangible asset may be impaired. Indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to, the loss of significant business and/or significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions. No events occurred during the periods presented indicated the existence of an impairment with respect to our intangible assets. Preparation of forecasts for use in the long-range plan and the selection of the discount rate involve significant judgments that we base primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders and general market conditions. Significant changes in these forecasts or the discount rate selected could affect the estimated fair value and could result in an impairment charge in a future period.\nWe are subject to extensive taxation policies, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe federal government has, from time to time, considered a federal tax on casino revenues and may consider such a tax in the future. If such an increase were to be enacted, our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future to finance casino development projects could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees, in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time.\nBoot Hill Casino, pursuant to its Management Contract with the State of Kansas pays total taxes between 27% and 31% of gross gaming revenue, based on achievement of the following revenue levels: 27% on gross gaming revenue up to $180 million, 29% on amounts from $180 million to $220 million, and 31% on amounts above $220 million in gross gaming revenue. Boot Hill Casino is contractually obligated to pay its proportionate share of certain expenses incurred by the Kansas Lottery Commission and the Kansas Racing and Gaming Commission, which amounted to $1.9 million during fiscal year ended April 30, 2020.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (Notes).\nOur fiscal year ends on April 30. Fiscal years 2020 and 2019 consisted of 52 weeks and ended on April 30, 2020 and April 30, 2019, respectively. All references to years in this MD&A represent fiscal years unless otherwise noted.\nManagement Overview\nManagement is focused on increasing long-term shareholder value from increased cash generation, earnings growth, and prudently managing capital expenditures. We plan to do this by continuing to drive increased revenues from product and service innovations, strategic acquisitions, and targeted marketing programs.\nWe have two separate reporting segments: Aerospace Products and Professional Services. Aerospace Products and Professional Services do not share the same customers and suppliers and have substantially distinct businesses. The Aerospace Products operating segment provides products and services in the aerospace industry. Companies in Aerospace Products derive their revenue from system design, engineering, manufacturing, integration, installation, repairing, overhauling, servicing and distribution of aerostructures, avionics, aircraft components, accessories, subassemblies and systems. The Professional Services operating segment provides services in the gaming industry. Professional Services companies manage a gaming and entertainment facility and provide architectural and engineering services. These reporting segments operate through various subsidiaries and affiliates listed on Exhibit 21 to this Form 10-K.\nCOVID-19 Overview:\nThe pandemic caused by the disease COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since spread throughout the world. Financial markets have been volatile in 2020, primarily due to uncertainty with respect to the severity and duration of the pandemic.\nThe pandemic has resulted in federal, state and local governments around the world implementing increasingly stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, \u201cshelter in place\u201d and \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, travel restrictions or bans, business curtailments, school closures, and other protective measures.\nOur aerospace segment qualified as \u201cessential\u201d under applicable federal guidance and state orders. The facilities have continued operations. We are enforcing social distancing and enhanced health, safety and sanitization measures in accordance with guidelines from the Center for Disease Control (the \u201cCDC\u201d).\nWe have also implemented necessary procedures and support to enable a significant portion of our Olathe headquarters personnel to work remotely.\nOur professional services operations at the Boot Hill Casino & Resort was forced to close from March 18, 2020 thru May 21, 2020. The casino reopened to the public on May 22, with reduced hours to allow for extra time for cleaning and sanitizing in accordance with CDC guidelines and limited number of games and food offerings. We are also continuing to enforce social distancing measures throughout the casinos. Since reopening the Boot Hill Casino & Resort we have experienced lower customer headcount, which has been partially off-set by a larger net revenue per customer. We are experiencing, and expect to continue experiencing, lower demand for our professional services and increased costs and other challenges related to COVID-19 that adversely affects our business.\nBHCMC, LLC, a subsidiary in the professional services segment, received a loan in the principal amount of $2,001,000 (the \u201cSBA Loan\u201d) under the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), which was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d). The intent and purpose of the PPP is to support companies during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing funds for certain specified business expenses, with a focus on payroll. We have used the proceeds from the SBA Loan to maintain our payroll and retain casino staff. With the assistance of the SBA Loan, we believe we have sufficient liquidity at this time to maintain our business operations during this difficult time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business operations and financial results beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and continues to impact us in fiscal 2021. Although the financial impact on our overall fiscal 2020 results is limited due to the timing of the outbreak, we face numerous uncertainties in estimating the direct and indirect effects on our present and future business operations, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Due to several rapidly changing variables related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot reasonably estimate future economic trends and the timing of when stability will return. Refer to Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a disclosure of risk factors related to COVID-19.\nResults Overview\nOur fiscal 2020 revenue increased 12% to $65.9 million compared to $58.7 million in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2020 the Professional Services revenue decreased 12%. There was an increase of 41% in the Aerospace Products revenue in fiscal 2020.\nOur fiscal 2020 net income was $3.2 million compared to net income of $5.7 million in fiscal 2019. Earnings per share was $0.06 for fiscal 2020 compared to $0.06 in fiscal 2019. We continue focusing on our margin expansion initiatives, including efficiencies in our implementation and operational processes and controlling general and administrative expenses. The fiscal 2020 operating income was 13%, an increase from 9% in fiscal 2019.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019\nRevenue:\nRevenue increased 12% to $65.9 million in fiscal 2020, compared to $58.7 million in fiscal 2019. See \"Operations by Segment\" below for a discussion of the primary reasons for the increase in revenue.\nProfessional Services derives its revenue from (a) professional management services in the gaming industry through Butler National Service Corporation (\"BNSC\") and BHCMC, LLC (\"BHCMC\"), and (b) professional architectural, engineering and management support services through BCS Design, Inc. (\"BCS\"). Revenue from Professional Services decreased 12% to $28.3 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $32.0 million in fiscal 2019. The decrease in revenue was caused by the casino being forced to close the last six weeks of the fiscal year due to COVID-19.\nAerospace Products derives its revenue by designing, engineering, manufacturing, installing, servicing and repairing products for classic and current production aircraft. Aerospace Products revenue increased 41% to $37.6 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $26.7 million in fiscal 2019.\nCosts and expenses:\nCosts and expenses related to Professional Services and Aerospace Products include the cost of engineering, labor, materials, equipment utilization, control systems, security and occupancy.\nCosts and expenses increased 8% in fiscal 2020 to $57.6 million compared to $53.4 million in fiscal 2019. Costs and expenses were 87% of total revenue in fiscal 2020, compared to 91% of total revenue in fiscal 2019.\nMarketing and advertising expenses as a percent of total revenue was 6% in fiscal 2020, as compared to 7% in fiscal 2019. These expenses decreased 2% to $4.1 million in fiscal 2020, from $4.2 million in fiscal 2019. Marketing and advertising expenses include advertising, sales and marketing labor, gaming development costs, and casino and product promotions.\nEmployee benefits expenses as a percent of total revenue was 4% in fiscal 2020, compared to 4% in fiscal 2019. These expenses increased 13% to $2.6 million in fiscal 2020, from $2.3 million in fiscal 2019. These expenses include the employers' share of all federal, state and local taxes, paid time off for vacation, holidays and illness, employee health and life insurance programs and employer matching contributions to retirement plans.\nDepreciation and amortization as a percent of total revenue was 8% in fiscal 2020, compared to 3% in fiscal 2019. These expenses increased to $5.1 million in fiscal 2020, from $1.8 million in fiscal 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 Leases, caused depreciation to increase by $2.8 million in fiscal 2020. These expenses include depreciation related to owned assets being depreciated over various useful lives and amortization of intangible items including the Kansas privilege fee related to the Boot Hill Casino being expensed over the term of the gaming contract with the State of Kansas. BHCMC, LLC depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal 2020 was $3.7 million compared to $1.0 million in fiscal 2019.\nGeneral, administrative and other expenses as a percent of total revenue was 11% in fiscal 2020, compared to 13% in fiscal 2019. These expenses decreased 6% to $7.3 million in fiscal 2020, from $7.8 million in fiscal 2019.\nOther income (expense):\nInterest and other income (expense) were ($3.7) million in fiscal 2020 compared with interest and other income (expense) of $1.7 million in fiscal 2019, an increase of $5.5 million, from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 Leases, caused interest expense to increase $4.2 million in fiscal 2020.\nOperations by Segment\nWe have two operating segments, Professional Services and Aerospace Products. The Professional Services segment includes revenue contributions and expenditures associated with casino management services and professional architectural, engineering and management support services. Aerospace Products derives its revenue by designing, engineering, manufacturing, installing, servicing and repairing products for classic and current production aircraft.\nThe following table presents a summary of our operating segment information for fiscal years 2020 and 2019:\nProfessional Services\n\u25cf\nRevenue from Professional Services decreased 12% to $28.3 million in fiscal 2020 from $32.0 million in fiscal 2019.\nIn fiscal 2020 Boot Hill Casino received gross receipts for the State of Kansas of $35.9 million compared to $41.6 million in fiscal 2019. Mandated fees, taxes and distributions reduced gross receipts by $11.6 million resulting in gaming revenue of $24.3 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $28.0 million in fiscal 2019, a decrease of 13%. Non-gaming revenue at Boot Hill Casino remained constant at $3.7 million in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019.\nThe remaining management and Professional Services revenue includes professional management services in the gaming industry, and licensed architectural services. Professional Services revenue excluding Boot Hill Casino increased 2% to $316 in fiscal 2020 compared to $311 in fiscal 2019.\n\u25cf\nCosts decreased 23% in fiscal 2020 to $15.5 million compared to $20.1 million in fiscal 2019. Costs were 55% of segment total revenue in fiscal 2020, compared to 62% of segment total revenue in fiscal 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 Leases, caused $4.9 million of the decrease from a reduction in rent expense in fiscal 2020.\n\u25cf\nExpenses increased 10% in fiscal 2020 to $11.5 million compared to $10.5 million in fiscal 2019. Expenses were 41% of segment total revenue in fiscal 2020, compared to 33% of segment total revenue in fiscal 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 Leases, caused depreciation to increase by $2.6 million in fiscal 2020.\nAerospace Products\n\u25cf\nRevenue increased 41% to $37.6 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $26.7 million in fiscal 2019. This $10.9 million increase was due to an increase in our aircraft modification business of $4.8 million and an increase in our avionics business of $6.1 million. We have invested in the development of several STCs. These STCs are state of the art avionics and we are aggressively marketing both domestically and internationally.\n\u25cf\nCosts increased 33% to $22.9 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $17.2 million in fiscal 2019. Costs were 61% of segment total revenue in fiscal 2020, compared to 65% of segment total revenue in fiscal 2019.\n\u25cf\nExpenses increased 35% in fiscal 2020 to $7.7 million compared to $5.7 million in fiscal 2019.

However, we continue to maintain contact with other banks that have an interest in funding our working capital needs to continue our growth in operations in 2020 and beyond.\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, Butler National Service Corporation continues friendly discussions with the other member of BHCMC, LLC to explore the possible acquisition by Butler National Service Corporation of the other member's 20% equity interest in BHCMC, LLC. If and when a definitive agreement is reached, such definitive agreement and a press release concerning the acquisition will be issued to describe the terms of the agreement and the intentions of the members.

Inventories increased our cash position by $270. Accounts payable and customer deposits decreased our cash position by $1.6 million. Prepaid expenses and other assets and income tax receivable increased our cash by $53, while gaming facility mandated payments increased our cash by an additional $58.

We invested $786 to purchase aircraft, $1.1 million towards STCs, and $1.3 million on equipment and furnishings. We received $1.1 million in proceeds for the sale of airplanes.\nCash used in financing activities was $195. We increased our debt by $1.5 million. We reduced our finance lease liability by $1.0 million. We distributed $360 to our non-controlling member and purchased company stock of $326. The stock acquired was placed in treasury.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates:\nWe believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving management judgments and estimates. These significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, the use of estimates, long-lived assets, and Supplemental Type Certificates. These policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within this \"Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" In addition, Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements expands upon discussion of our accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition: Revenue Recognition: ASC Topic 606, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d\nUnder ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services. To achieve this core principal, the Company applies the following five steps:\n1)\nIdentify the contract, or contracts, with a customer\nA contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party\u2019s rights regarding the services to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to these services, (ii) the contract has commercial substance and (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially all consideration for services that are transferred is probable based on the customer\u2019s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration.\n2)\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract\nAt contract inception, an entity shall assess the goods or services promised in a contract with a customer and shall identify as a performance obligation each promise to transfer to the customer. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised services, the Company must apply judgment to determine whether promised services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met the promised services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\n3)\nDetermination of the transaction price\nThe transaction price is the amount that an entity allocates to the performance obligations identified in the contract and, therefore, represents the amount of revenue recognized as those performance obligations are satisfied. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer.\n4)\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nOnce a contract and associated performance obligations have been identified and the transaction price has been determined, ASC 606 requires an entity to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified. This is generally done in proportion to the standalone selling prices of each performance obligation (i.e., on a relative standalone selling price basis). As a result, any discount within the contract generally is allocated proportionally to all the separate performance obligations in the contract. The Company is applying the right to invoice practical expedient to recognize revenue. As a result, the entity bypasses the steps of determining the transaction price, allocating that transaction price and determining when to recognize revenue as it will recognize revenue as billed by multiplying the price assigned to the good or service, by the units.\n5)\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation\nRevenue is recognized when or as performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. Control transfers either over time or at a point in time. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nAircraft modifications are performed under fixed-price contracts. Revenue from fixed-priced contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the direct labor incurred compared to total estimated direct labor.\nRevenue from Avionics products are recognized when shipped. Payment for these Avionics products is due within 30 days of the invoice date after shipment. Revenue from Gaming Management and other Corporate/Professional Services is recognized as the service is rendered.\nRegarding warranties and returns, our products are special order and are not suitable for return. Our products are unique upon installation and tested prior to their release to the customer and acceptance by the customer. In the rare event of a warranty claim, the claim is processed through the normal course of business and may include additional charges to the customer. In our opinion, any future warranty work would not be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nGaming revenue is the gross gaming win as reported by the Kansas Lottery casino reporting systems, less the mandated payments by and for the State of Kansas. Electronic games-slots and table games revenue is the aggregate of gaming wins and losses. Liabilities are recognized for chips and \"ticket-in, ticket-out\" coupons in the customers' possession, and for accruals related to anticipated payout of progressive jackpots. Progressive gaming machines, which contain base jackpots that increase at a progressive rate based on the number of coins played, are deducted from revenue as the value of jackpots increase. Food, beverage, and other revenue is recorded when the service is received and paid.\nUse of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Significant estimates include assumptions about collection of accounts receivable, the valuation, and recognition of stock-based compensation expense, valuation for deferred tax assets and useful life of fixed assets.\nLong-lived Assets: The Company accounts for its long-lived assets in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10, \"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\" ASC Topic 360-10 requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The Company assesses recoverability of the carrying value of an asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset's carrying value and fair value or disposable value.\nSupplemental Type Certificates: Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs) are authorizations granted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for specific modification of a certain aircraft. The STC authorizes us to perform modifications, installations, and assemblies on applicable customer-owned aircraft. Costs incurred to obtain STCs are capitalized and subsequently amortized over a seven year life. The legal life of an STC is indefinite.\nChanging Prices and Inflation\nWe have experienced upward pressure from inflation in fiscal year 2020. From fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020 a majority of the increases we experienced were in material costs. This additional cost may not be transferable to our customers resulting in lower income in the future. We anticipate labor rates, fuel costs and possibly interest rates to rise in fiscal years 2021 and 2022.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nNot applicable.",

    "item_9A": "Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nWe maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Our principal executive and financial officers have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-K and have determined that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective, based on criteria in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\").\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures: Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nIn connection with the preparation of this Form 10-K, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of April 30, 2020. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of April 30, 2020.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by (\"COSO\"). Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of April 30, 2020.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of Company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting because it is not required for a smaller reporting company.\nLimitations on Controls\nOur management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: In our opinion, there were no material changes in the Company internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended April 30, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal controls over financial reporting.",

Edgar\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the board of directors of\nButler National Corporation and Subsidiaries\nOlathe, Kansas\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Butler National Corporation and Subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of April 30, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended April 30, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended April 30, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nChange in Accounting Principles\nAs discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as amended, effective May 1, 2019.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ RBSM LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2015.\nNew York, NY\nJuly 17, 2020\nBUTLER NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAS OF April 30, 2020 and 2019\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements\nBUTLER NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED April 30, 2020 and 2019\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements\nBUTLER NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED April 30, 2020 and 2019\n(dollars in thousands)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nBUTLER NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED April 30, 2020 and 2019\n(dollars in thousands)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nBUTLER NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n1.\nNATURE OF OPERATIONS, ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Butler National Corporation (BNC) and its wholly-owned active subsidiaries, Avcon Industries, Inc., BCS Design, Inc., Butler National Service Corporation, Butler National Corporation-Tempe, Butler Avionics, Inc., Butler National, Inc., Butler Temporary Services, Inc., Kansas International Corporation, Kansas International DDC, LLC, and a majority owned subsidiary, BHCMC, LLC (collectively, The Company). These consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), expressed in U.S. dollars. All amounts are in thousands, except share and par values, unless otherwise noted. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The fiscal year end of the Company is April 30.\nAvcon Industries, Inc. modifies business category aircraft at its Newton, Kansas facility. Modifications can include passenger-to-freighter configuration, addition of aerial photography capability, ISR modifications, and stability enhancing modifications. Butler Avionics, Inc. sells, installs and repairs avionics equipment (airplane radio equipment and flight control systems). Butler National, Inc. acquires airplanes, principally Learjets, to refurbish and sell. Butler Temporary Services, Inc. processes company payroll. Kansas International Corporation and Kansas International DDC, LLC own property. Butler National Corporation-Tempe is primarily engaged in the manufacture electronic upgrades for classic weapon control systems used by the military. Butler National Service Corporation is a management consulting and administrative services firm providing business planning and financial coordination to Indian tribes interested in owning and operating casinos under the terms of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. BHCMC, LLC is majority-owned and provides management services for the Boot Hill Casino under a management agreement with the State of Kansas. BCS Design, Inc. provides professional architectural services.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:\na)\nAccounts receivable: Accounts receivable are carried on a gross basis, with no discounting, less the allowance for doubtful accounts. Management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on existing economic conditions, the financial conditions of the customers, and the amount and the age of past due accounts. Receivables are considered past due if full payment is not received by the contractual due date. Past due accounts are generally written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts only after all collection attempts have been exhausted. Allowance for doubtful accounts are calculated on the historical write-off of doubtful accounts of the individual subsidiaries. Invoices are generally considered a doubtful account if no payment has been made in the past 90 days. We review these policies on a quarterly basis, and based on these reviews, we believe we maintain adequate reserves. At April 30, 2020 and 2019, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $143 and $143, respectively.\nb)\nUse of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. Significant estimates include assumptions about collection of accounts receivable, the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation expense, valuation for deferred tax assets and useful life of fixed assets.\nc)\nInventories: Inventories are priced at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventories include material, labor and factory overhead required in the production of our products.\nInventory obsolescence is examined on a regular basis. When determining our estimate of obsolescence, we consider inventory that has been inactive for five years or longer and the probability of using that inventory in future production. The obsolete inventory generally consists of Falcon and Learjet parts and electrical components. At April 30, 2020 and 2019, the estimate of obsolete inventory was $685 and $718 respectively.\nd)\nProperty and Related Depreciation: Machinery and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis. The lives used for the significant items within each property classification range from 3 to 39 years.\nMaintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of assets retired are removed from the accounts and any resulting gains or losses are reflected as income or expense.\ne)\nLong-Lived Assets: The Company accounts for its long-lived assets in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10, \"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\" ASC Topic 360-10 requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The Company assesses recoverability of the carrying value of an asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset's carrying value and fair value or disposable value.\nf)\nOther Assets: Our other asset account includes assets of $5,500 related to the Kansas Expanded Lottery Act Management Contract privilege fee, $5,868 of gaming equipment we were required to pay for ownership by the State of Kansas Lottery, and JET autopilot intellectual property of $1,417, and miscellaneous other assets of $914. BHCMC expects the $5,500 privilege fee to have a value over the remaining life of the initial Management Contract with the State of Kansas which will end in December 2024. The State of Kansas approved a renewal management contract and an amendment to the current management contract for our professional services company BNSC via BHCMC. The renewal will take effect December 15, 2024, and continue until 2039, another 15 years. The Managers Certificate asset for use of gaming equipment is being amortized over a period of three years based on the estimated useful life of gaming equipment. The JET intellectual property is being amortized over a period of fifteen years.\nOther assets net values are as follows:\ng)\nSupplemental Type Certificates: Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs) are authorizations granted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for specific modification of a certain aircraft. The STC authorizes us to perform modifications, installations, and assemblies on applicable customer-owned aircraft. Costs incurred to obtain STCs are capitalized and subsequently amortized over seven years. The legal life of an STC is indefinite. We believe we have enough future sales to fully amortize our STC development costs. Consultant costs, as shown below, include costs of engineering, legal and aircraft specialists. STC capitalized costs are as follows:\nh)\nRevenue Recognition: ASC Topic 606, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d\nUnder ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services. To achieve this core principal, the Company applies the following five steps:\n1) Identify the contract, or contracts, with a customer\nA contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party\u2019s rights regarding the services to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to these services, (ii) the contract has commercial substance and (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially all consideration for services that are transferred is probable based on the customer\u2019s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration.\n2) Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\nAt contract inception, an entity shall assess the goods or services promised in a contract with a customer and shall identify as a performance obligation each promise to transfer to the customer. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised services, the Company must apply judgment to determine whether promised services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met the promised services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\n3) Determination of the transaction price\nThe transaction price is the amount that an entity allocates to the performance obligations identified in the contract and, therefore, represents the amount of revenue recognized as those performance obligations are satisfied. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer.\n4) Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nOnce a contract and associated performance obligations have been identified and the transaction price has been determined, ASC 606 requires an entity to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified. This is generally done in proportion to the standalone selling prices of each performance obligation (i.e., on a relative standalone selling price basis). As a result, any discount within the contract generally is allocated proportionally to all the separate performance obligations in the contract. The Company is applying the right to invoice practical expedient to recognize revenue. As a result, the entity bypasses the steps of determining the transaction price, allocating that transaction price and determining when to recognize revenue as it will recognize revenue as billed by multiplying the price assigned to the good or service, by the units.\n5) Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation\nRevenue is recognized when or as performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. Control transfers either over time or at a point in time. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nAircraft modifications are performed under fixed-price contracts. Revenue from fixed-priced contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the direct labor incurred compared to total estimated direct labor.\nRevenue from Avionics products are recognized when shipped. Payment for these Avionics products is due within 30 days of the invoice date after shipment. Revenue from Gaming Management and other Corporate/Professional Services is recognized as the service is rendered.\nRegarding warranties and returns, our products are special order and are not suitable for return. Our products are unique upon installation and tested prior to their release to the customer and acceptance by the customer. In the rare event of a warranty claim, the claim is processed through the normal course of business and may include additional charges to the customer. In our opinion, any future warranty work would not be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nGaming revenue is the gross gaming win as reported by the Kansas Lottery casino reporting systems, less the mandated payments by and for the State of Kansas. Electronic games-slots and table games revenue is the aggregate of gaming wins and losses. Liabilities are recognized for chips and \"ticket-in, ticket-out\" coupons in the customers' possession, and for accruals related to anticipated payout of progressive jackpots. Progressive gaming machines, which contain base jackpots that increase at a progressive rate based on the number of coins played, are deducted from revenue as the value of jackpots increase. Food, beverage, and other revenue is recorded when the service is received and paid.\ni)\nSlot Machine Jackpots: If the casino is not required to make payment of the jackpot (i.e. the incremental amount on a progressive machine) due to legal requirements, the jackpot is accrued as the obligation becomes unavoidable. This liability is accrued over the time period in which the incremental progressive jackpot amount is generated with a related reduction in casino revenue. No liability is accrued with respect to the base jackpot.\nj)\nAdvanced Payments and Billings in Excess of Costs Incurred: We receive advances, performance-based payments and progress payment from customers which may exceed costs incurred on certain contracts. We classify advance payments and billings in excess of costs incurred, other than those reflected as a reduction of contracts in process, as customer deposits in current liabilities.\nk)\nEarnings Per Share: Earnings per common share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.\nThe computation of the Company basic and diluted earnings per common share is as follows:\nl)\nStock-based Compensation: The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under ASC Topic 505-50, \"Share-Based Payment\" ASC 718, \"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.\" These standards define a fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation. The cost of stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the vesting period. The value of the stock-based award is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, whereby compensation cost is the excess of the fair value of the award as determined by the pricing model at the grant date or other measurement date over the amount that must be paid to acquire the stock. The resulting amount is charged to expense on the straight-line basis over the period in which the Company expects to receive the benefit, which is generally the vesting period.\nm)\nIncome Taxes: The Company utilizes ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. Amounts provided for income tax expense are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable under tax laws. Deferred taxes, which arise principally from temporary differences between the period in which certain income and expense items are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the period in which they affect taxable income, are included in the amounts provided for income taxes. Under this method, the computation of deferred tax assets and liabilities give recognition to enacted tax rates in effect in the year the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect to realize.\nn)\nCash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash and investments in a money market fund. We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash in bank deposit accounts that, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. At April 30, 2020 and 2019, we had $12,509 and $5,365, respectively in bank deposits that exceeded the federally insured limits.\no)\nConcentration of Credit Risk: We extend credit to customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and collateral is not required. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts.\np)\nResearch and Development: We invested in research and development activities. The amount invested in the year ended April 30, 2020 and 2019 was $2,404 and $1,888 respectively.\nq)\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements:\nOn May 1, 2019 the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) using the modified retrospective optional transition method. Thus, the standard was applied starting May 1, 2019 and prior periods were not restated. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. See Note 3 for additional information.\nThere were other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nr)\nReclassifications: Certain reclassifications within the financial statement captions have been made to maintain consistency in presentation between years. These reclassifications have no impact on the reported results of operations.\n2.\nDEBT:\nPrincipal amounts of debt at April 30, 2020 and 2019, consist of the following (in thousands):\nMaturities of long-term debt are as follows:\n3.\nFINANCED LEASE RIGHT-TO-USE:\nOn May 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02 Leases - Topic 842. ASU 2016-02 requires that on the balance sheet a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.\nWe lease the casino as well as hangar and office space with initial lease terms of two, five, twenty-five and fifty years.\nFuture minimum lease payments for assets under capital leases at April 30, 2020 are as follows:\nThe adoption of ASU 2016-02 had a negative impact on our financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2020. The impact is summarized below.\nFinancial and Other Covenants\nWe are in compliance with our covenants at April 30, 2020.\n4.\nINCOME TAXES:\nDeferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provision of the enacted tax laws. Significant components of the Company's deferred tax liabilities and assets as of April 30, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (in thousands):\nThe reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate is as follows:\nCurrent income tax expense of $1,594 and $297 are comprised of $1,151 and $170 in federal income tax and $443 and $127 in state income tax for the years ended April 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cashflow. Therefore, no reserve for uncertain income tax position, interest or penalties, have been recorded.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal tax examinations for tax years beginning on May 1, 2015 and prior. There are no current tax examinations.\n5.\nSTOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:\nCommon Stock Transactions\nDuring the year ended April 30, 2020, we issued 1,711,555 shares valued at $676 as the contribution to the Company 401(k) profit sharing plan.\nDuring the year ended April 30, 2019, we issued 2,311,268 shares valued at $584 as the contribution to the Company 401(k) profit sharing plan.\n6.\nSTOCK OPTIONS AND INCENTIVE PLANS\nIn November 2016, the shareholders approved and adopted the Butler National Corporation 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the Plan is 12.5 million.\nOn April 12, 2019, the Company granted 2.5 million restricted shares to employees.

We are currently not a party to any material legal proceedings or government actions, including any bankruptcy, receivership, or similar proceedings. In addition, we are not aware of any known litigation or liabilities involving the operators of our properties that could affect our operations. Furthermore, as of July 17, 2020, our management is not aware of any proceedings to which any of our directors, officers, or affiliates, or any associate of any such director, officer, affiliate, or security holder is a party averse to our company or has a material interest averse to us.\n9.\nRELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS:\nWe paid consulting fees of $135 and $135 to David Hayden, a director of Butler National Corporation in fiscal year ended April 30, 2020 and 2019 respectively.\nIncluded in accrued liabilities are $748 and $623 as of April 30, 2020 and 2019 respectively for amounts owed to our CEO for accrued compensation.\nIncluded in other assets at April 30, 2020 and 2019 is $780 owed to us by the noncontrolling company of BHCMC, LLC for costs incurred on their behalf.\nIn fiscal 2020, there were three related-person transactions under the relevant standards: Butler National employed the brother (Wayne Stewart), son (Craig Stewart) and son-in-law (Jeff Shinkle) of Clark D. Stewart, an executive officer, as an engineer, Vice President, and an architect. Compensation for these related-persons was calculated in the same manner as the Summary Compensation table shown in the most recent Proxy Statement resulting in compensation of $533, $743 and $282, respectively, for fiscal 2020 and $370, $475 and $237, respectively, for fiscal 2019.\nThe policies and procedures for payment of goods and services for related transactions follow our normal course of business standards and require the necessary review and approval process as outlined in our Policies and Procedures manual and as set forth by our Compensation Committee.\n10.\n401(k) PROFIT SHARING PLAN:\nWe have a defined contribution plan authorized under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. All benefits-eligible employees with at least thirty days of service are eligible to participate in the plan; however, there are only two entry dates per calendar year. The Plan may match subject to the annual approval of the Board of Directors, 100 percent of every pre-tax dollar an employee contributes up to 6 percent of the employee's salary, and a portion of the Company\u2019s profits. Employees are 100 percent vested in the employer's contributions immediately. Our matching contribution, as approved by the Board of Directors was paid in common stock of the Company. The contribution amount was valued at the market price of the stock contributed in 2020 and 2019 was approximately $676 and $584 respectively.\n11.\nREFUND OF SALES/USE TAX:\nOn December 29, 2017, BHCMC, received a ruling from the Kansas Supreme Court in the Matter of the Appeal of BHCMC, LLC d/b/a Boot Hill Casino & Resort, concerning the request for refund for sales/use taxes paid for slot machines owned by the Kansas Lottery. The Kansas Department of Revenue appealed from a Board of Tax Appeals summary decision granting a compensating use tax refund to BHCMC. The Kansas Supreme Court addressed \u201cwhether such a tax can be imposed on Boot Hill (BHCMC) for electronic gaming machines it does not-and, under the law and its management agreement with Kansas Lottery, cannot-own\u201d. The Court ruled that \u201cBoot Hill did not exercise a right or power incident to ownership of personal property in order to be subject to a compensating use tax for that property.\u201d Because BHCMC has not exercised such a power or right, the Court affirmed Board of Tax Appeals' refund decision and the ruling of the Kansas Court of Appeals panel decision. Management makes no assurances related to collection of, or the timeliness of, any actions realizing any direct monetary effects, if any, of the ruling. Therefore, the Company accounted for these sales tax refunds as other income when payment was received from the State of Kansas. The amount of refunds received from the State in 2020 and 2019 amounted to $0 and $1,995, respectively. No additional claim or refunds is anticipated.\n12.\nINDUSTRY SEGMENTATION AND SALES BY MAJOR CUSTOMER:\nIndustry Segmentation\nCurrent Activities - The Company focuses on two primary activities, Professional Services and Aerospace Products.\nAerospace Products:\nAircraft Modifications principally includes the modification of customer and company owned business-size aircraft from passenger to freighter configuration, radar systems, addition of aerial photography capabilities, ISR modifications, and stability enhancing modifications for Learjet, Beechcraft, Cessna, and Dassault Falcon aircraft along with other specialized modifications. We provide these services through our subsidiary, Avcon Industries, Inc. (\"Aircraft Modifications\" or \"Avcon\").\nAvionics principally includes the manufacture, sale, and service of electronics upgrades for classic weapon control systems used on military aircraft and vehicles. We provide the products through our subsidiary, Butler National Corporation - Tempe, Arizona (\"Avionics\").\nButler Avionics sells, installs and repairs avionics equipment (airplane radio equipment and flight control systems). These systems are flight display systems which include intuitive touchscreen controls with large display to give users unprecedented access to high-resolution terrain mapping, graphical flight planning, geo-referenced charting, traffic display, satellite weather and much more. Butler Avionics is also recognized nationwide for its troubleshooting and repair work particularly on autopilot systems.\nProfessional Services:\nButler National Service Corporation (\"BNSC\") provides management services to the Boot Hill Casino, a \"state-owned casino\".\nBCS Design, Inc. provides licensed architectural services.

The top customer provided 21.2% of total revenue while the next top four customers ranged from 1.3% to 11.4%.\n13.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS:\nThe Company adopted ASC Topic 820-10 at the beginning of 2009 to measure the fair value of certain of its financial assets required to be measured on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). ASC Topic 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820-10 are described below:\nLevel 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an entity has the ability to access.\nLevel 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are supportable by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of April 30, 2020 (in thousands):\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of April 30, 2019 (in thousands):\n14.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS:\nIn April, 2020, the Company received two Paycheck Protection Program loans relating to the aerospace segment totaling $1,283.

The Boot Hill Casino and Resort was forced to close for approximately two months. The proceeds of this loan were used to continue paying employees of the casino.\nThe Company evaluated its April 30, 2020 consolidated financial statements for subsequent events through July 17, 2020, the filing date of this report. The Company is not aware of any other subsequent events that would require recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements."
