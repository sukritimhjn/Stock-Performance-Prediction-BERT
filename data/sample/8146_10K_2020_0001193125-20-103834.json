    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nGeneral\nUnless otherwise indicated, references to \u201cAstroNova,\u201d the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to AstroNova, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nAstroNova designs, develops, manufactures and distributes a broad range of specialty printers and data acquisition and analysis systems, including both hardware and software, which incorporate advanced technologies to acquire, store, analyze, and present data in multiple formats. Target markets for hardware and software products of the Company include aerospace, apparel, automotive, avionics, chemicals, computer peripherals, communications, distribution, food and beverage, general manufacturing, packaging and transportation.\nThe Company\u2019s products are distributed around the world through its own sales force, authorized dealers and through independent dealers and representatives.\nOur business consists of two segments, Product Identification (\u201cPI\u201d) and Test & Measurement (\u201cT&M\u201d). The PI segment includes specialty printing systems and related supplies sold under the brand names QuickLabel\u00ae, TrojanLabel\u00ae and GetLabels\u2122. The T&M segment includes the Company\u2019s line of aerospace flight deck printers and test and measurement data acquisition systems sold under the AstroNova\u00ae brand name. Refer to Note 15, \u201cNature of Operations, Segment Reporting and Geographical Information,\u201d in our audited consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for financial information regarding the Company\u2019s segments.\nThe following description of our business should be read in conjunction with \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\u201d on pages 21 through 33 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDescription of Business\nProduct Overview\nAstroNova leverages its expertise in data visualization technologies to design, manufacture and market specialty printing systems, test and measurement systems and related services for select growing markets on a global basis.\nProduct Identification products sold under the QuickLabel, TrojanLabel and GetLabels brands are used in brand owner and commercial applications to provide product packaging, marketing, tracking, branding and labeling solutions to a wide array of industries. The PI segment offers a variety of digital color label tabletop printers, high-volume presses and specialty OEM printing systems, as well as a wide range of label, tag and flexible packaging material substrates and other supplies, including ink and toner, that allow customers to mark, track, protect and enhance the appearance of their products. In the T&M segment, the Company has a long history of using its technologies to provide networking systems and high-resolution light-weight flight deck and cabin printers for the aerospace market. In addition, the T&M segment includes data acquisition recorders, sold under the AstroNova brand, to enable our customers to acquire and record visual and electronic signal data from local and networked data streams and sensors. The recorded data is processed and analyzed and then stored and presented in various visual output formats.\nProduct Identification\nAstroNova\u2019s PI segment includes three brands: QuickLabel, TrojanLabel, and GetLabels. Printers and supplies are sold to brand owners, manufacturers and retailers who label or mark products on a short to mid-size run basis. AstroNova PI customers benefit from the efficiency, flexibility and cost-savings of digitally printing labels in their facility, on-demand, with the ability to accommodate multiple SKUs or variable data such as bar codes, lot numbers or expiration dates. QuickLabel brand products include tabletop printers, production-ready digital color label printers and specialty OEM printing systems for either standalone output or inline integration with existing pre-processing and finishing systems. Customers use the Company\u2019s digital label printer products in a wide variety of industries, including chemical, cosmetics, food and beverage, medical products, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, and many others. TrojanLabel expands the Company\u2019s customer market by providing a range of higher volume digital color printers, OEM printing systems and supplies that target the more demanding needs of commercial printers, label converters and packaging manufacturers, giving them the ability to digitally mark or encode products directly or to produce labels for post printing applications. GetLabels brand products include a full line of media supplies, including label materials, tags, inks, toners and thermal transfer ribbons designed for optimal performance with the Company\u2019s printing hardware. In addition, GetLabels media is compatible with a wide variety of competitive and third-party printing hardware.\nCurrent QuickLabel models include a selection of professional tabletop digital color label printers. The high-speed QL-120X was built on AstroNova\u2019s pioneering and successful Kiaro! platform. Introduced early in 2019, the high-performance QL-300 was the first 5-color toner-based electrophotographic tabletop production label printer in the market. In addition, our QuickLabel line of printers includes the QL-850, our next-generation wide-format inkjet color label printer, the QL-30 and QL-60 series, a family of high-end monochrome printers, and the QLS-4100 XE, a unique solution with the ability to digitally print full color labels and tags using thermal transfer ribbon technology.\nOur TrojanLabel portfolio includes a range of products from professional digital color label mini-presses to large-scale all-in-one inline specialty printing systems. The T2-C, a compact, digital mini-press designed for 24/7 label production, includes numerous differentiating features for several end-use market applications. The T2-L is a narrow format digital press designed specifically for flexible packaging substrates. Beyond label printing, the T3-OPX, introduced in late 2019, allows printing directly onto a range of flat products, including cardboard, paper bags, flat wood planks and many other items using pigment inks that are water-resistant and highly resistant to UV exposure. A professional label press and finishing system, the T4, enables print, die-cut, and lamination in an all-in-one machine with a much smaller footprint than others in the market. Expanding on the T4 with additional features, the T5 incorporates capabilities of a compact converter unit featuring UV varnish, lamination, rotary die-cutting, slitting and waste removal to offer an all-in-one digital print and finish inline labeling solution.\nGetLabels provides a broad range of high-quality supplies for both AstroNova printers and third-party printers. Supplies include label and tag materials, inks, toner and thermal transfer material. Label materials and\nsubstrates are specifically designed and constructed for a wide variety of labeling applications. Each label material and substrate is qualified and tested in our on-site Materials Research Laboratory to ensure durability and compatibility with our QuickLabel and TrojanLabel branded products, along with a variety of third-party printers.\nThe PI segment additionally develops and licenses various specialized software used to design and manage labels and print images, as well as manage and operate our printers and presses and coordinate printing on an automated basis directly over networked systems. PI also provides worldwide training and support.\nT&M\nProducts sold under AstroNova\u2019s T&M segment are designed and manufactured for airborne printing solutions and for data acquisition. AstroNova\u2019s aerospace applications include flight deck printing solutions, networking hardware and thermal paper. The Company\u2019s data acquisition systems are used in research and development, flight testing, missile/rocket telemetry production monitoring and maintenance applications. These products are sold to customers in a variety of industries, including aerospace & defense, automotive, commercial airline, energy, manufacturing and transportation, to meet the need to acquire and record data from local and networked data streams and sensors.\nAirborne printers include the Company\u2019s flagship ToughWriter\u00ae series used in the flight decks and cabins of military, commercial and business aircraft to print hard copies of data required for the safe and efficient operation of aircraft, including navigation maps, arrival and departure information, flight itineraries, weather maps, performance data, passenger data, and various air traffic control data. ToughSwitch\u00ae Ethernet switches are used primarily in military aircraft and military vehicles to connect multiple computers or Ethernet devices. The airborne printers and Ethernet switches are ruggedized to comply with rigorous military and commercial flight worthiness standards for operation under extreme environmental conditions. The Company is currently furnishing ToughWriter airborne printers for many aircraft made by Airbus, Boeing, Embraer, Bombardier, Lockheed, Gulfstream and others. In addition to the ToughWriter products, the Company manufactures other flight deck printers, including Miltope-brand and RITEC-brand airborne printers that the Company acquired in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the PTA-45 cockpit printer. The PTA-45B is subject to the Asset Purchase and Licenses Agreement with Honeywell International, Inc. (the \u201cHoneywell Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which in 2017 the Company acquired an exclusive perpetual world-wide license to manufacture and support Honeywell\u2019s narrow-format flight deck printers for the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320 aircraft. Over time we expect that customers will chose to replace those printers with ToughWriter products because they have numerous technical features and functional advantages and significant weight savings.\nOther T&M products include: the TMX\u00ae all-in-one high speed data acquisition system for applications requiring high channel counts and acquisition rates, the Daxus\u00ae DXS-100 distributed data acquisition platform, the SmartCorder\u00ae DDX-100, a portable all-in-one data acquisition system for facilities maintenance and field testing and the Everest\u00ae EV-5000 digital strip chart recording system used mainly in telemetry applications. The Daxus DXS-100 can be connected to the SmartCorder to increase channel count or networked as part of a distributed measurement system spanning vast distances.\nTechnology\nOur core technologies are data visualization technologies that relate to (1) acquiring data, (2) conditioning the data, (3) displaying or printing the data on hard copy, monitor or electronic storage media and (4) analyzing the data. To service data visualization, AstroNova maintains technological core competencies and trade know-how concerning the subject matter peculiar to each business unit. The technological disciplines are diverse and contain aspects of electronic, software, mechanical and industrial engineering. Additionally, AstroNova possesses engineering expertise in the areas of digital signal processing, image processing, fluidics, color theory, high-speed material handling and design for airworthiness.\nPatents and Copyrights\nWe hold several product patents in the United States and in foreign countries. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions to protect our\ntechnology and brand name. We consider our intellectual property to be important to the operation of our business. In particular, we believe that the loss of the trademarks QuickLabel, TrojanLabel, ToughWriter or ToughSwitch or the loss of the license provided under the Honeywell Agreement could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business taken as a whole.\nManufacturing and Supplies\nWe manufacture many of the products that we design and sell. Raw materials and supplies are typically available from a wide variety of sources. We manufacture many of the sub-assemblies and parts in-house, including certain specialty printed circuit board assemblies and harnesses, and we have extensive electronic and mechanical final assembly and test operations. Many parts not manufactured in-house are standard electronic items available from multiple sources. Other printers and parts are designed or modified by us and manufactured by outside vendors according to our specifications. We purchase certain components, assembled products and supplies used in the manufacture of our products from a single source or limited supplier source. While we believe the majority of these sole or limited source components, assembled products and supplies could be sourced elsewhere with appropriate changes in the design of our products, such design might not be feasible on a timely basis, and any interruption in these components, products or supplies could adversely affect our business. When circumstances cause us to anticipate that the Company may not be able to acquire such components, products or supplies on a timely basis, the Company\u2019s practice is to procure a sufficient quantity in advance. In the past we have made such advance purchases primarily for aerospace products and in quantities that we anticipate will suffice for the life of the aircraft program for which those printers are designed.\nMarketing and Competition\nThe Company competes worldwide in multiple markets. In the specialty printing field, we believe we are a market leader in tabletop digital color label printing technology, a market leader in flight deck printers, and an innovator in digital color mini-press systems. In the data acquisition area, we are one of the leaders in general-purpose portable, high-speed data acquisition systems.\nOur management believes that we have a market leadership position in many of the markets we serve. We retain our leadership position by virtue of proprietary technology, product reputation, delivery, our channels to market, technical assistance and service to customers. The number of competitors varies by product line. Key competitive factors vary among our product lines, but include technology, quality, service and support, distribution network and breadth of product and service offerings.\nOur products are sold by direct field salespersons as well as independent dealers and representatives. In the United States, the Company has factory-trained direct field salespeople located in major cities from coast to coast specializing in either Product Identification or Test & Measurement products. We also have direct field sales or service centers in Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, and the United Kingdom staffed by our own employees and dedicated third party contractors. Additionally, we utilize over 225 independent dealers and representatives selling and marketing our products in over 60 countries.\nNo single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue in any of the last three fiscal years.\nOrder Backlog\nOur backlog varies regularly. It consists of a blend of orders for end-user customers as well as original equipment manufacturer customers. Manufacturing production is designed to meet forecasted demands and customer requirements. Accordingly, the amount of order backlog may not indicate future sales trends. Backlog at January 31, 2020 and 2019 was $25.2 million and $25.6 million, respectively.\nEmployees\nAs of January 31, 2020, we employed 365 people. We are generally able to satisfy our employment requirements. No employees are represented by a union. We believe that our employee relations are good.\nOther Information\nThe Company\u2019s business is not seasonal in nature. However, our revenue is impacted by the size of certain individual transactions, which can cause fluctuations in revenue from quarter to quarter.\nAvailable Information\nWe make available on our website (www.astronovainc.com) the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filing are also accessible on the SEC\u2019s website at http://www.sec.gov.",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating AstroNova, because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by the widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus known as COVID-19. COVID-19 has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a \u201cpandemic\u201d and has spread to many of the countries in which we, our customers, our suppliers and our other business partners do business. National, state and local governments in affected regions have implemented and may continue to implement safety precautions, including quarantines, travel restrictions, business closures, cancellations of public gatherings and other measures. Other organizations and individuals are taking additional steps to avoid or reduce infection, including limiting travel and staying home from work. These measures are disrupting normal business operations both in and outside of affected areas and have had significant negative impacts on businesses and financial markets worldwide.\nWe continue to monitor our operations and government recommendations and have made modifications to our normal operations because of the COVID-19 outbreak, including requiring most non-production related team members to work remotely. We have maintained a substantial portion of our manufacturing operational capacity at our manufacturing facilities located in West Warwick, Rhode Island, as well as our manufacturing facilities in Canada and Germany, at this time, and we have instituted heightened cleaning and sanitization standards and several health and safety protocols and procedures to safeguard our team members.\nHowever, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused the Company to experience a number of adverse impacts, including reductions in demand for its products, delays and cancellations of orders for its products, difficulties in obtaining raw materials and components for its products, shortages of labor to manufacture products, inefficiencies caused by remote worker\u2019s difficulties in performing their normal work outputs, closures of the facilities of some of its suppliers and customers, and delays in collecting accounts receivable.\nWhile it is not possible at this time to estimate the entirety of the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, customers, suppliers or other business partners, we expect that the continued spread of COVID-19, the measures taken by the governments of affected countries, actions taken to protect employees, and the impact of the pandemic on all business activities to further adversely impact our operational capacity and the efficiency of our team members and will materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions in the capital markets as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak may also adversely affect the Company if these impacts continue for a prolonged period and the Company needs additional liquidity.\nThe aerospace industry, which we serve through our aerospace product line, has been significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 outbreak, both inside and outside of the United States. The impact of the decline in air travel will likely have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results, the scope of which cannot be estimated at this time. Should one of more of our airplane OEM manufacturing customers or a significant number of airline customers fail to continue business as a going concern or declare bankruptcy, or otherwise reduce the demand for our products as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, it would have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial results.\nAstroNova\u2019s operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.\nAny decline in our customers\u2019 markets or in their general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products. For example, the current grounding and suspension of production of the Boeing 737 MAX has reduced demand for our airborne printers that are placed on that aircraft, as well as the related repairs and supplies, and that has negatively affected our results of operations. In addition, the current worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the airline industry as a whole, which could result in a reduction in orders by the airlines for new planes and reduce demand for retrofitting airplanes already in service and, therefore, a further reduction in demand for our airborne printer products. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and any future action relating to the 737 MAX on our business is currently unknown, but we expect any resulting changes in production schedules will likely have an adverse effect on our business, which could be material. Some of our customers may be reluctant to make capital equipment purchases or may defer certain of these purchases to future quarters. Some of our customers may also limit consumable product purchases to quantities necessary to satisfy immediate needs with no provisions to stock supplies for future use. Also, if our customers\u2019 markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our results of operations, financial position and cash flows and could limit our ability to continue to remain profitable.\nAstroNova\u2019s future revenue growth depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance of these new products and services.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and accelerating product introduction cycles. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and supplying high-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services on a timely basis and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. The success of our new products will also depend on our ability to differentiate our offerings from our competitors\u2019 offerings, price our products competitively, anticipate our competitors\u2019 development of new products, and maintain high levels of product quality and reliability. AstroNova spends a significant amount of time and effort related to the development of our airborne and color printer products as well as our data recorder products. Failure to meet our customers\u2019 changing business needs or to further develop any of our new products and their related markets as anticipated could adversely affect our future revenue growth and operating results.\nAs we introduce new or enhanced products, we must also successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers\u2019 ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. The introduction of new or enhanced products may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing existing products in anticipation of the new products. Additionally, when we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand, manage excess and obsolete inventories, address new or higher product cost structures, and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products. Any customer uncertainty regarding the timeline for rolling out new products or AstroNova\u2019s plans for future support of existing products may cause customers to delay purchase decisions or purchase competing products which would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAstroNova is dependent upon contract manufacturers for some of our products. If these manufacturers do not meet our requirements, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.\nWe subcontract the manufacturing and assembly of certain of our products to independent third parties at facilities located in various countries. Relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks, including:\n\u2022\nDisruptions in the global supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak;\n\u2022\nLimited control over the manufacturing process;\n\u2022\nPotential absence of adequate production capacity;\n\u2022\nPotential delays in production lead times;\n\u2022\nUnavailability of certain process technologies; and\n\u2022\nReduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs.\nIf one of our significant subcontractors becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture or provide these products in required volumes or fails to meet our quality standards, we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors or take over the manufacturing ourselves. Additional qualified subcontractors may not be available or may not be available on a timely or cost competitive basis. Any interruption in the supply or increase in the cost of the products manufactured by third party subcontractors or failure of a subcontractor to meet quality standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFor certain components, assembled products and supplies, AstroNova is dependent upon single or limited source suppliers. If these suppliers do not meet demand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed.\nAlthough we use standard parts and components for our products where possible, we purchase certain components, assembled products and supplies used in the manufacture of our products from a single source or limited supplier sources. If the supply of a key component, assembled products or certain supplies were to be delayed or curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or sole supplier delays shipment of such components or assembled products, our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected. For example, due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, there has been and likely will continue to be disruption to our supply chain due to the delays of component shipments from our vendors in China and other jurisdictions in which normal business operations are disrupted. Our business, results of operations and financial position could also be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Additionally, if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components, assembled products or supplies in required volumes, we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components. Alternative sources may not be available, or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis. Any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components, assembled products and supplies provided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAstroNova faces significant competition, and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in an environment of significant competition, especially in the markets in which we sell our PI printers and T&M data acquisition products. This competition is driven by rapid technological advances, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the demands of customers to become more efficient. Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. We compete based on technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we\ncurrently serve and to expand into additional market segments. Additionally, current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products or services with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully, our customers could seek alternative solutions from our competitors and we could lose market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\nAstroNova\u2019s profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to control our cost structure.\nOur success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to our shareholders. Depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. In addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are continually reviewing our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to reducing our labor cost-to-revenue ratio, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing certain internal functions. From time to time we also engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. If we are unable to maintain process and systems changes resulting from cost reduction and prior restructuring actions, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected.\nAstroNova\u2019s inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property, defend against assertions of infringement or lose certain licenses could prevent or restrict our ability to compete.\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, licenses, and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to the Company\u2019s proprietary technologies or design technologies around the intellectual property protections or licenses that the Company currently owns. The loss of the trademarks QuickLabel, TrojanLabel, ToughWriter and ToughSwitch or the loss of the licenses provided under the Honeywell Agreement could have a material adverse impact on our business taken as a whole. Operating outside the United States also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. The laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States. Any diminution in our ability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement, which could result in significant costs and divert our management\u2019s focus away from operations.\nAstroNova has significant inventories on hand.\nWe maintain a significant amount of inventory. Although we have provided an allowance for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, any significant unanticipated changes in future product demand or market conditions, including obsolescence or the uncertainty in the global market, as well as prolonged reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products due to the COVID-19 outbreak, could have an impact on the value of inventory and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect AstroNova\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Revenue from international operations, which includes both direct and indirect sales to customers\noutside the U.S., accounted for 37% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020, and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, we have employees, suppliers, contractors and facilities located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nInterruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;\n\u2022\nCustomer and vendor financial stability;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nChanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s environment including political, economic, monetary, regulatory or other conditions;\n\u2022\nTrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nNegative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u2022\nDifficulty in managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters;\n\u2022\nDifficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate staffing;\n\u2022\nDiffering labor regulations;\n\u2022\nDiffering protection of intellectual property;\n\u2022\nUnexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nGeopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war and public health disruptions, such as that caused by the current COVID-19 outbreak.\nBrexit\nThe U.K. formally left the E.U. on January 31, 2020 and has entered a transition period until December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the U.K. and the E.U. will seek to negotiate a trade deal, and the U.K. will remain in both the E.U. customs union and single market. The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. may also create further global economic uncertainty, which may adversely impact the economies of the U.K., the E.U. countries and other nations. Brexit could subject us to disruptions in trade and the free movement of goods, services and people to and from the UK, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the British pound and disruptions to our workforce and that of our suppliers and business partners.\nAstroNova could incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects.\nAstroNova has incurred and could incur additional liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. Our products may have defects despite our internal testing or testing by current or potential customers. These defects could result in among other things, a delay in recognition of sales, loss of sales, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance or substantial damage to our reputation. We could be subject to material claims by customers and may incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects.\nIn addition, through our acquisitions, we have assumed, and may in the future assume, liabilities related to products previously developed by an acquired company that have not been subjected to the same level of product development, testing and quality control processes we employ, and may have unknown or undetected errors. Some types of errors may not be detected until the product is installed in a user environment. This may cause\nAstroNova to incur significant warranty and repair or re-engineering costs and may divert the attention of engineering personnel from product development efforts which may cause significant customer relations problems such as reputational problems with customers resulting in increased costs and lower profitability.\nCertain of our products require certifications by customers, regulators or standards organizations, and our failure to obtain or maintain such certifications could negatively impact our business.\nIn certain industries and for certain products, such as those used in aircraft, we must obtain certifications for our products by customers, regulators or standards organizations. If we fail to obtain required certifications for our products, or if we fail to maintain such certifications on our products after they have been certified, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is based on the tax rates in effect where we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each jurisdiction. Our effective tax rate may vary as a result of numerous factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the results of examinations and audits of our tax filings, whether we secure or sustain acceptable arrangements with tax authorities, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws, including the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations.\nThe Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. federal corporate income tax law and includes a broad range of tax reform measures affecting business including among other things, the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the loss of certain business deductions, the acceleration of first-year expensing of certain capital expenditures and a one-time tax imposed on unremitted cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act is complex and far-reaching, and we continue to evaluate the actual impact of its enactment on the Company. Any material adverse impact resulting from the Tax Act that has not yet been identified could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nFurther changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which represents a coalition of member countries. On October 5, 2015, the OECD issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. Many of these recommendations or similar concepts are being adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries. Changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform, including future actions taken by foreign governments in response to the Tax Act, could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years.\nChanges to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the Tax Act), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, could have a material impact on our estimates of our effective tax rate and our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The impact of these factors may be substantially different from period-to-period.\nIn addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. Any further significant changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could adversely affect our financial statements.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could negatively impact our income tax expense, net income and cash flow.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment and estimation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities and to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax benefit or expense, net loss or income, and cash flows in the period in which such determination is made. As of January 31, 2020, we did not record any liabilities for uncertain tax positions.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amount for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. In some cases, we may record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. We review our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance requirements quarterly. If we are unable to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net carrying value of deferred tax assets, we will record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value, which could result in a material income tax charge. As part of our review, we consider positive and negative evidence, including cumulative results of recent years.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\nThe credit agreement governing our credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as amended, contains, and any future debt agreements may include, several restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nIncur future indebtedness;\n\u2022\nPlace liens on assets;\n\u2022\nPay dividends or distributions on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 capital stock;\n\u2022\nRepurchase or acquire our capital stock;\n\u2022\nConduct mergers or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nSell assets; and/or\n\u2022\nAlter our or our subsidiaries\u2019 capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness.\nOur credit agreement with Bank of America also requires us to satisfy other requirements, including maintaining certain financial ratios and condition tests. Our ability to meet these requirements can be affected by events beyond our control, and specifically because of the decline in revenue caused by the demand for aircraft cockpit printers for the 737 MAX, the anticipated decline in revenue due to the demand for aircraft due to the current COVID-19 pandemic driven decline in revenue passenger miles, as well as the likely decline in demand for some of our PI and other T&M products as a result of the COVID-19 driven slowdown in general economic activity. At this time, we expect that it is likely that we will violate the current terms of our credit agreement with Bank of America at the end of our first or second quarter of fiscal year 2021. While we expect to be able to renegotiate the terms of the credit agreement, if we are unable to do so or to secure alternative financing on acceptable terms, it will have a material adverse impact on us. To the extent we fail to meet any such requirements and are in default under our debt obligations, our financial condition may be materially adversely\naffected. These restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us. To the extent that we are unable to engage in activities that support the growth, profitability and competitiveness of our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the agreement governing our credit facility permits us to elect to pay interest on our revolving line of credit based on LIBOR or a base rate as specified in the agreement. We also have term loans under our credit facility, as well as derivative instruments with variable interest rates, that are indexed to LIBOR. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, the authority that regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the preferred alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR (\u201cUSD-LIBOR\u201d) for use in debt instruments, derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD-LIBOR, and organizations are currently working on an industry wide and/or company specific transition from LIBOR to an alternative that will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates or financing costs to borrowers. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United States or elsewhere. To the extent these changes cause the interest rates on our borrowings to increase, our interest expense will increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nAstroNova may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures and strategic partnerships, and integration of acquired companies or divestiture of businesses may negatively impact AstroNova\u2019s overall business.\nWe have made strategic investments in other companies, products and technologies. We may continue to identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets, such as customer bases, products and technology. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities. In any acquisition that we complete we cannot be certain that:\n\u2022\nWe will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own;\n\u2022\nAll the benefits expected from such integration will be realized;\n\u2022\nManagement\u2019s attention will not be diverted or divided, to the detriment of current operations;\n\u2022\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets or possible impairment of acquired intangibles will not have a negative impact on operating results or other aspects of our business;\n\u2022\nDelays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental impact on our business, operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022\nCustomer dissatisfaction with, or performance problems at, an acquired company will not have an adverse impact on our reputation; and\n\u2022\nRespective operations, management and personnel will be compatible.\nIn certain instances, as permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules, acquisitions may be consummated without seeking and obtaining shareholder approval, in which case shareholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in an acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks.\nWe may also divest certain businesses from time to time. Divestitures will likely involve risks, such as difficulty splitting up businesses, distracting employees, potential loss of revenue and negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customer relationships. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nEffectively transfer assets, liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;\n\u2022\nIdentify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and\n\u2022\nReduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.\nAll of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions.\nIf we are not able to successfully integrate or divest businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire or divest, or able to realize expected benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures or strategic partnerships, AstroNova\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAdverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets could impair our liquidity or interrupt our access to capital markets, borrowings or financial transactions to hedge certain risks.\nAt the end of fiscal 2020, we had approximately $4.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in a mix of money market funds, bank demand deposit accounts and foreign bank accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets such as those caused by the current COVID-19 outbreak may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our financial position.\nTo date, we have been able to access financing that has allowed us to make investments in growth opportunities and fund working capital requirements as needed. In addition, we occasionally enter into financial transactions to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Our continued access to capital markets, the stability of our lenders and their willingness to support our needs, and the stability of the counter parties to our financial transactions that hedge risks are essential for us to meet our current and long-term obligations, fund operations, and fund our future strategic initiatives. An interruption in our access to external financing or financial transactions to hedge risk could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAstroNova could experience a significant disruption in or security breach of our information technology system which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe employ information technology systems to support our business. Any security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations, compromise our information and that of our customers and suppliers, and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, suppliers and others including personally identifiable information, credit card data, and other confidential information. While we continually work to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches. As a result, our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, catastrophic events or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstance our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company\u2019s brand and reputation, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAstroNova could experience risks related to the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system.\nWe are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming all our operations to one global enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system. The ERP system is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, improve the efficiency of how we accurately maintain our books and records and enhance the speed and quality of information provided to our management team for use in the operation and management of our business. The implementation of the ERP system will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we will experience delays and increased costs as factors such as limited on-site availability of Company personnel and outside consultants due to travel restrictions and remote work conditions, as well as a redirection of personnel efforts toward responding to the COVID-19 outbreak from the implementation of the new ERP system. Significant disruption in the implementation and transition to the new ERP system as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak could negatively impact our ability to obtain the benefits that the new ERP system is intended to bring. The length of these delays and the related cost are unknown because of the uncertainty of the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Additionally, any significant disruption or deficiency in the design, implementation and transition to the new ERP system could negatively impact our ability to:\n\u2022\nrecord and process orders,\n\u2022\nmanufacture and ship our products in a timely manner, and\n\u2022\nprocess data and electronic communications among our business locations,\nany of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nWe also face the challenge of supporting our older systems while we implement the new ERP system. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, significant implementation issues may arise that impact our normal business operations and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cash flow.\nAstroNova depends on our key employees and other highly qualified personnel and our ability to attract and develop new, talented professionals. Our inability to attract and retain key employees could compromise our future success and our business could be harmed.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain professional and executive employees, including sales, operating, marketing, and financial management personnel. There is substantial competition for skilled personnel, and the failure to attract, develop, retain and motivate qualified personnel could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In order to hire new personnel or retain or replace our key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation, which would decrease net income. Additionally, a number of key employees have special knowledge of customers, supplier relationships, business processes, manufacturing operations, and financial management issues and the loss of any of these employees could harm the company\u2019s ability to perform efficiently and effectively until their knowledge and skills are replaced, which might be difficult to do quickly, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAstroNova is subject to laws and regulations; failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to laws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. In addition, we must comply with regulations restricting our ability to include lead and certain other substances in our products. If we do not\ncomply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted.\nCertain of our operations and products are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which may result in substantial compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, including those that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, establish standards for the use, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, and govern the cleanup of contaminated sites. We have used and continue to use various substances in our products and manufacturing operations, and have generated and continue to generate wastes, which have been or may be deemed to be hazardous or dangerous. As such, our business is subject to and may be materially and adversely affected by compliance obligations and other liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect ongoing operations and require capital costs and operating expenditures in order to achieve and maintain compliance.\nAs the result of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, we have been required by U.S. federal and state governmental authorities and governmental authorities in non-U.S. jurisdictions, as well as our own desire to adhere to best health and safety practices, to implement a number of policies and procedures that have increased our costs and added complexity and inefficiency to our manufacturing operations and all administrative and office-based functions.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that the Company or any of its subsidiaries has violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by those of our employees or agents who violate our policies.\nUnauthorized access to personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights and compliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly.\nAstroNova collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Security breaches or other unauthorized access to, or the use or transmission of, personal user information could result in a variety of claims against us, including privacy-related claims. There are numerous federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of this kind of information, the scope of which are changing, inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. For example, in 2016 the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a comprehensive privacy and data protection reform that became effective in May 2018. The GDPR, which is applicable to all companies processing data of European Union residents, imposes significant fines and sanctions for violations. Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 , which was enacted in June 2018 and came into effect\non January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties.\nAdditionally, other jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data generated in or relating to the residents of those jurisdictions to be physically stored within those jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws and regulations apply not only to transfers between unrelated third parties but also to transfers between the Company and its subsidiaries. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.\nWhile we continue to assess these requirements and the ways they may impact the conduct of our business, we believe that we materially comply with applicable laws and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. There is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws or codes of conduct, that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims or that we will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event we are found not to be in compliance with such laws or codes of conduct.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us (or any third parties with whom we have contracted to store such information) to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, policies or related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to personal information may result in governmental enforcement actions, significant fines, litigation, claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity. In the case of such an event, our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential users and the competitive positions of our various brands could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may record future impairment charges, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe test our goodwill balances annually, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and, in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates. We monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group, changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses, or small changes in other key assumptions, may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe also review our long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, and other intangibles assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider, whether as result of the COVID-19 outbreak, the 737 MAX grounding or otherwise, include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant negative industry or economic trends and our market capitalization relative to net book value. We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our long-lived assets is determined. Such charges could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and our financial condition.\nInadequate self-insurance accruals or insurance coverage for employee health care benefits, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results or financial condition.\nIn the U.S., we maintain an employee health insurance coverage plan on a self-insured basis backed by stop-loss coverage which sets a limit on our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs. We record expenses based on actual claims incurred and estimates of the costs of expected claims, administrative costs, and stop-loss insurance premiums.\nWe record a liability for our estimated cost of U.S. claims incurred and unpaid as of each balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is recorded on an undiscounted basis and is based on historical trends. Our history of claims activity is closely monitored, and liabilities are adjusted as warranted based on changing circumstances. It is possible, however, that our actual liabilities may exceed our estimates of loss. We may also experience an unexpectedly large number of claims that result in costs or liabilities in excess of our projections, which could cause us to record additional expenses, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We believe, that the liabilities we have recorded to date will be sufficient to provide for losses we may incur due to increased COVID-19 related employee health care insurance costs. However, the ultimate amount of these costs cannot be estimated at this time, and a prolonged period of spread of the disease could further increase our costs and liabilities, the impact of which may be material.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, inventories, business combinations and intangible asset valuations, leases, and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition.\nCompliance with rules governing \u201cconflict minerals\u201d could adversely affect the availability of certain product components and our costs and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nSEC rules require disclosures regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. We have determined that we use gold, tin and tantalum, each of which is considered a \u201cconflict mineral\u201d under the SEC rules, as they occur in electronic components supplied to us in the manufacture of our products. Because of this finding, we are required to conduct inquiries designed to determine whether any of the conflict minerals contained in our products originated or may have originated in the conflict region or come from recycled or scrap sources. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including performing due diligence in regards to the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation or other changes to products, processes or services of supplies that may be necessary as a consequence of such verification activities. As we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. As a result, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.",

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nAstroNova is a multi-national enterprise that leverages its proprietary data visualization technologies to design, develop, manufacture, distribute and service a broad range of products that acquire, store, analyze and present data in multiple formats. The Company organizes its structure around a core set of competencies, including research and development, manufacturing, service, marketing and distribution. We market and sell our products and services through the following two segments:\n\u2022\nProduct Identification (\u201cPI\u201d) - offers color and monochromatic digital label printers, over-printers and custom OEM printers. PI also offers software to design, manage and print labeling and packaging images locally and across networked printing systems, as well as all related printing supplies such as pressure sensitive labels, tags, inks, toners and thermal transfer ribbons used by digital printers. PI also provides on-site and remote service, spare parts and various service contracts.\n\u2022\nTest and Measurement (\u201cT&M\u201d) - offers a suite of products and services that acquire data from local and networked data streams and sensors as well as wired and wireless networks. The acquired data is processed and analyzed and then stored and presented in various visual output formats. The T&M segment includes a line of aerospace printers that are used to print hard copies of data required for the safe and efficient operation of aircraft including navigation maps, clearances, arrival and departure procedures, flight itineraries, weather maps, performance data, passenger data, and various air traffic control data. Aerospace products also include Ethernet switches which are used in military aircraft and military vehicles to connect multiple computers or Ethernet devices.\nThe Company markets and sells its products and services globally through a diverse distribution structure of direct sales personnel, manufacturers\u2019 representatives and authorized dealers that deliver a full complement of branded products and services to customers in our respective markets. Our growth strategy centers on organic growth through product innovation made possible by research and development initiatives, as well as strategic acquisitions that fit into or complement existing core businesses. In fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, revenue from customers in various geographic areas outside the United States, primarily in Western Europe, Canada and Asia, amounted to $49.8 million, $53.0 million and $43.6 million, respectively.\nWe maintain an active program of product research and development. During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we spent $8.1 million, $7.8 million and $7.5 million, respectively, on Company-sponsored product development. We are committed to continuous product development as essential to our organic growth and expect to continue our focus on research and development efforts in fiscal 2020 and beyond.\nWe also continue to invest in sales and marketing initiatives by expanding the existing sales force and using various marketing campaigns to achieve our goals of sales growth and increased profitability notwithstanding the challenging economic environment.\nIn fiscal 2018, AstroNova entered into an Asset Purchase and License Agreement (\u201cHoneywell Agreement\u201d) with Honeywell International, Inc. (\u201cHoneywell\u201d) pursuant to which, the Company acquired the exclusive perpetual world-wide license to manufacture Honeywell\u2019s narrow format flight deck printers for the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320 aircraft.\nIn March 2019 all major civil aviation authorities worldwide grounded the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft for safety reasons. In April 2019 Boeing reduced the number of aircraft produced per month from 52 to 42, and in January 2020, Boeing ceased production of the 737 MAX completely. AstroNova manufactures all three certified printer models in the Boeing catalog for the 737 MAX. The printer on the 737 MAX is buyer furnished equipment (BFE), which means the aircraft purchaser can choose which printer to have installed in the aircraft. Because the printer is BFE the purchaser of the aircraft purchases the printer directly from AstroNova and AstroNova delivers it to Boeing for installation on their aircraft. In some cases, a 737 MAX purchaser may choose to have the aircraft delivered without a printer. In such cases a printer can be added to the aircraft after delivery. Our records indicate that the vast majority of new 737 MAX of aircraft are delivered with one of our printers installed by Boeing. In addition to the drop off in orders for new aircraft printers, the 737 MAX grounding has negatively impacted our overall 737 printer upgrade business because operators have fewer available aircraft, so they are not in a position to take older model 737s out of service for upgrades. The grounding of the 737 MAX aircraft has also resulted in a reduced demand for aviation printer paper. These factors, in combination, had a material adverse impact on our revenues and profitability for fiscal 2020. At this time, it is not known when the Boeing 737 MAX will be certified for return to service, and it is also not known when Boeing will resume manufacturing and delivery. We expect that when manufacturing and delivery schedules are known, customers will begin to order printers from us for those aircraft. We also expect that the adverse impact on our revenue and profitability will continue until customer demand recovers. At this time, we believe that the demand for this aircraft will ultimately recover and further grow and we are making our operating decisions on that basis.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that COVID-19, a respiratory illness, caused by a novel coronavirus is a pandemic. COVID-19 has spread to many of the countries in which we, our customers, our suppliers and our other business partners conduct business. Governments in affected regions have implemented, and may continue to implement, safety precautions which include quarantines, travel restrictions, business closures, cancellations of public gatherings and other measures as they deem necessary. Many organizations and individuals, including the Company and its employees are taking additional steps to avoid or reduce infection, including limiting travel and staying home from work. These measures are disrupting normal business operations both in and outside of affected areas and have had significant negative impacts on businesses and financial markets worldwide.\nWe continue to monitor our operations and government recommendations and have made modifications to our normal operations because of the COVID-19 outbreak, including requiring most non-production related team\nmembers to work remotely. We have maintained a substantial portion of our manufacturing operational capacity at our primary manufacturing facilities located in West Warwick, Rhode Island, as well as in our manufacturing facilities in Canada and Germany, at this time, and we have instituted heightened cleaning and sanitization standards and several health and safety protocols and procedures to safeguard our team members.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has caused the Company to experience a number of adverse impacts, including reductions in demand for its products, delays and cancellations of orders for its products, difficulties in obtaining raw materials and components for its products, shortages of labor to manufacture products, inefficiencies caused by remote worker\u2019s difficulties in performing their normal work outputs, closures of the facilities of some of its suppliers and customers, delays in collecting accounts receivable. Disruptions in the capital markets as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak may also adversely affect the Company if these impacts continue for a prolonged period and the Company needs additional liquidity.\nThe rapid development and uncertainty of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company\u2019s business. However, COVID-19 and the measures taken to contain it present material uncertainty and risk with respect to the Company\u2019s performance and financial results. In particular, the aerospace industry, which the Company serves through its aerospace printer product line, has been significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 outbreak, both inside and outside of the United States. The decline in air travel and the impact of that decline on demand for our products from our airplane manufacturing customers, the airlines to which we sell directly and through the manufacturers, and the repair and overhaul market and the market for the paper consumed in the printers, could have a material adverse impact on the company\u2019s financial results.\nWe have reduced direct labor staffing levels in our aerospace manufacturing operations modestly, but the bulk of our expenses related to the aerospace product lines business will be unchanged because of the continued need to support our customers, and to provide the required sales, engineering, quality, and regulatory compliance and audit activities (among others) necessary to support the rest of the aerospace product line business.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019\nThe following table presents the revenue of each of the Company\u2019s segments, as well as the percentage of total revenue and change from the prior year.\nNet revenue in fiscal 2020 was $133.4 million, a 2.3% decrease compared to net revenue of $136.7 million for fiscal 2019. Current year revenue through domestic channels was $83.7 million, consistent with fiscal 2019 domestic revenue. International revenue of $49.8 million for fiscal 2020 decreased 6.1% compared to prior year international revenue of $53.0 million. Fiscal 2020 international revenue reflects an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $1.4 million, compared to a favorable impact of $0.6 million in fiscal 2019. International revenue declined primarily due to lower sales of Product Identification supplies in Europe.\nHardware revenue in fiscal 2020 was $49.0 million, a $4.2 million, or 8.0%, decrease compared to fiscal 2019 revenue of $53.2 million. The current year decrease in hardware revenue is primarily related to the decline in the aerospace printer product lines as a result of the effects of the Boeing 737 MAX grounding. This decline of aerospace printer hardware sales in the T&M segment was offset by a modest increase in sales of data acquisition recorders and other aerospace printers. The overall decline in hardware revenue for the current year was also\nattributable to the decline in sales in the PI segment of certain older model QuickLabel printers such as the QL-120 and QL-800, tempered by the product launch of the new QL-300 and QL-850 printers and increased sales of the TrojanLabel printers.\nRevenue from supplies in fiscal 2020 was $71.8 million, representing a $ 0.6 million, or 0.8%, increase compared to fiscal 2019 supplies revenue of $71.2 million. The dollar increase is primarily attributable to growth from Product Identification inkjet printer supplies. The current year increase in supplies revenue is tempered by older model lower thermal transfer and electrophotographic printer supplies revenue in the Quick Label product line, as well as a decline in revenue from the sale of specialized aerospace printer paper in the T&M segment.\nService and other revenue in fiscal 2020 was $12.6 million, a 3.1% increase compared to fiscal 2019 service and other revenue of $12.3 million. The current year increase is primarily due to the increase in parts sales and service revenue in the PI segment as a result of the increase in the installed base of printers. The current year increase in parts revenues in the AstroNova aerospace product line and increase in customer demand for parts in the data recorder product line in the T&M segment also contributed to the current year increase in service and other revenue.\nGross profit was $48.8 million for fiscal 2020, reflecting a 9.7% decline compared to fiscal 2019 gross profit of $54.0 million. The Company\u2019s gross profit margin of 36.5% in fiscal 2020 reflects a decrease compared to fiscal 2019 gross profit margin of 39.5%. The lower gross profit for the current year compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to a decline in revenue as well as higher period costs and adverse product mix.\nOperating expenses for the current year were $46.3 million, representing a 2.3% increase from the prior year\u2019s operating expenses of $45.3 million. Specifically, selling and marketing expenses of $26.9 million in fiscal 2020 increased 2.1% from the prior year amount of $26.3 million. The increase in selling and marketing expenses for the current year is due primarily to increases in wages and outside services expense which were slightly offset by lower employee benefits and commission expenses. Selling and marketing expenses represent 20.1% and 19.3% of net revenue for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Current year general and administrative (\u201cG&A\u201d) expenses increased by 2.1% from the prior year to $11.4 million, primarily as a result of an increase in expenses for outside services and professional fees. The current year increase in G&A is partly offset by lower bonuses and share-based compensation. Research & development (\u201cR&D\u201d) costs in fiscal 2020 of $8.1 million increased 3.5% from $7.8 million in fiscal 2019 primarily due to an increase in outside service expenses which were partially offset by lower bonus expenses in fiscal 2020. The R&D spending level for fiscal 2020 represents 6.1% of net revenue, an increase compared to the prior year level of 5.7%.\nOther expense in fiscal 2020 was $1.1 million compared to $1.4 million in fiscal 2019. Current year other expense includes interest expense on debt of $0.8 million and foreign exchange loss of $0.5 million, offset by investment and other income of $0.1 million. Other income in fiscal 2019 included interest expense on debt of $0.9 million and a foreign exchange loss of $0.7 million, offset by investment income and other of $0.2 million.\nNet income for fiscal 2020 was $1.8 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, a decrease compared to $5.7 million, or $0.81 per diluted share in fiscal 2019. Prior year results were impacted by $0.1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in taxes as a result of the Company\u2019s finalization of its accounting for the 2017 Tax Act. During fiscal 2020 the Company recognized a $0.4 million income tax benefit and had an effective tax rate of negative 28.4% compared to an income tax provision of $1.6 million, or a 21.6% effective tax rate for fiscal 2019. The decrease in the fiscal 2020 tax rate as compared to fiscal 2019 is primarily related to lower pre-tax income. Specific items decreasing the effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 include foreign derived intangible income, the release of ASC 740 liabilities, foreign tax credit utilization, and return to provision adjustments. This decrease was offset by valuation allowances recorded on unbenefited losses in China and on carryforward foreign tax credits expected to expire unused.\nFiscal 2019 compared to Fiscal 2018\nFor a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018, see \u201cPart II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations\u201d of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on April 10, 2019.\nSegment Analysis\nWe report two segments consistent with our product revenue groups: PI and T&M. Segment performance is evaluated based on the operating segment\u2019s profit before corporate and financial administration expenses. The following table summarizes selected financial information by segment.\nProduct Identification\nRevenue from the PI segment increased 1.5% in fiscal 2020 with revenue of $88.1 million compared to revenue of $86.8 million in the prior year. The current year increase is primarily attributable to growth in demand for ink jet supplies for both the QuickLabel and Trojan Label product lines. Also contributing to the increase in revenue for the current year was an increase in service and parts revenue. Hardware revenue in the PI segment declined slightly compared to the prior year; however, the segment did experience a significant revenue contribution from the introduction of QuickLabel\u2019s new QL-300, QL-120X and QL-850 printers, as well as continued growth in revenue from sales of both QuickLabel monochromatic printers and TrojanLabel brand printers. This growth was tempered by lower sales of other inkjet color printers within the QuickLabel product group, particularly the older models, QL-120 and QL-800. PI current year segment operating profit was $7.5 million with a profit margin of 8.5%, compared to the prior year segment operating profit of $7.9 million and related profit margin of 9.1%. The decrease in current year segment operating profit and margin is primarily due to higher operating costs and unfavorable product mix.\nTest & Measurement\nRevenue from the T&M product group was $45.3 million for fiscal 2020, a 9.1% decrease compared to revenue of $49.9 million in the prior year. The decrease in revenue for the current year is primarily attributable to the decline in the aerospace printer product lines impacted by the Boeing 737 MAX grounding. The decline was slightly offset by an increase in the hardware product line as a result of increased sales of T&M data recorders and AstroNova aerospace printers for programs other than the 737 MAX. The T&M segment also experienced an increase in parts revenue in the aerospace product line for fiscal 2020. T&M\u2019s current year segment operating profit was $6.3 million resulting in a 13.9% profit margin compared to the prior year segment operating profit of $11.9 million and related operating margin of 23.9%. The lower segment operating profit and related margin for the current year is due to lower revenue, adverse product mix and higher manufacturing and period costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nGenerally, our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, as described below. These sources also fund a portion of our capital expenditures and contractual contingent consideration obligations. Our level of cash and short-term financing capabilities along with cash flows from operations have historically been sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs. We believe that during the next 12 months the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to impact general economic activity and demand in our end markets, especially the Aerospace sector, to an extent that we will have to rely more heavily on external financing sources to meet our operating and capital needs. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our customers may also experience liquidity pressure and be unable to pay us for products and services on a timely basis. Conditions in the credit markets may also deteriorate and the availability of credit may be reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic such that we would not be able to access sufficient financing to support our operations, which would have a material adverse impact on our business. At this time, we expect that it is likely that we will violate the current terms of our credit agreement with Bank of America at the end of our first or second quarter of fiscal 2021. However, based on discussions with our lender, we expect to be able to renegotiate the terms of our credit agreement prior to any violations. If we are unable to renegotiate the terms of our credit agreement or secure alternative financing on acceptable terms, it will have a material adverse impact on the Company.\nDuring the current year, the Company borrowed an additional $5.0 million on its revolving credit facility, and at January 31, 2020 the Company had $6.5 million of borrowings outstanding under that facility. During fiscal 2019, we converted our securities available for sale to cash. Our cash and cash equivalents at January 31, 2020, were $4.2 million and we had $11.0 million remaining available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility.\nIn April 2020, the Company applied for a loan in the amount of approximately $4.4 million from Bank of America, N.A. pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program administered by the United States Small Business Administration and authorized by the Keeping American Workers Employed and Paid Act, which is part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, enacted on March 27, 2020. There can be no assurance that the Company will receive any or all of the requested loan proceeds under this program.\nIndebtedness\nThe Company and the Company\u2019s wholly owned Danish subsidiaries, ANI ApS and TrojanLabel ApS (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d), are parties to a credit agreement (\u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Bank of America, N.A. The Credit Agreement and its subsequent amendments through fiscal 2019 provided for a secured credit facility consisting of a term loan to ANI ApS in the principal amount of $9.2 million, a term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million and a $10.0 million revolving credit facility for the Company. On December 9, 2019, the Parties entered into a Fourth Amendment (the \u201cFourth Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate amount available for borrowings under the revolving line of credit prior to November 1, 2020 from $10.0 million to $17.5 million through the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and (ii) modify the financial covenants with which the Company must comply thereunder by excluding certain capital expenditures from the calculation of the Company\u2019s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, providing that the minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenant will be suspended through the second quarter of fiscal 2021, and adding a minimum consolidated EBITDA covenant commencing with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and continuing through the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\nBoth term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio.\nIn connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement, ANI ApS entered into a hedging agreement to manage the variable interest rate risk and currency risk associated with its payments in respect to the term loan.\nUnder this combined arrangement, payments of principal and interest with respect to approximately $8.9 million of the principal of the term loan will be made in Danish Kroner, and interest on such principal amount will be payable at a fixed rate of 0.67% per annum for the entire term, subject only to potential changes based on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio. Additionally, the Company entered into a hedging agreement to manage the variable interest rate risk associated with its payments with respect to the $15.0 million term loan. Under this combined arrangement, interest will be payable at a fixed rate of 2.04% per annum for the entire term, plus an incremental margin of 1.0% to 1.5%, based on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio.\nRevolving credit loans may be borrowed, at the Company\u2019s option, in U.S. Dollars or, subject to certain conditions, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars or Danish Kroner. Amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company\u2019s option, either (a) the LIBOR rate (or, in the case of revolving credit loans denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, the applicable quoted rate), plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) a fluctuating reference rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds\u2019 rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of America\u2019s publicly announced prime rate or (iii) the LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, plus a margin that varies within a range of 0.0% to 0.5% based on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility at the rate of 0.25% per annum. Outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit line during fiscal 2020 bore interest at a weighted average annual rate of 4.81% and the Company has incurred $0.5 million of interest expense for revolving credit line borrowings for the year ended January 31, 2020.\nThe obligations of ANI ApS in respect of the $9.2 million term loan are guaranteed by the Company and TrojanLabel ApS. The Company\u2019s obligations in respect of the $15.0 million term loan, revolving credit facility and its guarantee in respect of the ANI ApS term loan are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company (including a pledge of a portion of the equity interests held by the Company in ANI ApS and the Company\u2019s wholly-owned German subsidiary, AstroNova GmbH), subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Lender is entitled to accelerate repayment of the loans and to terminate its revolving credit commitment under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of any of various customary events of default.\nThe Parties must comply with various customary financial and non-financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nAs of January 31, 2020, the Company believes it is in compliance with all of the covenants in the Credit Agreement.\nCash Flow\nThe statements of cash flows for the years ended January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are included on page 49 of this Form 10-K. Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 million in fiscal 2020 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $5.0 million in the previous year. The decrease in net cash provided by operations for the current year is primarily due to a decrease in net income of $4.0 million partially offset by a decrease in cash used for working capital of $2.1 million from fiscal 2019. The changes in accounts receivable, inventory, income taxes, accounts payable and accrued expenses for the current year decreased cash by $4.8 million in fiscal compared to $6.9 million the prior year.\nThe accounts receivable balance decreased to $19.8 million at January 31, 2020, compared to $23.5 at January 31, 2019. The $3.7 million decrease in the accounts receivable balance is directly related to the decrease in sales for the fourth quarter of the current year to $30.5 million from $37.2 million in the prior year.\nThe year-end inventory balance increased to $33.9 million at January 31, 2020. versus $30.2 million at January 31, 2019 and the days inventory on hand increased to 151 days at the end of fiscal 2020 as compared to 120 days at the end of the fiscal 2019. The current period increase in inventory and related days on hand is due to lower-than-forecasted sales, as well as a buildup of inventory for new product launches in our Product\nIdentification segment and build-up of safety stock to fulfill requirements related to the transitioning of certain aerospace customers as a result of the Honeywell Agreement. Also contributing to the inventory increase were delayed shipments to customers in both segments that were subsequently shipped after year end and last-time buy parts and safety stock increases in the T&M segment.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $5.0 million in fiscal 2019 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $3.7 million in the previous year. The increase in net cash provided by operations for fiscal year 2019 is primarily due to an increase in net income of $2.4 million, an increase in non-cash amortization related to the Honeywell acquisition partially offset by the payment of the prior year\u2019s accrued expenses to Honeywell under the TSA agreement.\nThe accounts receivable balance was $23.5 million at the end of fiscal year 2019 compared to $22.4 million at the end of fiscal 2018, although the collection cycle decreased to 49 days compared to 55 days at year end. The inventory balance increased to $30.2 million at the end of fiscal 2019, compared to $27.6 million at the end of fiscal 2018 with the inventory days on hand decreasing to 120 days at the end of the current year from 124 days at the prior year end.\nNet cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2020 was $2.9 million for capital expenditures, consisting of $0.4 million for land and building improvements; $1.9 million for information technology; $0.2 million for machinery and equipment; $0.2 million for tools and dies; and $0.2 million for furniture, fixtures and other capital expenditures.\nNet cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2019 was $1.5 million, which included $2.6 million for capital expenditures, consisting of $0.1 million for land and building improvements; $1.5 million for information technology; $0.7 million for machinery and equipment; $0.2 million for tools and dies; and $0.1 million for furniture, fixtures and other capital expenditures. Cash used for investments in fiscal 2019 was partially offset by $1.5 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of securities available for sale.\nNet cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2018 was $20.8 million, which included $23.9 million of cash paid for the TrojanLabel acquisition and the Honeywell Agreement, partially offset by $5.5 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of securities available for sale. Cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2018 included capital expenditures of $2.2 million, consisting of $0.7 million for land and building improvements; $0.7 million for information technology; $0.5 million for machinery and equipment; $0.2 million for tools and dies; and $0.1 million for furniture, fixtures and other capital expenditures.\nNet cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2020 was $3.7 million, consisting primarily of principal payments on long-term debt of $5.2 million and the guaranteed royalty obligation of $1.9 million. Cash used for financing was partially offset by borrowings of $5.0 million on the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility in fiscal 2020. The Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in fiscal 2020. Cash provided or used by financing activities also included cash used to pay dividends of $2.0 million in fiscal 2020 and $1.9 million in both fiscal 2019 and 2018.\nNet cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2019 was $6.1 million, primarily as a result of principal payments of $5.1 million on long-term debt, $1.5 million on the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility and $1.6 million on the guaranteed royalty obligations. Cash used for financing was partially offset by borrowings of $3.0 million on the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility in fiscal 2019. The Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in fiscal 2019.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2018 was $9.1 million and includes $24.2 million of proceeds related to the issuance of debt under the Company\u2019s credit facility with Bank of America. Offsetting the cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2018 was $11.2 million of cash used to repurchase 826,305 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a per share price of $13.60. The purchase of these shares was from a trust established by the former founder and chief executive officer of the Company and did not impact the shares authorized for future purchases as part of the Company\u2019s stock buyback program.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nAt January 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s contractual obligations with initial remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows:\n(1) Purchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price, quantity and delivery dates.\n(2) Interest rate on variable rate debt is provided at the effective fixed rate paid by the Company per the hedging arrangements plus the maximum additional margin payable based on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio of 1.5%.\n(3) The Company is subject to a guaranteed minimum royalty payment obligation over the next ten years pursuant to the Honeywell Asset Purchase and License Agreement. Refer to Note 9, \u201cRoyalty Obligation\u201d in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details.\n(4) The Company is subject to excess royalty payments beyond the guaranteed minimum royalty obligation pursuant to the Honeywell Asset Purchase & License Agreement. Refer to Note 9, \u201cRoyalty Obligation,\u201d in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details.\nThe Company is also subject to contingencies, including legal proceedings and claims arising out of its businesses that cover a wide range of matters, such as: contract and employment claims; workers compensation claims; product liability claims; warranty claims; and claims related to modification, adjustment or replacement of component parts of units sold. While it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to contingent liabilities, including lawsuits, we believe that the aggregate amount of such liabilities, if any, in excess of amounts provided or covered by insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. It is possible, however, that results of operations for any future period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies or changes out of the Company\u2019s control.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We periodically evaluate the judgments and estimates used for our critical accounting policies to ensure that such judgments and estimates are reasonable for our interim and year-end reporting requirements. These judgments and estimates are based on the Company\u2019s historical experience, current trends and information available from other sources, as appropriate. If different conditions result from those assumptions used in our judgments, the results could be materially different from our estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nRevenue Recognition: Effective February 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-9, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and the related amendments (also referred to as\nTopic 606) using the modified retrospective method. Topic 606 was applied to all contracts within the scope of Topic 606 as of the February 1, 2018 adoption date. Under ASC Topic 606, based on the nature of our contracts and consistent with prior practice, we recognize most of our revenue upon shipment, which is when the performance obligation has been satisfied. Accordingly, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our revenue recognition and there was no cumulative effective adjustment as of February 1, 2018 as a result of the adoption of ASC Topic 606.\nOur accounting policies relating to the recognition of revenue under Topic 606 require management to make estimates, determinations and judgments based on historical experience and on various other assumptions, which include (i) the existence of a contract with the customer, (ii) the identification of the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) the value of any variable consideration in the contract, (iv) the stand alone selling price of multiple obligations in the contract, for the purpose of allocating the consideration in the contract, and (v) determining when a performance obligation has been met. Recognition of revenue based on incorrect judgments, including the identification of performance obligation arrangements as well as the pattern of delivery for those services, could result in inappropriate recognition of revenue, or incorrect timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe recognize revenue for non-recurring engineering (NRE) fees, as necessary, for product modification orders upon completion of agreed-upon milestones. Revenue is deferred for any amounts received prior to completion of milestones. Certain of our NRE arrangements include formal customer acceptance provisions. In such cases, we determine whether we have obtained customer acceptance for the specific milestone before recognizing revenue.\nInfrequently, the Company receives requests from customers to hold product being purchased from us for the customers\u2019 convenience. We recognize revenue for such bill and hold arrangements in accordance with the guidance provided by Topic 606, which requires the transaction to meet the following criteria in order to determine that the customer has obtained control: (a) the reason for the bill and hold is substantive, (b) the product has separately been identified as belonging to the customer, (c) the product is currently ready for physical transfer to the customer, and (d) the Company does not have the ability to use the product or direct it to another customer.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts: Accounts receivable consists primarily of receivables from our customers arising from the sale of our products. We actively monitor our exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits. Accounts receivable is presented net of reserves for doubtful accounts.\nWe estimate the collectability of our receivables and establish allowances for accounts receivable that we estimate to be uncollectible. We base these allowances on our historical collection experience, the length of time our accounts receivable are outstanding and the financial condition of individual customers. In situations where we are aware of a specific customer\u2019s inability to meet its financial obligation, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing, we assess the need for a specific reserve for bad debts. We believe that our procedure for estimating such amounts are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods. Bad debt expense was less than 1% of net sales in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019.\nWarranty Claims: The Company offers warranties on some of its products. The Company establishes a reserve for estimated costs of warranties at the time the product revenue is recognized. This reserve requires us to make estimates regarding the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims using historical data on products sold as of the balance sheet date. The length of the warranty period, the product\u2019s failure rates, and the customer\u2019s usage affect estimated warranty cost. If actual warranty costs differ from the Company\u2019s estimated amounts, future results of operations could be affected adversely. Warranty cost is recorded as cost of revenue, and the reserve balance recorded as an accrued expense. While the Company maintains product quality programs and processes, its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and the related corrective costs. If actual product failure rates and/or corrective costs differ from the estimates, the Company revises its estimated warranty liability accordingly.\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. The process for evaluating and recording obsolete and excess inventory provisions consists of analyzing the inventory supply on hand and estimating the net realizable value of the inventory based on historical experience, current business conditions and anticipated future revenue. We believe that our procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual experience.\nIncome Taxes: A valuation allowance is established when it is \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence must be considered, including our performance, the market environment in which we operate, length of carryforward periods, existing revenue backlog and future revenue projections. If actual factors and conditions differ materially from the estimates made by management, the actual realization of the net deferred tax assets or liabilities could vary materially from the amounts previously recorded. At January 31, 2020, the Company has provided valuation allowances for future tax benefits resulting from certain domestic R&D tax credits, foreign tax credit carryforwards, and net operating loss carryforwards in China, all of which could expire unused.\nThe calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although guidance on the accounting for uncertain income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. If the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what we have estimated, our income tax expense could be materially impacted.\nOn December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted into law in the U.S. and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among others. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cSAB 118\u201d), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. All accounting under SAB 118 was finalized during the quarter ending January 31, 2019 with no material changes from the provisional amounts previously recorded.\nIntangible and Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, such as definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by the discounting of future cash flows.\nGoodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a business unit one level below an operating segment if discrete financial information for that business is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. However, components within an operating segment are aggregated as a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. Management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as declines in revenue, earnings or cash flows, or material adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired. Goodwill is first qualitatively assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Factors that management considers in this assessment include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance (both current and projected), changes in management and strategy and changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets. If this qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a quantitative assessment is required for the reporting unit. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. We\nestimate the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach based upon a discounted cash flow model. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit\u2019s expected long-term operating cash flow performance. In addition, we use the market approach, which compares the reporting unit to publicly traded companies and transactions involving similar business, to support the conclusions based upon the income approach. The income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenue, expenses, capital expenditures, and working capital, as well as discount factors and income tax rates. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets including goodwill assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit\u2019s net assets including goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we record an impairment charge based on that difference.\nSelf-Insurance Liability Accrual: We maintain self-insured group medical and dental programs for qualifying employees and maintain stop-loss coverage from a third party which limits our exposure to large claims. We record a liability associated with these benefits that includes an estimate of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported based on historical claims experience. In estimating this accrual, we utilize an independent third-party broker to estimate of expected losses, which are based on analyses of historical data. Our assumptions are closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. Should claims occur or medical costs increase in greater amounts than we have expected, accruals may not be sufficient, and we may record additional expenses.\nShare-Based Compensation: Share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the share-based award when granted and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). We have estimated the fair value of each option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Our estimate of share-based compensation requires several complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility, employee exercise patterns (expected life of the options), the risk-free interest rate and the Company\u2019s dividend yield. The stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical weekly price data of our common stock over a period equivalent to the weighted-average expected life of our options. Management evaluated whether there were factors during that period which were unusual and would distort the volatility figure if used to estimate future volatility and concluded that there were no such factors. In determining the expected life of the option grants, the Company has observed the actual terms of prior grants with similar characteristics and the actual vesting schedule of the grants and assessed the expected risk tolerance of different option groups. The risk-free interest rate used in the model is based on the actual U.S. Treasury zero coupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option as of the option grant date. The dividend assumption is based upon the prior year\u2019s average dividend yield. No compensation expense is recognized for options that are forfeited for which the employee does not render the requisite service. Our accounting for share-based compensation for restricted stock awards (RSA) and restricted stock units (RSU) is also based on the fair value method. The fair value of the RSUs and RSAs is based on the closing market price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant. Reductions in compensation expense associated with forfeited awards are estimated at the date of grant, and this estimated forfeiture rate is adjusted periodically based on actual forfeiture experience.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nReference is made to Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe have exposure to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nFinancial Exchange Risk\nThe functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries and branches are the local currencies - the British Pound in the U.K., the Canadian Dollar in Canada, the Danish Kroner in Denmark, the Chinese Yuan in China, and the Euro in France and Germany. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as the functional currency financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. The assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries having a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, and at an average exchange rate for the reporting period for revenue and expense accounts. The cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders\u2019 equity. The reported results of our foreign subsidiaries will be influenced by their translation into U.S. dollars by currency movements against the U.S. dollar. Our primary currency translation exposure is related to our subsidiaries that have functional currencies denominated in Euro. A hypothetical 10% change in the rates used to translate the results of our foreign subsidiaries would result in an increase or decrease in our consolidated net income of less than $0.1 million for the year ended January 31, 2020.\nTransactional exposure arises where transactions occur in currencies other than the functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. The resulting monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the appropriate functional currency at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date and the resulting gains and losses are reported as foreign exchange gain (loss) in the consolidated statements of income. Realized and unrealized foreign exchange losses resulting from transactional exposure were $0.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2020.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company has exposure to interest rate risk from its variable rate long-term debt. We entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate exposure related to our variable rate debt. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. Giving effect to our interest rate swaps, if interest rates were to decrease by 50 basis points, the fair value of the Company\u2019s debt would increase by approximately $0.1 million. If interest rates were to increase by 50 basis points, the fair value of the Company\u2019s debt would decrease by approximately $0.1 million.",

Warzala\nDirector\nApril 10, 2020\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Shareholders and Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nAstroNova, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AstroNova, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2020 and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a)(2)(collectively, the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Wolf & Company, P.C.\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2013.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nApril 10, 2020\nASTRONOVA, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAs of January 31\n(In Thousands, Except Share Data)\nSee Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nASTRONOVA, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nFor the years ended January 31\n(In Thousands, Except Per Share Data)\nSee Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nASTRONOVA, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFor the years ended January 31\n(In Thousands)\nSee Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nASTRONOVA, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\n($ In Thousands)\nSee Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nASTRONOVA, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nFor the years ended January 31\n(In Thousands)\nSee Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nASTRONOVA, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJanuary 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nNote 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation: The accompanying financial data have been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). Our fiscal year end is January 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.\nPrinciples of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AstroNova, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nReclassification: Certain amounts in prior year\u2019s financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year\u2019s presentation.\nUse of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect these financial statements and accompanying notes. Some of the more significant estimates relate to the allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, valuation and estimated lives of intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill, income taxes, share-based compensation and warranty reserves. Management\u2019s estimates are based on the facts and circumstances available at the time estimates are made, past historical experience, risk of loss, general economic conditions and trends, and management\u2019s assessments of the probable future outcome of these matters. Consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents: Highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less are considered to be cash equivalents. Similar investments with original maturities beyond three months are classified as securities available for sale. At January 31, 2020 and 2019, $3.4 million and $3.9 million, respectively, was held in foreign bank accounts.\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value and include material, labor and manufacturing overhead.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (land improvements-10 to 20 years; buildings and leasehold improvements-10 to 45 years; machinery and equipment-3 to 10 years and computer equipment and software-3 to 10 years).\nRevenue Recognition: On February 1, 2018 we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cTopic 606\u201d),\u201d which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. Topic 606 defines a five step process to recognize revenue and requires more judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process than required under previous U.S. GAAP, which includes identifying contracts with customers, identifying performance obligations in the contract, determining and estimating the amount of any variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation and recognizing revenue when the entity satisfies each performance obligation.\nWe adopted this standard using the modified retrospective method and have applied the guidance to all contracts within the scope of Topic 606 as of the February 1, 2018 adoption date. Under Topic 606, based on the nature of our contracts and consistent with prior practice, we recognize most of our revenue upon shipment, which is when the performance obligation has been satisfied. Accordingly, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our revenue recognition and there was no cumulative effective adjustment as of February 1, 2018 as a result of the adoption of Topic 606.\nThe vast majority of our revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at the contractually stated prices, and is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a product to a customer. The transfer of control generally occurs at one point in time, upon shipment, when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue.\nMany of the contracts entered into with customers are commonly comprised of a combination of equipment, supplies, installation and/or training services. We determine performance obligations by assessing whether the products or services are distinct from other elements of the contract. In order to be distinct, the product must perform either on its own or with readily available resources and must be separate within the context of the contract.\nMost of our hardware products contain embedded operating systems and data management software which is included in the purchase price of the equipment. The software is deemed incidental to the systems as a whole, as it is not sold or marketed separately, and its production costs are minor compared to those of the hardware system. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and are accounted for as a single performance obligation for which revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to the customer.\nInstallation and training services vary based on certain factors such as the complexity of the equipment, staffing availability in a geographic location and customer preferences, and can range from a few days to a few months. The delivery of installation and training services are not assessed to determine whether they are separate performance obligations, as the amounts are not material to the contract.\nShipping and handling activities that occur after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations, as allowed under a practical expedient provided by Topic 606. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are included in cost of revenue at the point in time when ownership of the product is transferred to the customer.\nWe may perform service at the request of the customer, generally for the repair and maintenance of products previously sold. These services are short in duration, typically less than one month, and total less than 10% of revenue for the year ended January 31, 2020. Revenue is recognized as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. We also provide service agreements on certain of our Product Identification equipment. Service agreements are purchased separately from the equipment and provide for the right to obtain service and maintenance on the equipment for a period of typically one to two years. Accordingly, revenue on these agreements is recognized over the term of the agreements. The portion of service agreement contracts that are uncompleted at the end of any reporting period are included in deferred revenue.\nWe generally provide warranties for our products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months for most hardware products except for airborne printers, which typically have warranties that extend for 4-5 years, consistent with industry practice. Such assurance-type warranties are not deemed to be separate performance obligations from the hardware product and costs associated with providing the warranties are accrued in accordance with ASC 450, \u201cContingencies,\u201d as we have the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. Our estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that our experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting adjustment to cost of revenue. On occasion, customers request a warranty period longer than our standard warranty. In those instances, in which extended warranty services are separately quoted to the customer, an additional performance obligation is created, and the associated revenue is deferred and recognized as service revenue ratably over the term of the extended warranty period. The portion of service contracts and extended warranty services agreements that are uncompleted at the end of any reporting period are included in deferred revenue.\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. There has been no change in the Company\u2019s accounting for these contracts as a result of the adoption of Topic 606. Costs related to obtaining sales contracts for our aerospace printer products have been capitalized and are being amortized based on the forecasted number of units sold over the estimated benefit term. We apply the practical expedient to expense costs incurred for costs to obtain a contract when the amortization period would have been less than a year These costs include sales commissions paid to the internal direct sales team as well as to third-party representatives and distributors. Contractual agreements with each of these parties outline commission structures and rates to be paid. Generally speaking, the contracts are all individual procurement decisions by the customers and do not include renewal provisions and as such the majority of the contracts have an economic life of significantly less than a year.\nAccounts Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Standard payment terms are typically 30 days after shipment but vary by type and geographic location of our customer. Credit is extended based upon an evaluation of the customer\u2019s financial condition. In circumstances where we are aware of a customer\u2019s inability to meet its financial obligations, an allowance is established. The remainder of the allowance established is based on a variety of factors, including the age of amounts outstanding relative to their contractual due date, historical write-off experience and current market assessments. Accounts receivable are stated at their estimated net realizable value.\nResearch and Development Costs: We charge costs to expense in the period incurred, and these expenses are presented in the consolidated statement of income. The following costs are included in research and development expense: salaries and benefits, external engineering service costs, engineering related information costs and supplies.\nForeign Currency Translation: The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and branches are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with the translation adjustment recorded as a component of accumulated comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders\u2019 equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average monthly exchange rates in effect during the related period. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on foreign currency translation adjustments associated with our subsidiaries in Germany, Denmark and China since their undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently invested. Our net transactional foreign exchange losses included in the consolidated statements of income were $0.4 million in fiscal 2020, $0.7 million in fiscal 2019 and $0.2 million for fiscal 2018.\nAdvertising: The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs including advertising production, trade shows and other activities are designed to enhance demand for our products and amounted to approximately $1.8 million; $1.9 million and $1.8 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLong-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, as determined by the discounting of future cash flows. For 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were no impairment charges for long-lived assets.\nIntangible Assets: Intangible assets include the value of customer and distributor relationships, existing technology and non-competition agreements acquired in connection with business and asset acquisitions and are stated at cost (fair value at acquisition) less accumulated amortization. These intangible assets have a definite life and are amortized over the assets\u2019 useful lives using a systematic and rational basis which is representative of the assets\u2019 use. Intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If necessary, an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in\ndetermining the fair value of the asset. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset\u2019s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. For 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were no impairment charges for intangible assets.\nGoodwill: Management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as declines in revenue, earnings or cash flows, or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business unit one level below an operating segment if discrete financial information for that business is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. However, components within an operating segment are aggregated as a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. We determined that each of our operating segments (Product Identification and T&M) represents a reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.\nThe accounting guidance related to goodwill impairment testing allows for the performance of an optional qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Factors that management considers in this qualitative assessment include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance (both current and projected), changes in management and strategy and changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets. If this qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then a quantitative assessment is required for the reporting unit. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach based upon a discounted cash flow model. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit\u2019s expected long-term operating cash flow performance. In addition, the Company uses the market approach, which compares the reporting unit to publicly traded companies and transactions involving similar business, to support the conclusions based upon the income approach. The income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenue, expenses, capital expenditures, and working capital, as well as discount factors and income tax rates. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets including goodwill assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit\u2019s net assets including goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we record an impairment charge based on that difference.\nWe performed a qualitative assessment for our fiscal 2020 analysis of goodwill. Based on this assessment, management does not believe that it is more likely than not that the carrying values of the reporting units exceed their fair values. Accordingly, no quantitative assessment was performed, as management believes that there are no impairment issues in regard to goodwill at this time.\nLeases: On February 1, 2019 the Company adopted ASC 842, Leases. This new guidance requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases, with the result being the recognition of a right of use (ROU) asset and a lease liability. The lease liability is equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments for the term of the lease, including any optional renewal periods determined to be reasonably certain to be exercised, using a discount rate determined at lease commencement. This discount rate is the rate implicit in the lease, if known; otherwise, the incremental borrowing rate for the expected lease term is used. The Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate approximates the rate the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term at lease inception. The value of the ROU asset is equal to the initial measurement of the lease liability plus any lease payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date and any unamortized initial direct costs incurred by the lessee, less any unamortized lease incentives received. Several of the Company\u2019s lease contracts include options to extend the lease term and the Company includes the renewal options for these leases in the determination of the ROU asset and lease liability when the likelihood of renewal is determined to be reasonably certain.\nThe Company enters into lease contracts for certain of its facilities at various locations worldwide. At inception of a contract, the Company determines whether the contract is or contains a lease. If the Company has a\nright to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the asset, then the contract contains a lease.\nThere are two types of leases, operating leases and finance leases. Lease classification is determined at lease commencement. The Company has made an accounting policy election to apply the short-term exception, which does not require the capitalization of leases with terms of 12 months or less. All of the Company\u2019s leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in general and administrative expense on the consolidated statement of income. ROU assets are classified in other long-term assets, short-term lease liabilities are classified in other current liabilities, and long-term lease liabilities are classified in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at January 31, 2020. On the statement of cash flow, payments for operating leases are classified as operating activities for the year ending January 31, 2020.\nIn addition, several of our lease agreements include non-lease components for items such as common area maintenance and utilities which are accounted for separately from the lease component.\nIncome Taxes: We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of the assets and liabilities and are measured using statutory tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company\u2019s deferred taxes are presented as non-current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. An allowance against deferred tax assets is recognized when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At January 31, 2020 and 2019, a valuation allowance was provided for deferred tax assets attributable to certain domestic R&D credit carryforwards. In addition, during fiscal 2020, the Company provided a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets attributable to foreign tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards in China, both of which would expire unused.\nAstroNova accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance provided in ASC 740, \u201cAccounting for Income Taxes.\u201d This guidance describes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and requires recognition of tax benefits that satisfy a more-likely-than-not threshold. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure.\nOn December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among others. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cSAB 118\u201d), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. All accounting under SAB 118 was finalized during the quarter ending January 31, 2019 with no material changes from the provisional amounts previously recorded.\nNet Income Per Common Share: Basic net income per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is based on the basic weighted average number of shares and potential common equivalent shares for stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. In fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were 202,187, 326,275 and 675,600, respectively, of common equivalent shares that were not included in the computation of diluted net income per common share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.\nFair Value Measurement: We measure our financial assets at fair value on a recurring basis in accordance with the guidance provided in ASC 820, \u201cFair Value Measurement and Disclosures,\u201d which defines fair value as\nthe price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In addition, ASC 820 establishes a three-tiered hierarchy for inputs used in management\u2019s determination of fair value of financial instruments that emphasizes the use of observable inputs over the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect management\u2019s belief about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing a financial instrument based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nThe fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows:\n\u2022\nLevel 1-Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n\u2022\nLevel 2-Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and\n\u2022\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities\nCash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued compensation, other accrued expenses and income tax payable are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\nSelf-Insurance: We are self-insured for U.S. medical and dental benefits for qualifying employees and maintain stop-loss coverage from a third party which limits our exposure to large claims. We record a liability associated with these benefits that includes an estimate of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported based on historical claims experience. In estimating this accrual, we utilize an independent third-party broker to estimate expected losses, which are based on analyses of historical data. Assumptions are closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. Our liability for self-insured claims is included within accrued compensation in our consolidated balance sheets and was $0.6 million and $0.1 million, as of January 31, 2020 and 2019.\nShare-Based Compensation: Share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the share-based award when granted and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). We have estimated the fair value of each option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Our estimate of share-based compensation requires several complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility, employee exercise patterns (expected life of the options), the risk-free interest rate and the Company\u2019s dividend yield. The stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical weekly price data of our common stock over a period equivalent to the weighted average expected life of our options. Management evaluated whether there were factors during that period which were unusual and would distort the volatility figure if used to estimate future volatility and concluded that there were no such factors. In determining the expected life of the option grants, the Company has observed the actual terms of prior grants with similar characteristics and the actual vesting schedule of the grant and has assessed the expected risk tolerance of different option groups. The risk-free interest rate is based on the actual U.S. Treasury zero coupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option as of the option grant date. The dividend assumption is based upon the prior year\u2019s average dividend yield. No compensation expense is recognized for options that are forfeited for which the employee does not render the requisite service. Our accounting for share-based compensation for restricted stock awards (RSA) and restricted stock units (RSU) is also based on the fair value method. The fair value of the RSUs and RSAs is based on the closing market price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the grant date. Reductions in compensation expense associated with forfeited awards are estimated at the date of grant, and this estimated forfeiture rate is adjusted periodically based on actual forfeiture experience.\nCash flow from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options (excess tax benefits) is classified with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity.\nShare-based compensation becomes deductible for determining income taxes when the related award vests, is exercised, or is forfeited depending on the type of share-based award and subject to relevant tax law.\nDerivative Financial Instruments: The Company uses derivative instruments as part of its overall strategy to manage its exposure to market risks primarily associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss is recognized in the statement of income during the current period. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction, and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings (e.g., in \u201cInterest Expense\u201d when the hedged transactions are interest cash flows associated with floating-rate debt, or \u201cOther, Net\u201d for portions reclassified relating to the remeasurement of the debt). The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item, if any, are recognized in the statement of income during the current period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted:\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842).\u201d ASU 2016-02 and its subsequent amendments superseded previous guidance related to accounting for leases and are intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities in the balance sheet for operating leases with lease terms greater than twelve months. The updates also require improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.\nThe Company applied ASU 2016-02 to all leases in effect at February 1, 2019 and adopted this standard using the non-comparative transition option, which does not require the restatement of prior years. Accordingly, comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under the previous accounting guidance. The Company has elected the package of practical expedients, which allows entities to not reassess (1) whether contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. Also, the Company has made an accounting policy election to apply the short-term exception, which does not require the capitalization of leases with terms of 12 months or less. On February 1, 2019, the Company recognized $2.0 million of Right of Use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and lease liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet and currently has $1.7 million of ROU assets as of January 31, 2020. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations or cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted:\nFair Value Measurement\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, \u201cFair Value Measurement (Topic 820), Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.\u201d ASU 2018-13 modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying or adding certain disclosures. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 including interim periods within those\nfiscal years (Q1 fiscal 2021 for AstroNova), with early adoption permitted. The provisions of ASU 2018-13 relating to changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. The remaining provisions should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNo other new accounting pronouncements, issued or effective during fiscal 2020, have had or are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 2-Revenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue from the sale of (i) hardware including, digital color label printers and specialty OEM printing systems, portable data acquisition systems and airborne printers used in the flight deck and in the cabin of military, commercial and business aircraft, (ii) related consumable supplies including paper, labels, tags, inks, toners and ribbons, (iii) repairs and maintenance of equipment and (iv) service agreements.\nRevenues disaggregated by primary geographic markets and major product types are as follows:\nPrimary geographical markets:\nMajor product types:\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nWe normally do not have contract assets, which are primarily unbilled accounts receivable that are conditional on something other than the passage of time. Our contract liabilities, which represent billings in excess of revenue recognized, are related to advanced billings for purchased service agreements and extended warranties. Contract liabilities were $466,000 and $373,000 at January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, respectively and are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheet. During the year ended January 31, 2020, the Company recognized $361,000 of revenue that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period.\nContract Costs\nWe have determined that certain costs related to obtaining sales contracts for our aerospace printer products meet the requirement to be capitalized. These costs are deferred and amortized based on the forecasted number of units sold over the estimated benefit term. The balance of these contract assets at January 31, 2019 was $903,000 of which $109,000 was reported in other current assets and $794,000 was reported in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. In fiscal 2020, the Company incurred an additional $120,000 in incremental direct costs which were deferred. Amortization of incremental direct costs was $79,000 for the period ended January 31, 2020. The balance of the deferred incremental direct contract costs net of accumulated amortization at January 31, 2020 is $944,000, of which $59,000 was reported in other current assets and $885,000 was reported in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The contract costs are expected to be amortized over the estimated remaining period of benefit, which we currently estimate to be approximately 6 years.\nNote 3-Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets are as follows:\nThere were no impairments to intangible assets during the periods ended January 31, 2020 and 2019. Amortization expense of $4.2 million; $4.1 million and $2.2 million with regard to acquired intangibles has been included in the consolidated statements of income for years ended January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nEstimated amortization expense for the next five fiscal years is as follows:\nNote 4-Inventories\nThe components of inventories are as follows:\nFinished goods inventory includes $3.4 million and $2.1 million of demonstration equipment at January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNote 5-Property, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment consist of the following:\nDepreciation expense on property, plant and equipment was $2.0 million for both of the years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019 and $1.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2018.\nNote 6-Accrued Expenses\nAccrued expenses consisted of the following:\nNote 7-Long- Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements\nLong-term debt in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets is as follows:\nThe schedule of required principal payments remaining during the next five years on long-term debt outstanding as of January 31, 2020 is as follows:\nRevolving Line of Credit\nThe Company has a $17.5 million revolving line of credit under its existing Credit Agreement with Bank of America. Revolving credit loans may be borrowed, at the Company\u2019s option, in U.S. Dollars or, subject to certain conditions, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars or Danish Kroner. Amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company\u2019s option, either (a) the LIBOR rate (or in the case of revolving credit loans denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, the applicable quoted rate), plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) a fluctuating reference rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds\u2019 rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of America\u2019s publicly announced prime rate or (iii) the LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, plus a margin that varies within a range of 0.0% to 0.5% based on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio.\nAt January 31, 2020, the Company had an outstanding balance of $6.5 million on the revolving credit line. As of January 31, 2020. the outstanding balance bore interest at a weighted average annual rate of 3.68% and $0.1 million of interest was incurred on this obligation and included in other expense in the accompanying consolidated income statement for the period ended January 31, 2020. As of January 31, 2020, there is $11.0 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility.\nThe Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility at the rate of 0.25% per annum.\nCredit Agreement\nThe Company and the Company\u2019s wholly owned Danish subsidiaries, ANI ApS and TrojanLabel ApS (collectively the \u201cParties\u201d), are parties to a credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Bank of America, N.A. The Credit Agreement and its subsequent amendments through fiscal 2019 provided for a secured credit facility consisting of a term loan to ANI ApS in the principal amount of $9.2 million, a term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million and a revolving credit facility for the Company.\nThe term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio. In connection with the Credit Agreement, AstroNova and ANI ApS entered into certain hedging arrangements with the Lender to manage the variable interest rate risk and currency risk associated with its payments in respect of the $9.2 million term loan. In connection with the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement, AstroNova entered into certain hedging arrangements with the Lender to manage the variable interest rate risk and currency exchange risk associated with its payments in respect of the $15.0 million term loan. Refer to Note 8, \u201cDerivative Financial Instruments and Risk Management\u201d for further information about these arrangements.\nThe Parties must comply with various customary financial and non-financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains limitations, in each case subject to various exceptions and thresholds, on the Company\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur future indebtedness, to place liens on assets, to conduct mergers or acquisitions, to sell assets, to alter their capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness. The Credit Agreement permits the Company to pay cash dividends on and repurchase shares of its common stock, subject to certain limitations.\nThe Lender is entitled to accelerate repayment of the loans and to terminate its revolving credit commitment under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of any of various customary events of default, which include, among other events, the following: failure to pay when due any principal, interest or other amounts in respect of the loans, breach of any of the Company\u2019s covenants or representations under the loan documents, default under any other of the Company\u2019s or its subsidiaries\u2019 significant indebtedness agreements, a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, a significant unsatisfied judgment against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or a change of control of the Company.\nThe obligations of ANI ApS in respect of the $9.2 million term loan are guaranteed by the Company and TrojanLabel ApS. The Company\u2019s obligations in respect of the $15.0 million term loan, revolving credit facility and its guarantee in respect of the ANI ApS term loan are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company (including a pledge of a portion of the equity interests held by the Company in ANI ApS and the Company\u2019s wholly-owned German subsidiary AstroNova GmbH), subject to certain exceptions.\nOn December 9, 2019, the Parties entered into a Fourth Amendment (the \u201cFourth Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate amount available for borrowings under the revolving line of credit from $10.0 million to $17.5 million through the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and (ii) modify the financial covenants with which the Company must comply thereunder by excluding certain capital expenditures from the calculation of the Company\u2019s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, providing that the minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenant will be suspended through the second quarter of fiscal 2021, and adding a minimum consolidated EBITDA covenant commencing with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and continuing through the second quarter of fiscal 2021. As of January 31, 2020, the Company believes it is in compliance with all of the covenants in the Credit Agreement.\nNote 8-Derivative Financial Instruments and Risk Management\nThe Company has entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap to manage the interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the floating-rate foreign currency-denominated term loan borrowing by our Danish Subsidiary and an interest rate swap to manage the interest rate risk associated with the variable rate term loan borrowing by the Company. Both swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of floating-rate borrowings and are recorded at fair value.\nThe cross-currency interest rate swap agreement utilized by the Company effectively modifies the Company\u2019s exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk by converting the Company\u2019s floating-rate debt denominated in U.S. Dollars on our Danish subsidiary\u2019s books to a fixed-rate debt denominated in Danish Kroner for the term of the loan, thus reducing the impact of interest-rate and foreign currency exchange rate changes on future interest expense and principal repayments. This swap involves the receipt of\nfloating rate amounts in U.S. Dollars in exchange for fixed-rate interest payments in Danish Kroner, as well as exchanges of principal at the inception spot rate, over the life of the term loan.\nThe interest rate swap agreement utilized by the Company on the term loan effectively modifies the Company\u2019s exposure to interest rate risk by converting the Company\u2019s floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt for the next five years, thus reducing the impact of interest-rate changes on future interest expense. This swap involves the receipt of floating rate amounts in U.S. dollars in exchange for fixed rate payments in U.S. dollars over the life of the term loan.\nThe following table summarizes the notional amount and fair value of the Company\u2019s derivative instrument:\nThe following tables present the impact of the derivative instruments in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019:\nAt January 31, 2020, the Company expects to reclassify approximately $0.1 million of net gains on the swap contracts from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings during the next 12 months due to changes in foreign exchange rates and the payment of variable interest associated with the floating-rate debt.\nNote 9-Royalty Obligation\nIn fiscal 2018, AstroNova, Inc. entered into an Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Honeywell International, Inc. to acquire an exclusive, perpetual, world-wide license to manufacture Honeywell\u2019s narrow-format flight deck printers for two aircraft families along with certain inventory used in the manufacturing of the licensed printers. The purchase price included a guaranteed minimum royalty payment of $15.0 million, to be paid in quarterly installments over a ten year period. Royalty payments are based on gross revenues from the sales of the printers, paper and repair services of the licensed products. The royalty rates vary based on the year in which they are paid or earned and product sold or service provided, and range from single-digit to mid double-digit percentages of gross revenue.\nThe guaranteed minimum royalty payment obligation was recorded at the present value of the minimum annual royalty payments using a present value factor of 2.8%, which is based on the estimated after-tax cost of debt for similar companies. As of January 31, 2020, the Company had paid an aggregate of $3.5 million of the guaranteed minimum royalty obligation. At January 31, 2020, the current portion of the outstanding guaranteed minimum royalty obligation of $2.0 million is to be paid over the next twelve months and is reported as a current liability and the remainder of $8.0 million is reported as a long-term liability on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. In addition to the guaranteed minimum royalty payments, for the periods ended January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, the Company also incurred excess royalty expense of $1.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively, which is included in cost of revenue in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of income. A total of $0.8 million of excess royalty is payable and reported as a current liability on the Company\u2019s condensed consolidated balance sheet at January 31, 2020.\nNote 10-Leases\nThe Company enters into lease contracts for certain of its facilities at various locations worldwide. Our leases have remaining lease terms of one to eight years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for periods of up to five years when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise such options.\nThe company leases office space from an affiliate. This lease is classified as an operating lease with annual rental payments of approximately $63,000 and $61,000 as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nBalance sheet and other information related to our leases is as follows:\nLease cost information is as follows:\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities are as follows:\nAs of January 31, 2020, the weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for our operating leases are 5.6 years and 3.96%, respectively. We calculated the weighted-average discount rate using incremental borrowing rates, which equal the rates of interest that we would pay to borrow funds on a fully collateralized basis over a similar term.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows:\nNote 11-Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe changes in the balance of accumulated other comprehensive loss by component are as follows:\nThe amounts presented above in other comprehensive income (loss) are net of taxes except for translation adjustments associated with our German and Danish subsidiaries.\nNote 12-Shareholders\u2019 Equity\nDuring fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, certain of the Company\u2019s employees delivered a total of 20,329, 33,430 and 26,561 shares, respectively, of the Company\u2019s common stock to satisfy the exercise price and related taxes for stock options exercised and restricted stock vesting. The shares delivered were valued at a total of $0.5 million, $0.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively, and are included in treasury stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. These transactions did not impact the number of shares authorized for repurchase under the Company\u2019s current repurchase program.\nNote 13-Share-Based Compensation\nThe Company maintains the following share-based compensation plans:\nStock Plans:\nWe have one equity incentive plan from which we are authorized to grant equity awards, the AstroNova, Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2018 Plan\u201d). The 2018 Plan provides for, among other things, the issuance of awards, including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, time-based restricted stock units (RSUs), performance-based restricted stock units (PSUs)and restricted stock awards (RSAs). At our annual meeting of shareholders held on June 4, 2019, the 2018 Plan was amended to increase the number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock available for issuance by 300,000, bringing the total number of shares available for issuance under the 2018 Plan from 650,000 to 950,000, plus an additional number of shares equal to the number of shares subject to awards granted under the 2018 Plan or our 2015 Equity Incentive\nPlan (the \u201c2015 Plan\u201d) that are forfeited, cancelled, satisfied without the issuance of stock, otherwise terminated (other than by exercise), or, for shares of stock issued pursuant to any unvested award, reacquired by the Company at not more than the grantee\u2019s purchase price (other than by exercise). Under the 2018 Plan, all awards to employees generally have a minimum vesting period of one year. Options granted under the 2018 Plan must be issued at an exercise price of not less than the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant and expire after ten years. As of January 31, 2020, 110,909 unvested shares of restricted stock and options to purchase an aggregate of 138,999 shares were outstanding under the 2018 Plan.\nIn addition to the 2018 Plan, we previously granted equity awards under the 2015 Plan and our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2007 Plan\u201d). No new awards may be issued under the 2015 Plan or the 2007 Plan, but outstanding awards will continue to be governed by those plans. As of January 31, 2020, 1,007 unvested shares of restricted stock and options to purchase an aggregate of 373,345 shares were outstanding under the 2007 Plan and 22,718 unvested shares of restricted stock and options to purchase an aggregate of 166,700 shares were outstanding under the 2015 Plan.\nOn January 31, 2019, the compensation committee of the Company\u2019s board of directors adopted an Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Annual Compensation Program (the \u201cNew Program\u201d), which became effective as of February 1, 2019. Pursuant to the New Program, beginning with fiscal 2020, each non-employee director automatically receives a grant of restricted stock on the date of their re-election to the Company\u2019s board of directors. The number of whole shares to be granted equals the number calculated by dividing the stock component of the director compensation amount determined by the compensation committee for that year by the fair market value of our stock on that day. The value of the restricted stock award for fiscal 2020 was $60,000. To account for the partial year beginning on February 1, 2019 and continuing through the 2019 annual meeting and thereby provide for the alignment of the timing of annual grants of restricted stock under the New Program with the election of directors at the annual meeting, on February 1, 2019, each non-employee director was granted shares of restricted stock with a fair market value of $18,000. Other than the shares granted on February 1, 2019, which vested on June 1, 2019, shares of restricted stock granted under the New Program will become vested on the first anniversary of the date of grant, conditioned upon the recipient\u2019s continued service on the Board through that date.\nShare-Based Compensation:\nShare-based compensation expense has been recognized as follows:\nStock Options:\nAggregated information regarding stock options granted under the plans is summarized below:\nSet forth below is a summary of options outstanding at January 31, 2020:\nThe fair value of each stock option granted was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:\nNo options were granted during fiscal 2020. The weighted-average estimated fair value of options granted during fiscal 2019 and 2018 was $7.43 and $4.79, respectively. As of January 31, 2020, there was $0.8 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested stock options granted under the plans. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.\nAs of January 31, 2020, the aggregate intrinsic value (the aggregate difference between the closing stock price of the Company\u2019s common stock on January 31, 2020, and the exercise price of the outstanding options)\nthat would have been received by the option holders if all options had been exercised was $0.3 million for all exercisable options and $0.3 million for all options outstanding. The total aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $0.5 million, $1.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) and Restricted Stock Awards (RSAs):\nAggregated information regarding RSUs and RSAs granted under the Plan is summarized below:\nAs of January 31, 2020, there was $1.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs and RSAs. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.0 years.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP):\nAstroNova\u2019s ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at a 15% discount from fair market value on the date of purchase. A total of 247,500 shares were initially reserved for issuance under this plan. Summarized plan activity is as follows:\nNote 14-Income Taxes\nThe components of income (loss) before income taxes are as follows:\nThe components of the (benefit) provision for income taxes are as follows:\nTotal income tax (benefit)/provision differs from the expected tax (benefit)/provision as a result of the following:\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2020 was (28.4)% compared to 21.6% in 2019 and 36.3% in 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2020 from 2019 is primarily related to lower pre-tax income in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018. Specific items decreasing the effective tax rate include foreign derived intangible income (\u201cFDII\u201d), the release of ASC 740 liabilities, R&D credit utilization, and return to provision adjustments. This decrease was offset by valuation allowances recorded on unbenefited losses in China and on carryforward foreign tax credits expected to expire unused.\nThe decrease in the effective tax rate for 2019 as compared to 2018 is primarily related to impacts of the Tax Act including the reduction in the statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% along with the absence of the one-time U.S. deferred remeasurement and Transition Tax charges. This decrease was offset by the absence of R&D\ncredits from amended tax returns and the absence of the non-taxable TrojanLabel earn out liability adjustment in TrojanLabel ApS impacting the fiscal 2018 effective tax rate.\nThe components of deferred income tax expense arise from various temporary differences and relate to items included in the statement of income. The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nThe valuation allowance of $1.8 million at January 31, 2020 and $1.3 million at January 31, 2019 related to domestic research and development tax credit carryforwards, foreign tax credit carryforwards, and net operating loss carryforwards in China, all of which are expected to expire unused. The valuation allowance increased $0.5 million in 2020 due to the generation of domestic research and development credits, and foreign tax credits in excess of the Company\u2019s ability to currently utilize them. The Company also recorded a full valuation allowance against the carryforward net operating losses in China, as the future realization is not reasonably assured. The Company has reached these conclusions after considering the availability of taxable income in prior carryback years, tax planning strategies, and the likelihood of future taxable income and credits exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards in the relevant jurisdictions.\nWe believe that it is reasonably possible that some unrecognized tax benefits, accrued interest and penalties could decrease income tax expense in the next year due to either the review of previously filed tax returns or the expiration of certain statutes of limitation. The changes in the balances of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties are as follows:\nDuring fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $114,000 of income and $8,000 and $24,000 of expense in 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to a change in interest and penalties, which are included as a component of income tax expense in the accompanying statements of income. The Company has accrued potential interest and penalties of $0.3 million and $0.5 million at the end of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in U.S. federal jurisdictions, various state jurisdictions, and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company was previously under audit by the IRS for the tax years ended January 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017. On June 6, 2019, the Company received formal communication regarding the close of the audit with no additional changes made by the IRS. Therefore, the Company\u2019s reserves for federal uncertain tax positions relating to the years in question have been released. The Company released $232,000 relating to the federal tax exposure for the years previously under audit and $74,000 of related interest (net of federal benefit) and penalties.\nThe Company was also notified of an income tax audit from the state of Rhode Island, but, no significant items have been raised at this time other than information requests. No assessments have been made as of January 31, 2020.\nU.S. income taxes have not been provided on $4.9 million of undistributed earnings of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries since it is the Company\u2019s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings offshore. If the earnings were distributed in the form of dividends, the Company would not be subject to U.S. tax as a result of the Tax Act but could be subject to foreign income and withholding taxes. Determination of the amount of this unrecognized deferred income tax liability is not practical.\nNote 15-Nature of Operations, Segment Reporting and Geographical Information\nThe Company\u2019s operations consist of the design, development, manufacture and sale of specialty printers and data acquisition and analysis systems, including both hardware and software and related consumable supplies. The Company organizes and manages its business as a portfolio of products and services designed around a common theme of data acquisition and information output. The Company has two reporting segments consistent with its revenue product groups: Product Identification (\u201cPI\u201d) and Test & Measurement (\u201cT&M\u201d).\nThe PI segment produces an array of high-technology digital color and monochrome label printers and mini presses, labeling software and supplies for a variety of commercial industries worldwide. AstroNova\u2019s T&M segment produces data acquisition systems used worldwide for a variety of recording, monitoring and troubleshooting applications for many industries including aerospace, automotive, defense, rail, energy, industrial and general manufacturing. The T&M segment also includes the Company\u2019s line of aerospace flight deck and cockpit printers.\nBusiness is conducted in the United States and through foreign branch offices and subsidiaries in Canada, Europe, China, Southeast Asia and Mexico. Manufacturing activities are primarily conducted in the United States. Revenue and service activities outside the United States are conducted through wholly-owned entities\nand, to a lesser extent, through authorized distributors and agents. Transfer prices are intended to produce gross profit margins as would be associated with an arms-length transaction.\nThe accounting policies of the reporting segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies herein. The Company evaluates segment performance based on the segment profit before corporate and financial administration expenses.\nSummarized below are the revenue and segment operating profit (both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue) for each reporting segment:\nNo customer accounted for greater than 10% of net revenue in fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nOther information by segment is presented below:\n* Corporate assets consist principally of cash, cash equivalents and securities available for sale.\nGeographical Data\nPresented below is selected financial information by geographic area:\n* Long-lived assets exclude goodwill assigned to the T&M segment of $4.5 million at both January 31, 2020 and 2019 and $7.5 million and $7.8 million assigned to the PI segment at January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNote 16-Employee Benefit Plans\nAstroNova sponsors a Profit-Sharing Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d) which provides retirement benefits to all eligible domestic employees. The Plan allows participants to defer a portion of their cash compensation and contribute such deferral to the Plan through payroll deductions. The Company makes matching contributions up to specified levels. The deferrals are made within the limits prescribed by Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nAll contributions are deposited into trust funds. It is the policy of the Company to fund any contributions accrued. The Company\u2019s annual contribution amounts are determined by the Board of Directors. Contributions paid or accrued amounted to $0.5 million in each year in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nNote 17-Product Warranty Liability\nAstroNova offers a manufacturer\u2019s warranty for the majority of its hardware products. The specific terms and conditions of warranty vary depending upon the products sold and country in which the Company does business. The Company estimates the warranty costs based on historical claims experience and records a liability in the amount of such estimates at the time product revenue is recognized. The Company regularly assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary. Activity in the product warranty liability, which is included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, is as follows:\nNote 18-Concentration of Risk\nCredit is generally extended on an uncollateralized basis to almost all customers after review of credit worthiness. Concentration of credit and geographic risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to the large number and general dispersion of accounts which constitute the Company\u2019s customer base. The Company periodically performs on-going credit evaluations of its customers. The Company has not historically experienced significant credit losses on collection of its accounts receivable.\nDuring the years ended January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, one vendor accounted for 21.2%, 21.6% and 31.3% of purchases, and 28.0%, 28.7% and 26.6% of accounts payable, respectively, as of January 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nNote 19-Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to contingencies, including legal proceedings and claims arising in the normal course of business that cover a wide range of matters including, among others, contract and employment claims; workers compensation claims; product liability; warranty and modification; and adjustment or replacement of component parts of units sold.\nDirect costs associated with the estimated resolution of contingencies are accrued at the earliest date at which it is deemed probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. While it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to contingent liabilities, including lawsuits, we believe that the aggregate amount of such liabilities, if any, in excess of amounts provided or covered by insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular future period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies or changes out of the Company\u2019s control.\nNote 20-Fair Value Measurements\nAssets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following tables provide a summary of the financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value:\nWe use the market approach to measure fair value of our derivative instruments. These derivative instruments were measured at fair value using readily observable market inputs, such as quotations on interest rates and foreign exchange rates and are classified as Level 2 because they are over-the-counter contracts with a bank counterparty that are not traded in an active market.\nThe fair value of the earn out liability incurred in connection with the Company\u2019s 2017 acquisition of TrojanLabel was determined using the option approach methodology which includes using significant inputs that are not observable in the market and therefore classified as Level 3. Key assumptions in estimating the initial fair\nvalue of the contingent consideration liability included (1) the estimated earnout targets over the next seven years of $0.5 million-$1.4 million, (2) the probability of success (achievement of the various contingent events) from 0.0%-0.9% and (3) a risk-adjusted discount rate of approximately 2.68%-4.9% used to adjust the probability-weighted earnout payments to their present value. At each reporting period, the contingent consideration liability is recorded at its fair value with changes reflected in general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nAssets and Liabilities Not Recorded at Fair Value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nThe Company\u2019s long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt not reflected in the financial statements at fair value, is reflected in the table below:\nThe fair value of the Company\u2019s long-term debt, including the current portion, is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar borrowings with the same maturities would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and is classified as Level 3.\nNote 21-Subsequent Event\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that COVID-19, a respiratory illness, caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in China, is a pandemic. COVID-19 has spread to many of the countries in which we, our customers, our suppliers and our other business partners conduct business. Governments in affected regions have implemented, and may continue to implement, safety precautions which include quarantines, travel restrictions, business closures, cancellations of public gatherings and other measures as they deem necessary. Many organizations and individuals, including the Company and its employees are taking additional steps to avoid or reduce infection, including limiting travel and staying home from work. These measures are disrupting normal business operations both in and outside of affected areas and have had significant negative impacts on businesses and financial markets worldwide.\nThe Company continues to monitor its operations and government recommendations and has made modifications to its normal operations because of the COVID-19 outbreak, including requiring most of its non-production related team members to work remotely. The Company has maintained a substantial portion of its manufacturing operational capacity at its primary manufacturing facility located at West Warwick, Rhode Island, as well as its manufacturing facilities in Canada and Germany, at this time, and has instituted heightened cleaning and sanitization standards and several health and safety protocols and procedures to safeguard its team members.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has caused the Company to experience a number of adverse impacts, including reductions in demand for its products, delays and cancellations of orders for its products, difficulties in obtaining raw materials and components for its products, shortages of labor to manufacture products, inefficiencies caused by remote worker\u2019s difficulties in performing their normal work outputs, closures of the facilities of some of its suppliers and customers, and delays in collecting accounts receivable. Disruptions in the capital markets as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak may also adversely affect the Company if these impacts continue for a prolonged period and the Company needs additional liquidity.\nThe rapid development and uncertainty of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company\u2019s business. However, COVID-19\nand the measures taken to contain it present material uncertainty and risk with respect to the Company\u2019s performance and financial results. In particular, the aerospace industry, which the Company serves through its aerospace printer product line, has been significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 outbreak, both inside and outside of the United States. The decline in air travel and the impact of that decline on demand for the Company\u2019s products from its airplane manufacturing customers, the airlines to which it sells directly and through the manufacturers, and the repair and overhaul market and the market for the paper consumed in the printers, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nIn April 2020, the Company applied for a loan in the amount of approximately $4.4 million from Bank of America, N.A. pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program administered by the United States Small Business Administration and authorized by the Keeping American Workers Employed and Paid Act, which is part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, enacted on March 27, 2020. There can be no assurance that the Company will receive any or all of the requested loan proceeds under this program.\nSUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nQuarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)\nAnnual totals may not agree to the summation of quarterly information due to insignificant rounding and the required calculation conventions.\n(1) The first quarter of fiscal 2019 includes (a) income of $1.0 million ($0.8 million net of tax or $0.12 per diluted share) for a change in accounting estimate for product costs and operating expenses related to the Honeywell TSA and (b) income of $0.4 million ($0.3 million net of tax or $0.05 per diluted share) for change in accounting estimates for revenue subject to customer rebates under the Honeywell Agreement. Both changes in accounting estimates were the result of actual amounts billed and received differing from initial estimates.\n(2) The fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 includes $0.1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, of tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Act.\n(3) Certain amounts reported in the prior quarters have been reclassified to conform to the Company\u2019s current presentation at year-end.\nASTRONOVA, INC.\nSCHEDULE II-VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS AND RESERVES\n(1) The allowance for doubtful accounts has been netted against accounts receivable in the balance sheets as of the respective balance sheet dates.\n(2) Uncollectible accounts written off, net of recoveries."
