    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following are some of the important factors that could affect our financial performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or expectations contained in our forward-looking statements. We may encounter risks in addition to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also impair or adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and prospects.\nRisk Factor Summary\nEach of the risk factors outlined below are discussed more fully following this summary:\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Matters\nOur operating results, cash flows and/or liquidity could be adversely affected by the following factors:\n\u2022Our existing level of cash resources and significant debt\n\u2022History of net losses and negative operating cash flow\n\u2022Dilution of our proportionate indirect interests in our assets, business operations and proposed projects from sale of equity or equity-related securities\n\u2022Stockholder dilution upon the conversion of our convertible notes\n\u2022Failure to perform by our customers under their long-term contracts with us\n\u2022Termination of our customer contracts under certain circumstances\n\u2022Restrictions in distributions under certain circumstances by our subsidiaries\n\u2022Restrictions in agreements governing us and our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness\n\u2022Use of hedging arrangements\n\u2022Certain rules and regulations could adversely affect our ability to hedge risks\nRisks Relating to Our LNG Terminal Operations and Commercialization\nThe operations of our LNG terminals, construction of the remaining or additional Trains and the commercialization of the LNG produced could be adversely affected by the following factors:\n\u2022Cost overruns and delays in construction, as well as difficulties in obtaining sufficient financing to pay for such costs and delays\n\u2022Our ability to obtain additional funding for additional Trains\n\u2022Hurricanes or other disasters\n\u2022Failure to obtain and maintain approvals and permits from governmental and regulatory agencies\n\u2022Delays in construction leading to reduced revenues or termination of one or more of the SPAs by our customers\n\u2022Dependency on Bechtel and other contractors\n\u2022Unavailability of third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities to transport natural gas\n\u2022Inability to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient natural gas to satisfy our delivery obligations under the SPAs\n\u2022Subjectivity to FERC regulation\n\u2022Pipeline safety integrity programs and repairs\n\u2022Reduction in the capacity of, or the allocations to, interconnecting third-party pipelines\n\u2022Loss of our right to situate our pipelines on property owned by third parties\n\u2022Inaccurate estimates for the future capacity ratings and performance capabilities of the Liquefaction Projects\n\u2022Failure by any significant customer to perform under agreements\n\u2022Inability to contract with customers to sell LNG produced in excess of quantities committed under third-party SPAs\nRisks Relating to Our LNG Business in General\nThe operation or growth of our LNG business, including our customers, could be adversely affected by the following factors:\n\u2022Not constructing or operating all of our proposed or additional LNG facilities or Trains beyond those currently planned\n\u2022Cyclical or other changes in the demand for and price of LNG and natural gas\n\u2022Failure of imported or exported LNG to be a competitive source of energy for the United States or international markets\n\u2022Various economic and political factors\n\u2022Impediments to the transport of LNG, such as shortages of LNG vessels, or operational impacts on LNG shipping\n\u2022Security of firm pipeline transportation capacity on economic terms that is sufficient to meet our feed gas transportation requirements\n\u2022Competition based upon the international market price for LNG\n\u2022Terrorist attacks, cyber incidents or military campaigns\nRisks Relating to Our Business in General\nOur operations and business results could also be adversely affected by the following factors:\n\u2022COVID-19 global pandemic and volatility in the energy markets\n\u2022Outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, at one or more of our facilities\n\u2022Significant construction and operating hazards and uninsured risks\n\u2022Existing and future environmental and similar laws and governmental regulations\n\u2022Major health and safety incident relating to our business\n\u2022Increased labor costs, and the unavailability of skilled workers or our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel, including changes in our senior management or other key personnel\n\u2022Lack of diversification\n\u2022Impairments to goodwill or long-lived assets\n\u2022Success of our share repurchase program\n\u2022Fluctuation in the market price of our common stock\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Matters\nOur existing level of cash resources and significant debt could cause us to have inadequate liquidity and could materially and adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $449 million of current restricted cash, $1,126 million of available commitments under the $1.25 billion Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility (\u201cCheniere Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), $372 million of available commitments under the $2.62 billion delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the \u201cCheniere Term Loan Facility\u201d), $767 million of available commitments under the $1.2 billion CCH Working Capital Facility (\u201cCCH Working Capital Facility\u201d), $750 million of available commitments under Cheniere Partners\u2019 credit facilities, $787 million of available commitments under the $1.2 billion Amended and Restated SPL Working Capital Facility (\u201c2015 SPL Working Capital Facility\u201d), and $31.5 billion of total debt outstanding on a consolidated basis (before unamortized premium, discount and debt issuance costs), excluding $0.8 billion aggregate outstanding letters of credit and noting that borrowings under certain of our credit facilities may be restricted. We incur, and will incur, significant interest expense relating to the assets at the Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi LNG terminals, and we anticipate needing to incur additional debt to finance the construction of Corpus Christi Stage 3. Our ability to fund our capital expenditures and refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to access additional project financing as well as the debt and equity capital markets. A variety of factors beyond our control could impact the availability or cost of capital, including domestic or international economic conditions, increases in\nkey benchmark interest rates and/or credit spreads, the adoption of new or amended banking or capital market laws or regulations and the repricing of market risks and volatility in capital and financial markets. Our financing costs could increase or future borrowings or equity offerings may be unavailable to us or unsuccessful, which could cause us to be unable to pay or refinance our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We also rely on borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our capital expenditures. If any of the lenders in the syndicates backing these facilities was unable to perform on its commitments, we may need to seek replacement financing, which may not be available as needed, or may be available in more limited amounts or on more expensive or otherwise unfavorable terms.\nWe have not always been profitable historically. We may not be able to achieve sustained profitability or generate positive operating cash flow in the future.\nWe had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as well as net losses attributable to common stockholders in prior years. In the future, we may incur operating losses and experience negative operating cash flow. We may not be able to reduce costs, increase revenues or reduce our debt service obligations sufficiently to maintain our cash resources, which could cause us to have inadequate liquidity to continue our business.\nWe will continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures while we develop and construct the Liquefaction Projects, Corpus Christi Stage 3 and other projects. Any delays beyond the expected development period for these projects could cause operating losses and negative operating cash flows. Our future liquidity may also be affected by the timing of construction financing availability in relation to the incurrence of construction costs and other outflows and by the timing of receipt of cash flows under third-party agreements in relation to the incurrence of project and operating expenses. Moreover, many factors (including factors beyond our control) could result in a disparity between liquidity sources and cash needs, including factors such as construction delays and breaches of agreements. Our ability to generate any significant positive operating cash flow and achieve profitability in the future is dependent on our ability to successfully and timely complete and operate the applicable project.\nWe may sell equity or equity-related securities or assets, including equity interests in Cheniere Partners. Such sales could dilute our proportionate interests in our assets, business operations and proposed projects of Cheniere Partners or other subsidiaries, and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have historically pursued a number of alternatives in order to finance the construction of our Trains, including potential issuances and sales of additional equity or equity-related securities by our subsidiaries. Such sales, in one or more transactions, could dilute our proportionate indirect interests in our assets, business operations and proposed projects of Cheniere Partners, including the SPL Project, or in other subsidiaries or projects, including the CCL Project. In addition, such sales, or the anticipation of such sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur stockholders may experience dilution upon the conversion of our convertible notes.\nIn March 2015, we issued $625 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2045 (the \u201c2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes\u201d) to certain investors through a registered direct offering. We have the option to satisfy the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes conversion obligation with cash, common stock or a combination thereof. Prior to December 15, 2044, the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible upon the occurrence of certain conditions, and on and after such date they will become freely convertible. The 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes will become convertible into the common stock of Cheniere at an initial conversion price of $138.38 per share.\nThe conversion of some or all of the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes into shares of our common stock will dilute the ownership percentages and voting power of our existing stockholders. Based on the initial conversion price, if we elect to satisfy the entire conversion obligation of the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes with common stock, approximately 4.5 million shares of our common stock would be issued upon the conversion, assuming the notes are converted at maturity. Any sales in the public market of the shares issuable upon conversion of the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes could adversely affect the prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or the anticipated conversion of the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur ability to generate cash is substantially dependent upon the performance by customers under long-term contracts that we have entered into, and we could be materially and adversely affected if any significant customer fails to perform its contractual obligations for any reason.\nOur future results and liquidity are substantially dependent upon performance by our customers to make payments under long-term contracts. As of December 31, 2020, SPL had SPAs with eight third-party customers, CCL had SPAs with nine third-party customers and our integrated marketing function had a limited number of SPAs with third-party customers. In addition, SPLNG had TUAs with two third-party customers. We are dependent on each customer\u2019s continued willingness and ability to perform its obligations under its SPA or TUA. We are exposed to the credit risk of any guarantor of these customers\u2019 obligations under their respective agreements in the event that we must seek recourse under a guaranty. As a result of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the volatility in the energy markets, we believe we are exposed to heightened credit and performance risk of our customers. Additionally, some customers have indicated to us that COVID-19 has impacted their operations and/or may impact their operations in the future. Some of our SPA customers\u2019 primary countries of business have experienced a significant number of COVID-19 cases and/or have been subject to government imposed lockdown or quarantine measures. Although we believe that impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on LNG regasification facilities, downstream markets and broader energy demand do not constitute valid force majeure claims under our FOB LNG SPAs, if any significant customer fails to perform its obligations under its SPA or TUA, our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects could be materially and adversely affected, even if we were ultimately successful in seeking damages from that customer or its guarantor, if any, for a breach of the agreement.\nEach of our customer contracts is subject to termination under certain circumstances.\nEach of the SPAs contains various termination rights allowing our customers to terminate their SPAs, including, without limitation: (1) upon the occurrence of certain events of force majeure; (2) if we fail to make available specified scheduled cargo quantities; and (3) delays in the commencement of commercial operations. We may not be able to replace these SPAs on desirable terms, or at all, if they are terminated.\nEach of SPLNG\u2019s long-term TUAs contains various termination rights. For example, each customer may terminate its TUA if the Sabine Pass LNG terminal experiences a force majeure delay for longer than 18 months, fails to redeliver a specified amount of natural gas in accordance with the customer\u2019s redelivery nominations or fails to accept and unload a specified number of the customer\u2019s proposed LNG cargoes. SPLNG may not be able to replace these TUAs on desirable terms, or at all, if they are terminated.\nOur subsidiaries may be restricted under the terms of their indebtedness from making distributions under certain circumstances, which may limit Cheniere Partners\u2019 ability to pay or increase distributions to us or inhibit our access to cash flows from the CCL Project and could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe agreements governing our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness restrict payments that our subsidiaries can make to Cheniere Partners or us in certain events and limit the indebtedness that our subsidiaries can incur. For example, SPL is restricted from making distributions under agreements governing its indebtedness generally until, among other requirements, deposits are made into debt service reserve accounts and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25:1.00 is satisfied.\nCCH is generally restricted from making distributions under agreements governing its indebtedness until, among other requirements, the completion of the construction of Trains 1 through 3 of the CCL Project, funding of a debt service reserve account equal to six months of debt service and achieving a historical debt service coverage ratio and fixed projected debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.00.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 inability to pay distributions to Cheniere Partners or us or to incur additional indebtedness as a result of the foregoing restrictions in the agreements governing their indebtedness may inhibit Cheniere Partners\u2019 ability to pay or increase distributions to us and its other unitholders or inhibit our access to cash flows from the CCL Project, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nRestrictions in agreements governing us and our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness may prevent us and our subsidiaries from engaging in certain beneficial transactions.\nIn addition to restrictions on the ability of us, Cheniere Partners, SPL and CCH to make distributions or incur additional indebtedness, the agreements governing our indebtedness also contain various other covenants that may prevent us from engaging in beneficial transactions, including limitations on our ability to:\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022purchase, redeem or retire equity interests;\n\u2022issue preferred stock;\n\u2022sell or transfer assets;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022enter into sale and leaseback transactions.\nOur use of hedging arrangements may adversely affect our future operating results or liquidity.\nTo reduce our exposure to fluctuations in (1) changing interest rates, (2) commodity-related marketing and price risks and (3) foreign exchange volatility, we enter into derivative financial instruments, including futures, swaps and option contracts. To the extent we hedge our exposure to commodity price, interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate exposures, we forego the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates were to change favorably to our hedged position. Hedging arrangements could also expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022expected supply is less than the amount hedged or is otherwise imperfect;\n\u2022the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contractual obligations; or\n\u2022there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received.\nOur use of derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in the fair value resulting from fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices or hedged item recognized in earnings, unless they satisfy criteria for, and we elect, the normal purchases and sales exception or hedge accounting treatment. All of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify for these exceptions from fair value reporting through earnings. As a result, our quarterly and annual results are subject to significant fluctuations caused by changes in fair value, including circumstances in which there is no underlying economic impact yet realized.\nThe use of derivatives also may require the posting of cash collateral with counterparties, which can impact working capital when commodity prices, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates change.\nThe regulatory and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules adopted thereunder and other regulations, including EMIR and REMIT, could adversely affect our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and our operating results and cash flows.\nThe provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules adopted by the CFTC, the SEC and other federal regulators establishing federal regulation of the OTC derivatives market and entities like us that participate in that market may adversely affect our ability to manage certain of our risks on a cost effective basis. Such laws and regulations may also adversely affect our ability to execute our strategies with respect to hedging our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows attributable to the future sale of our LNG inventory and to price risk attributable to future purchases of natural gas to be utilized as fuel to operate our LNG terminals and to secure natural gas feedstock for our liquefaction facilities.\nAs required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC and federal banking regulators have adopted rules to require certain market participants to collect and post initial and/or variation margin with respect to uncleared swaps from their counterparties\nthat are financial end users and certain registered swap dealers and major swap participants. Although we believe we will not be required to post margin with respect to any uncleared swaps we enter into in the future, were we required to post margin as to our uncleared swaps in the future, our cost of entering into and maintaining swaps would be increased. Our counterparties that are subject to the regulations imposing the Basel III capital requirements on them may increase the cost to us of entering into swaps with them or, although not required to collect margin from us under the margin rules, contractually require us to post collateral with them in connection with such swaps in order to offset their increased capital costs or to reduce their capital costs to maintain those swaps on their balance sheets.\nEuropean and UK-specific regulations, including but not limited to EMIR, MiFID II, REMIT, MAR, FSMA and RAO, govern our trading activities and our compliance with such laws may result in increased costs and risks to the business similar to the impacts stated above with respect to the Dodd-Frank Act. The increased costs may also have an adverse impact on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects. Further, any violation of the foregoing laws and regulations could result in investigations, and possible fines and penalties, and in some scenarios, criminal offenses.\nFurther, although a trade deal (the \"Deal\") has been reached between the UK and EU following Brexit, with the terms of this deal applying as on January 1, 2021, uncertainties remain. While the UK has implemented its own versions of many key EU rules mentioned above (known as 'onshoring'), the Deal was largely focused on goods, not services. Financial services will be negotiated separately, with an initial deadline for agreement set for March 2021. Depending on the terms of this agreement, and the extent to which the UK chooses to diverge from existing EU rules, mutual equivalence decisions could be granted by each side with the effect that compliance with either financial services regime is equivalent to compliance with the corresponding regime in the eyes of each jurisdictions' regulators. Until these issues are clarified, both sides have implemented temporary measures to avoid major disruption in areas like derivatives trading and clearing.\nRisks Relating to Our LNG Terminal Operations and Commercialization\nCost overruns and delays in the completion of one or more Trains, as well as difficulties in obtaining sufficient financing to pay for such costs and delays, could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nThe actual construction costs of the Trains may be significantly higher than our current estimates as a result of many factors, including change orders under existing or future EPC contracts resulting from the occurrence of certain specified events that may give our EPC contractor the right to cause us to enter into change orders or resulting from changes with which we otherwise agree. We have already experienced increased costs due to change orders. As construction progresses, we may decide or be forced to submit change orders to our contractor that could result in longer construction periods, higher construction costs or both, including change orders to comply with existing or future environmental or other regulations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting actions taken by governmental and regulatory authorities to prevent the spread of COVID-19 may cause a slow-down in the construction of one or more Trains. Our EPC contractor has advised us of voluntary proactive measures it is taking to protect employees and to mitigate risks associated with COVID-19, however, it has not indicated that there will be any changes to the project cost or schedule and is still performing its obligations under its EPC contracts. While the construction of Trains is continuing, if there were a major outbreak of COVID-19 at any construction site or the implementation of restrictions by the government that prevented construction for an extended period, we could experience significant delays in the construction of one or more Trains.\nDelays in the construction of one or more Trains beyond the estimated development periods, as well as change orders to our existing EPC contracts or any future EPC contract related to additional Trains, could increase the cost of completion beyond the amounts that we estimate, which could require us to obtain additional sources of financing to fund our operations until the applicable liquefaction project is fully constructed (which could cause further delays). Our ability to obtain financing that may be needed to provide additional funding to cover increased costs will depend, in part, on factors beyond our control. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain financing, we may have to accept terms that are disadvantageous to us or that may have a material adverse effect on our current or future business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOur ability to complete development of additional Trains will be contingent on our ability to obtain additional funding. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, we may be unable to fully execute our business strategy.\nWe will require significant additional funding to be able to commence construction of additional Trains, which we may not be able to obtain at a cost that results in positive economics, or at all. The inability to achieve acceptable funding may cause a delay in the development of additional Trains, and we may not be able to complete our business plan. Even if we are able to obtain funding, the funding may be inadequate to cover any increases in costs or delays in completion of additional Trains, which may cause a delay in the receipt of revenues projected therefrom or cause a loss of one or more future customers in the event of significant delays. As a result, any significant construction delay, whatever the cause, could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nHurricanes or other disasters could result in an interruption of our operations, a delay in the completion of our Liquefaction Projects, damage to our Liquefaction Projects and increased insurance costs, all of which could adversely affect us.\nHurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, Hurricane Ike in 2008, Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and Hurricanes Laura and Delta in 2020 caused temporary suspension in construction or operation of our Liquefaction Projects or caused minor damage to our Liquefaction Projects. In August 2020, SPL and CCL entered into an arrangement to provide the ability, in limited circumstances, to potentially fulfill commitments to LNG buyers from the other facility in the event operational conditions impact operations at either the Sabine Pass LNG terminal or the Corpus Christi terminal. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 17 TBtu was loaded at affiliate facilities pursuant to this agreement. Future storms and related storm activity and collateral effects, or other disasters such as explosions, fires, floods or accidents, could result in damage to, or interruption of operations at, the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, the Corpus Christi terminal or related infrastructure, as well as delays or cost increases in the construction and the development of the Liquefaction Projects, Corpus Christi Stage 3 or our other facilities and increase our insurance premiums. The U.S. Global Change Research Program has reported that the U.S.\u2019s energy and transportation systems are expected to be increasingly disrupted by climate change and extreme weather events. An increase in frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as storms, floods, fires and rising sea levels could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nFailure to obtain and maintain approvals and permits from governmental and regulatory agencies with respect to the design, construction and operation of our facilities, the development and operation of our pipelines and the export of LNG could impede operations and construction and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe design, construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipelines, LNG terminals, including the Liquefaction Projects, Corpus Christi Stage 3 and other facilities, and the import and export of LNG and the purchase and transportation of natural gas, are highly regulated activities. Approvals of the FERC and DOE under Section 3 and Section 7 of the NGA, as well as several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits, including several under the CAA and the CWA, are required in order to construct and operate an LNG facility and an interstate natural gas pipeline and export LNG. Although the FERC has issued orders under Section 3 of the NGA authorizing the siting, construction and operation of the six Trains and related facilities of the SPL Project, the three Trains and related facilities of the CCL Project and the seven midscale Trains and related facilities for Corpus Christi Stage 3, as well as orders under Section 7 of the NGA authorizing the construction and operation of the Creole Trail Pipeline, the Corpus Christi Pipeline and the pipeline for Corpus Christi Stage 3, the FERC orders require us to comply with certain ongoing conditions and obtain certain additional approvals in conjunction with ongoing construction and operations of our liquefaction and pipeline facilities. We will be required to obtain similar approvals and permits with respect to any expansion or modification of our liquefaction and pipeline facilities. We cannot control the outcome of the regulatory review and approval processes. Certain of these governmental permits, approvals and authorizations are or may be subject to rehearing requests, appeals and other challenges.\nAuthorizations obtained from the FERC, DOE and other federal and state regulatory agencies also contain ongoing conditions, and additional approval and permit requirements may be imposed. We do not know whether or when any such approvals or permits can be obtained, or whether any existing or potential interventions or other actions by third parties will interfere with our ability to obtain and maintain such permits or approvals. If we are unable to obtain and maintain the necessary approvals and permits, including as a result of untimely notices or filings, we may not be able to recover our investment in our projects. Additionally, government disruptions, such as a U.S. government shutdown, may delay or halt our ability to obtain and maintain necessary approvals and permits. There is no assurance that we will obtain and maintain these governmental permits, approvals and authorizations, or that we will be able to obtain them on a timely basis, and failure to\nobtain and maintain any of these permits, approvals or authorizations could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nDelays in the completion of one or more Trains could lead to reduced revenues or termination of one or more of the SPAs by our customers.\nAny delay in completion of a Train could cause a delay in the receipt of revenues projected therefrom or cause a loss of one or more customers in the event of significant delays. In particular, each of our SPAs provides that the customer may terminate that SPA if the relevant Train does not timely commence commercial operations. As a result, any significant construction delay, whatever the cause, could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe are dependent on Bechtel and other contractors for the successful completion of the Liquefaction Projects.\nTimely and cost-effective completion of the Liquefaction Projects in compliance with agreed specifications is central to our business strategy and is highly dependent on the performance of Bechtel and our other contractors under their agreements. The ability of Bechtel and our other contractors to perform successfully under their agreements is dependent on a number of factors, including their ability to:\n\u2022design and engineer each Train to operate in accordance with specifications;\n\u2022engage and retain third-party subcontractors and procure equipment and supplies;\n\u2022respond to difficulties such as equipment failure, delivery delays, schedule changes and failure to perform by subcontractors, some of which are beyond their control;\n\u2022attract, develop and retain skilled personnel, including engineers;\n\u2022post required construction bonds and comply with the terms thereof;\n\u2022manage the construction process generally, including coordinating with other contractors and regulatory agencies; and\n\u2022maintain their own financial condition, including adequate working capital.\nAlthough some agreements may provide for liquidated damages if the contractor fails to perform in the manner required with respect to certain of its obligations, the events that trigger a requirement to pay liquidated damages may delay or impair the operation of the Liquefaction Projects, and any liquidated damages that we receive may not be sufficient to cover the damages that we suffer as a result of any such delay or impairment. The obligations of Bechtel and our other contractors to pay liquidated damages under their agreements are subject to caps on liability, as set forth therein.\nFurthermore, we may have disagreements with our contractors about different elements of the construction process, which could lead to the assertion of rights and remedies under their contracts and increase the cost of the Liquefaction Projects or result in a contractor\u2019s unwillingness to perform further work on the Liquefaction Projects. If any contractor is unable or unwilling to perform according to the negotiated terms and timetable of its respective agreement for any reason or terminates its agreement, we would be required to engage a substitute contractor. This would likely result in significant project delays and increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nIf third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities are or become unavailable to transport natural gas, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide gas delivery options to our liquefaction facilities and pipelines. If the construction of new or modified pipeline connections is not completed on schedule or any pipeline connection were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, our ability to meet our SPA obligations and continue shipping natural gas from producing regions or to end markets could be restricted, thereby reducing our revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe may not be able to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient natural gas to satisfy our delivery obligations under the SPAs, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nUnder the SPAs with our customers, we are required to make available to them a specified amount of LNG at specified times. However, we may not be able to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient quantities of natural gas to satisfy those obligations, which may provide affected SPA customers with the right to terminate their SPAs. Our failure to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient quantities of natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOur interstate natural gas pipelines and their FERC gas tariffs are subject to FERC regulation.\nOur interstate natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC under the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the \u201cNGPA\u201d). The FERC regulates the purchase and transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, including the construction and operation of pipelines, the rates, terms and conditions of service and abandonment of facilities. Under the NGA, the rates charged by our interstate natural gas pipelines must be just and reasonable, and we are prohibited from unduly preferring or unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service. If we fail to comply with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders, our interstate pipelines could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nIn addition, as a natural gas market participant, should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. Under the EPAct, the FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA and the NGPA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1.3 million per day for each violation.\nPipeline safety integrity programs and repairs may impose significant costs and liabilities on us.\nThe PHMSA requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in \u201chigh consequence areas\u201d where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm. As an operator, we are required to:\n\u2022perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;\n\u2022identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a \u201chigh consequence area\u201d;\n\u2022improve data collection, integration and analysis;\n\u2022repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and\n\u2022implement preventative and mitigating actions.\nWe are required to maintain pipeline integrity testing programs that are intended to assess pipeline integrity. Any repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures. Should we fail to comply with applicable statutes and the Office of Pipeline Safety\u2019s rules and related regulations and orders, we could be subject to significant penalties and fines.\nAny reduction in the capacity of, or the allocations to, interconnecting, third-party pipelines could cause a reduction of volumes transported in our pipelines, which would adversely affect our revenues and cash flow.\nWe are dependent upon third-party pipelines and other facilities to provide delivery options to and from our pipelines. If any pipeline connection were to become unavailable for volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, our ability to continue shipping natural gas to end markets could be restricted, thereby reducing our revenues. Any permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect which causes a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected if we lose the right to situate our pipelines on property owned by third parties.\nWe do not own the land on which our pipelines are situated, and we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use rights. If we were to lose these rights or be required to relocate our pipelines, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are relying on estimates for the future capacity ratings and performance capabilities of the Liquefaction Projects, and these estimates may prove to be inaccurate.\nWe are relying on third parties, principally Bechtel, for the design and engineering services underlying our estimates of the future capacity ratings and performance capabilities of the Liquefaction Projects. If any Train, when actually constructed, fails to have the capacity ratings and performance capabilities that we intend, our estimates may not be accurate. Failure of any of our Trains to achieve our intended capacity ratings and performance capabilities could prevent us from achieving the commercial start dates under our SPAs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nAny failure to perform by our counterparties under agreements may adversely affect our operating results, liquidity and access to financing.\nOur integrated marketing function involves our entering into various purchase and sale, hedging and other transactions with numerous third parties (commonly referred to as \u201ccounterparties\u201d). In such arrangements, we are exposed to the performance and credit risks of our counterparties, including the risk that one or more counterparties fails to perform its obligation to make deliveries of commodities and/or to make payments. These risks may increase during periods of commodity price volatility. Defaults by suppliers and other counterparties may adversely affect our operating results, liquidity and access to financing.\nWe may not be able to contract with customers to sell LNG produced in excess of the aggregate annual contract quantities committed to SPL\u2019s and CCL\u2019s third-party SPAs.\nWe expect to sell any LNG produced in excess of the aggregate annual contract quantity committed to SPL\u2019s and CCL\u2019s third-party SPAs through our integrated marketing function. We have, and continue to develop, a portfolio of long-, medium- and short-term SPAs to transport and unload commercial LNG cargoes to locations worldwide, which is primarily sourced by LNG produced by the Liquefaction Projects in excess of the contract quantities committed to SPL\u2019s and CCL\u2019s third party SPAs, supplemented by volume procured from other locations worldwide, as needed. Excess LNG from the Liquefaction Projects competes with other sources of LNG that are priced to indices other than Henry Hub, and any collapse in the spread between global LNG prices and the Henry Hub index could impact the ability of our integrated marketing function to profitably sell any such excess LNG. Failure to secure buyers for a sufficient amount of LNG could materially and adversely affect our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.\nRisks Relating to Our LNG Business in General\nWe may not construct or operate all of our proposed LNG facilities or Trains or any additional LNG facilities or Trains beyond those currently planned, which could limit our growth prospects.\nWe may not construct some of our proposed LNG facilities or Trains, whether due to lack of commercial interest or inability to obtain financing or otherwise. Our ability to develop additional liquefaction facilities will also depend on the availability and pricing of LNG and natural gas in North America and other places around the world. Competitors may have longer operating histories, more development experience, greater name recognition, larger staffs and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources and access to sources of natural gas and LNG than we do. If we are unable or unwilling to construct and operate additional LNG facilities, our prospects for growth will be limited.\nOur cost estimates for Trains are subject to change as a result of cost overruns, change orders under existing or future construction contracts, changes in commodity prices (particularly nickel and steel), escalating labor costs and the potential need for additional funds to be expended to maintain construction schedules. In the event we experience cost overruns, delays or\nboth, the amount of funding needed to complete a Train could exceed our available funds and result in our failure to complete such Train and thereby negatively impact our business and limit our growth prospects.\nCyclical or other changes in the demand for and price of LNG and natural gas may adversely affect our LNG business and the performance of our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and prospects.\nOur LNG business and the development of domestic LNG facilities and projects generally is based on assumptions about the future availability and price of natural gas and LNG, and the prospects for international natural gas and LNG markets. Natural gas and LNG prices have been, and are likely to continue to be, volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to one or more of the following factors:\n\u2022additions to competitive regasification capacity in North America, Europe, Asia and other markets, which could divert LNG from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and the Corpus Christi LNG terminal;\n\u2022competitive liquefaction capacity in North America;\n\u2022insufficient or oversupply of natural gas liquefaction or receiving capacity worldwide;\n\u2022insufficient LNG tanker capacity;\n\u2022weather conditions, including extreme weather events and temperature volatility resulting from climate change;\n\u2022reduced demand and lower prices for natural gas;\n\u2022increased natural gas production deliverable by pipelines, which could suppress demand for LNG;\n\u2022decreased oil and natural gas exploration activities which may decrease the production of natural gas, including as a result of any potential ban on production of natural gas through hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022cost improvements that allow competitors to offer LNG regasification services or provide natural gas liquefaction capabilities at reduced prices;\n\u2022changes in supplies of, and prices for, alternative energy sources such as coal, oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar energy, which may reduce the demand for natural gas;\n\u2022changes in regulatory, tax or other governmental policies regarding imported or exported LNG, natural gas or alternative energy sources, which may reduce the demand for imported or exported LNG and/or natural gas;\n\u2022political conditions in natural gas producing regions;\n\u2022sudden decreases in demand for LNG as a result of natural disasters or public health crises, including the occurrence of a pandemic, and other catastrophic events;\n\u2022adverse relative demand for LNG compared to other markets, which may decrease LNG imports into or exports from North America; and\n\u2022cyclical trends in general business and economic conditions that cause changes in the demand for natural gas.\nAdverse trends or developments affecting any of these factors could result in decreases in the price of LNG and/or natural gas, which could materially and adversely affect the performance of our customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and prospects.\nFailure of imported or exported LNG to be a competitive source of energy for the United States or international markets could adversely affect our customers and could materially and adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nOperations of the Liquefaction Projects are dependent upon the ability of our SPA customers to deliver LNG supplies from the United States, which is primarily dependent upon LNG being a competitive source of energy internationally. The success of our business plan is dependent, in part, on the extent to which LNG can, for significant periods and in significant volumes, be supplied from North America and delivered to international markets at a lower cost than the cost of alternative energy sources. Through the use of improved exploration technologies, additional sources of natural gas may be discovered\noutside the United States, which could increase the available supply of natural gas outside the United States and could result in natural gas in those markets being available at a lower cost than LNG exported to those markets.\nAlthough SPL has entered into arrangements to utilize up to approximately three-quarters of the regasification capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal in connection with operations of the SPL Project, operations at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal are dependent, in part, upon the ability of our TUA customers to import LNG supplies into the United States, which is primarily dependent upon LNG being a competitive source of energy in North America. In North America, due mainly to a historically abundant supply of natural gas and discoveries of substantial quantities of unconventional, or shale, natural gas, imported LNG has not developed into a significant energy source. The success of the regasification services component of our business plan is dependent, in part, on the extent to which LNG can, for significant periods and in significant volumes, be produced internationally and delivered to North America at a lower cost than the cost to produce some domestic supplies of natural gas, or other alternative energy sources. Through the use of improved exploration technologies, additional sources of natural gas have recently been and may continue to be discovered in North America, which could further increase the available supply of natural gas and could result in natural gas being available at a lower cost than imported LNG.\nPolitical instability in foreign countries that import or export natural gas, or strained relations between such countries and the United States, may also impede the willingness or ability of LNG purchasers or suppliers and merchants in such countries to import or export LNG from or to the United States. Furthermore, some foreign purchasers or suppliers of LNG may have economic or other reasons to obtain their LNG from, or direct their LNG to, non-U.S. markets or from or to our competitors\u2019 liquefaction or regasification facilities in the United States.\nIn addition to natural gas, LNG also competes with other sources of energy, including coal, oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar energy. LNG from the Liquefaction Projects also competes with other sources of LNG, including LNG that is priced to indices other than Henry Hub. Some of these sources of energy may be available at a lower cost than LNG from the Liquefaction Projects in certain markets. The cost of LNG supplies from the United States, including the Liquefaction Projects, may also be impacted by an increase in natural gas prices in the United States.\nAs a result of these and other factors, LNG may not be a competitive source of energy in the United States or internationally. The failure of LNG to be a competitive supply alternative to local natural gas, oil and other alternative energy sources in markets accessible to our customers could adversely affect the ability of our customers to deliver LNG from the United States or to the United States on a commercial basis. Any significant impediment to the ability to deliver LNG to or from the United States generally, or to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal or the Corpus Christi LNG terminal or from the Liquefaction Projects specifically, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nVarious economic and political factors could negatively affect the development, construction and operation of LNG facilities, including the Liquefaction Projects and expansion projects, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nCommercial development of an LNG facility takes a number of years, requires a substantial capital investment and may be delayed by factors such as:\n\u2022increased construction costs;\n\u2022economic downturns, increases in interest rates or other events that may affect the availability of sufficient financing for LNG projects on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022decreases in the price of LNG, which might decrease the expected returns relating to investments in LNG projects;\n\u2022the inability of project owners or operators to obtain governmental approvals to construct or operate LNG facilities;\n\u2022political unrest or local community resistance to the siting of LNG facilities due to safety, environmental or security concerns; and\n\u2022any significant explosion, spill or similar incident involving an LNG facility or LNG vessel.\nThere may be impediments to the transport of LNG, such as shortages of LNG vessels worldwide or operational impacts on LNG shipping, including maritime transportation routes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nThe construction and delivery of LNG vessels require significant capital and long construction lead times. Additionally, the availability of LNG vessels and transportation costs could be impacted to the detriment of our business and our customers because of:\n\u2022an inadequate number of shipyards constructing LNG vessels and a backlog of orders at these shipyards;\n\u2022shortages of or delays in the receipt of necessary construction materials;\n\u2022political or economic disturbances;\n\u2022changes in governmental regulations or maritime self-regulatory organizations;\n\u2022work stoppages or other labor disturbances;\n\u2022bankruptcy or other financial crisis of shipbuilders or shipowners;\n\u2022quality or engineering problems;\n\u2022disruptions to maritime transportation routes; and\n\u2022weather interference or a catastrophic event, such as a major earthquake, tsunami or fire.\nWe may not be able to secure firm pipeline transportation capacity on economic terms that is sufficient to meet our feed gas transportation requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have contracted for firm capacity for our natural gas feedstock transportation requirements for the Liquefaction Projects and for Corpus Christi Stage 3. If and when we need to replace one or more of our existing agreements with these interconnecting pipelines, we may not be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could impair our ability to fulfill our obligations under certain of our SPAs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe face competition based upon the international market price for LNG.\nOur Liquefaction Projects are subject to the risk of LNG price competition at times when we need to replace any existing SPA, whether due to natural expiration, default or otherwise, or enter into new SPAs. Factors relating to competition may prevent us from entering into a new or replacement SPA on economically comparable terms as existing SPAs, or at all. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects. Factors which may negatively affect potential demand for LNG from our Liquefaction Projects are diverse and include, among others:\n\u2022increases in worldwide LNG production capacity and availability of LNG for market supply;\n\u2022increases in demand for LNG but at levels below those required to maintain current price equilibrium with respect to supply;\n\u2022increases in the cost to supply natural gas feedstock to our Liquefaction Projects;\n\u2022decreases in the cost of competing sources of natural gas or alternate fuels such as coal, heavy fuel oil and diesel;\n\u2022decreases in the price of non-U.S. LNG, including decreases in price as a result of contracts indexed to lower oil prices;\n\u2022increases in capacity and utilization of nuclear power and related facilities; and\n\u2022displacement of LNG by pipeline natural gas or alternate fuels in locations where access to these energy sources is not currently available.\nTerrorist attacks, cyber incidents or military campaigns may adversely impact our business.\nA terrorist attack, cyber incident or military incident involving an LNG facility, our infrastructure or an LNG vessel may result in delays in, or cancellation of, construction of new LNG facilities, including one or more of the Trains, which would increase our costs and decrease our cash flows. A terrorist incident or cyber incident may also result in temporary or permanent closure of our existing facilities, which could increase our costs and decrease our cash flows, depending on the duration and timing of the closure. Our operations could also become subject to increased governmental scrutiny that may result in additional security measures at a significant incremental cost to us. In addition, the threat of terrorism and the impact of military campaigns may lead to continued volatility in prices for natural gas that could adversely affect our business and our customers, including their ability to satisfy their obligations to us under our commercial agreements. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, cyber incidents or war could also materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital. The continuation of these developments may subject our construction and our operations to increased risks, as well as increased costs, and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Business in General\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic and volatility in the energy markets may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in significant disruption globally. Actions taken by various governmental authorities, individuals and companies around the world to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have restricted travel, business operations, and the overall level of individual movement and in-person interaction across the globe. Additionally, recent disputes over production levels between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producing countries have resulted in increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices.\nThe extent, duration and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effects will depend on future developments, all of which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity, as well as actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic or any future resurgence. These developments include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rates, the demand for oil and natural gas, levels of consumer confidence and the post-pandemic pace of recovery.\nMany uncertainties remain with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation. The COVID-19 pandemic alone or coupled with continued volatility in the energy markets may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects or have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein. The extent to which our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects are affected by the COVID-19 global pandemic or volatility in the energy markets will depend on various factors beyond our control and are highly uncertain, including the duration and scope of the outbreak, decreased demand for LNG and the resulting economic effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic.\nOutbreaks of infectious diseases, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, at one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our operations.\nFederal, state and local governments have enacted various measures to try to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns. Our facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and Corpus Christi LNG terminal are critical infrastructure and have continued to operate during the outbreak, which means that we must keep our employees who operate our facilities safe and minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to the virus. In response, we have taken extra precautionary measures to protect the continued safety and welfare of our employees who continue to work at our facilities and have modified certain business and workforce practices, such as implementing work from home policies where appropriate, but there can be no assurances that these measures will prevent any outbreak. Furthermore, the measures taken to prevent an outbreak at our facilities have resulted in increased costs and it is unclear how long such increased costs will continue to be incurred. If a large number of our employees in those critical facilities were to contract COVID-19 at the same time, our operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to significant construction and operating hazards and uninsured risks, one or more of which may create significant liabilities and losses for us.\nThe construction and operation of our LNG terminals and our pipelines are, and will be, subject to the inherent risks associated with these types of operations, including explosions, breakdowns or failures of equipment, operational errors by vessel or tug operators, pollution, release of toxic substances, fires, hurricanes and adverse weather conditions and other hazards, each of which could result in significant delays in commencement or interruptions of operations and/or in damage to or destruction of our facilities or damage to persons and property. In addition, our operations and the facilities and vessels of third parties on which our operations are dependent face possible risks associated with acts of aggression or terrorism.\nWe do not, nor do we intend to, maintain insurance against all of these risks and losses. We may not be able to maintain desired or required insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nExisting and future environmental and similar laws and governmental regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating costs or construction costs and restrictions.\nOur business is and will be subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations applicable to our construction and operation activities relating to, among other things, air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health and safety. Many of these laws and regulations, such as the CAA, the Oil Pollution Act, the CWA and the RCRA, and analogous state laws and regulations, restrict or prohibit the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with the construction and operation of our facilities, and require us to maintain permits and provide governmental authorities with access to our facilities for inspection and reports related to our compliance. In addition, certain laws and regulations authorize regulators having jurisdiction over the construction and operation of our LNG terminals and pipelines, including FERC and PHMSA, to issue compliance orders, which may restrict or limit operations or increase compliance or operating costs. Violation of these laws and regulations could lead to substantial liabilities, compliance orders, fines and penalties or to capital expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects. Federal and state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct, for the release of certain types or quantities of hazardous substances into the environment. As the owner and operator of our facilities, we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances released into the environment at or from our facilities and for resulting damage to natural resources.\nIn 2009, the EPA promulgated and finalized the Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions from stationary sources in a variety of industries. In 2010, the EPA expanded the rule to include reporting obligations for LNG terminals. In addition, the EPA has defined GHG emissions thresholds that would subject GHG emissions from new and modified industrial sources to regulation if the source is subject to PSD Permit requirements due to its emissions of non-GHG criteria pollutants. While the EPA subsequently took a number of additional actions primarily relating to GHG emissions from the electric power generation and the oil and gas exploration and production industries, those rules were largely stayed or repealed during the Trump Administration including by amendments adopted by the EPA on February 23, 2018 and additional amendments to new source performance standards for the oil and gas industry on September 14 and 15, 2020. On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing the EPA to consider publishing for notice and comment a proposed rule suspending, revising, or rescinding the September 2020 rule, which could result in more stringent GHG emissions rulemaking. In addition, other federal and state initiatives may be considered in the future to address GHG emissions through, for example, United States treaty commitments, direct regulation, market-based regulations such as a carbon emissions tax or cap-and-trade programs or clean energy standards. Such initiatives could affect the demand for or cost of natural gas, which we consume at our terminals, or could increase compliance costs for our operations. We are supportive of regulations reducing GHG emissions over time.\nOther future legislation and regulations, such as those relating to the transportation and security of LNG imported to or exported from our terminals or climate policies of destination countries in relation to their obligations under the Paris Agreement or other national climate change-related policies, could cause additional expenditures, restrictions and delays in our business and to our proposed construction activities, the extent of which cannot be predicted and which may require us to limit substantially, delay or cease operations in some circumstances. Revised, reinterpreted or additional laws and regulations that\nresult in increased compliance costs or additional operating or construction costs and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nA major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damages.\nHealth and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in personal harm or injury, penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements or litigation, and a failure that results in a significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities. Such a failure could generate public concern and have a corresponding impact on our reputation and our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies and local communities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe may experience increased labor costs, and the unavailability of skilled workers or our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect us. In addition, changes in our senior management or other key personnel could affect our business results.\nWe are dependent upon the available labor pool of skilled employees. We compete with other energy companies and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to construct and operate our facilities and pipelines and to provide our customers with the highest quality service. Our affiliates who hire personnel on our behalf are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions. A shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures, changes in applicable laws and regulations or labor disputes could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and could require an increase in the wage and benefits packages that we offer, thereby increasing our operating costs. Any increase in our operating costs could materially and adversely affect our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nWe depend on our executive officers for various activities. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our personnel. Although we have arrangements relating to compensation and benefits with certain of our executive officers, we do not have any employment contracts or other agreements with key personnel other than our employment agreement with our President and Chief Executive Officer binding them to provide services for any particular term. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur lack of diversification could have an adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nSubstantially all of our anticipated revenue in 2021 will be dependent upon our two facilities, the Sabine Pass LNG terminal located in southern Louisiana and the Corpus Christi LNG terminal in Texas. Due to our lack of asset and geographic diversification, an adverse development at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal or the Corpus Christi LNG terminal, including the related pipelines, or in the LNG industry, would have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition and operating results than if we maintained more diverse assets and operating areas.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill or long-lived assets.\nWe test our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently as circumstances dictate. Significant negative industry or economic trends, including a significant decline in the market price of our common stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows for our business or disruptions to our business could lead to an impairment charge of our long-lived assets, including goodwill. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. Projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from results. In addition, if our analysis results in an impairment to our goodwill or long-lived assets, we may be required to record a charge to earnings in our Consolidated Financial Statements during a period in which such impairment is determined to exist, which may negatively impact our operating results.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nIn June 2019, our Board authorized a three-year, $1 billion share repurchase program and as of December 31, 2020, up to $596 million remains available for repurchase. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock. Our share repurchase program may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future. Our stockholders could lose all or part of their investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience volatility. For example, during the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, the market price of our common stock ranged between $27.06 and $71.03. Such fluctuations may continue as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022domestic and worldwide supply of and demand for natural gas and corresponding fluctuations in the price of natural gas;\n\u2022fluctuations in our quarterly or annual financial results or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022issuance of additional equity securities which causes further dilution to stockholders;\n\u2022sales of a high volume of shares of our common stock by our stockholders;\n\u2022operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022events affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to us;\n\u2022changes in government regulation or proposals applicable to us;\n\u2022actual or potential non-performance by any customer or a counterparty under any agreement;\n\u2022announcements made by us or our competitors of significant contracts;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022general conditions in the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022general economic conditions;\n\u2022the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial or other estimates by analysts;\n\u2022changes in investor sentiment regarding the energy industry and fossil fuels; and\n\u2022other factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIn addition, the United States securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies in these markets. Market fluctuations and broad market, economic and industry factors may negatively affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. If we were to be the object of securities class litigation as a result of volatility in our common stock price or for other reasons, it could result in substantial diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could negatively affect our financial results.",

We regularly analyze current information and, as necessary, provide accruals for probable liabilities on the eventual disposition of these matters.\nLDEQ Matter\nCertain of our subsidiaries are in discussions with the LDEQ to resolve self-reported deviations arising from operation of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and the commissioning of the SPL Project, and relating to certain requirements under its Title V Permit. The matter involves deviations self-reported to LDEQ pursuant to the Title V Permit and covering the time period from January 1, 2012 through March 25, 2016. On April 11, 2016, certain of our subsidiaries received a Consolidated Compliance Order and Notice of Potential Penalty (the \u201cCompliance Order\u201d) from LDEQ covering deviations self-reported during that time period. Certain of our subsidiaries continue to work with LDEQ to resolve the matters identified in the Compliance Order. We do not expect that any ultimate sanction will have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nPHMSA Matter\nIn February 2018, the PHMSA issued a Corrective Action Order (the \u201cCAO\u201d) to SPL in connection with a minor LNG leak from one tank and minor vapor release from a second tank at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal. These two tanks have been taken out of operational service while we conduct analysis, repair and remediation. On April 20, 2018, SPL and PHMSA executed a Consent Agreement and Order (the \u201cConsent Order\u201d) that replaces and supersedes the CAO. On July 9, 2019, PHMSA and FERC issued a joint letter setting out operating conditions required to be met prior to SPL returning the tanks to service. We continue to coordinate with PHMSA and FERC to address the matters relating to the February 2018 leak, including repair approach and related analysis.

This information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance, current financial condition and outlook for the future. Our discussion and analysis includes the following subjects:\n\u2022Overview of Business\n\u2022Overview of Significant Events\n\u2022Impact of COVID-19 and Market Environment\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022Contractual Obligations\n\u2022Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\u2022Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates\n\u2022Recent Accounting Standards\nOverview of Business\nCheniere, a Delaware corporation, is a Houston-based energy infrastructure company primarily engaged in LNG-related businesses. We provide clean, secure and affordable LNG to integrated energy companies, utilities and energy trading companies around the world. We aspire to conduct our business in a safe and responsible manner, delivering a reliable, competitive and integrated source of LNG to our customers. We own and operate the Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana, one of the largest LNG production facilities in the world, through our ownership interest in and management agreements with Cheniere Partners, which is a publicly traded limited partnership that we created in 2007. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 100% of the general partner interest and 48.6% of the limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners. We also own and operate the Corpus Christi LNG terminal in Texas, which is wholly owned by us.\nThe Sabine Pass LNG terminal is located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, on the Sabine-Neches Waterway less than four miles from the Gulf Coast. Cheniere Partners, through its subsidiary SPL, is currently operating five natural gas liquefaction Trains and is constructing one additional Train that is expected to be substantially completed in the second half of 2022, for a total production capacity of approximately 30 mtpa of LNG (the \u201cSPL Project\u201d) at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal. The Sabine Pass LNG terminal has operational regasification facilities owned by Cheniere Partners\u2019 subsidiary, SPLNG, that include pre-existing infrastructure of five LNG storage tanks with aggregate capacity of approximately 17 Bcfe, two existing marine berths and one under construction that can each accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters and vaporizers with regasification capacity of approximately 4 Bcf/d. Cheniere Partners also owns a 94-mile pipeline through its subsidiary, CTPL, that interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG terminal with a number of large interstate pipelines.\nWe also own the Corpus Christi LNG terminal near Corpus Christi, Texas, and are currently operating two Trains and one additional Train is undergoing commissioning for a total production capacity of approximately 15 mtpa of LNG. Additionally, we are operating a 23-mile natural gas supply pipeline that interconnects the Corpus Christi LNG terminal with several interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines (the \u201cCorpus Christi Pipeline\u201d and together with the Trains, the \u201cCCL Project\u201d) through our subsidiaries CCL and CCP, respectively. The CCL Project, once fully constructed, will contain three LNG storage tanks with aggregate capacity of approximately 10 Bcfe and two marine berths that can each accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters.\nWe have contracted approximately 85% of the total production capacity from the SPL Project and the CCL Project (collectively, the \u201cLiquefaction Projects\u201d) on a term basis, with approximately 18 years of average remaining life as of December 31, 2020. This includes volumes contracted under SPAs in which the customers are required to pay a fixed fee with\nrespect to the contracted volumes irrespective of their election to cancel or suspend deliveries of LNG cargoes, as well as volumes contracted under integrated production marketing (\u201cIPM\u201d) gas supply agreements.\nAdditionally, separate from the CCH Group, we are developing an expansion of the Corpus Christi LNG terminal adjacent to the CCL Project (\u201cCorpus Christi Stage 3\u201d) through our subsidiary CCL Stage III for up to seven midscale Trains with an expected total production capacity of approximately 10 mtpa of LNG. We received approval from FERC in November 2019 to site, construct and operate the expansion project.\nWe remain focused on operational excellence and customer satisfaction. Increasing demand of LNG has allowed us to expand our liquefaction infrastructure in a financially disciplined manner. We have increased available liquefaction capacity at our Liquefaction Projects as a result of debottlenecking and other optimization projects. We hold significant land positions at both the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and the Corpus Christi LNG terminal which provide opportunity for further liquefaction capacity expansion. The development of these sites or other projects, including infrastructure projects in support of natural gas supply and LNG demand, will require, among other things, acceptable commercial and financing arrangements before we can make a final investment decision (\u201cFID\u201d).\nOverview of Significant Events\nOur significant events since January 1, 2020 and through the filing date of this Form 10-K include the following:\nOperational\n\u2022As of February 19, 2021, approximately 1,425 cumulative LNG cargoes totaling over 95 million tonnes of LNG have been produced, loaded and exported from the Liquefaction Projects.\n\u2022In December 2020, CCL commenced shipment of LNG commissioning cargoes from Train 3 of the CCL Project.\nFinancial\n\u2022We completed the following financing transactions:\n\u25e6In February 2021, SPL entered into a note purchase agreement for the sale of approximately $147 million aggregate principal amount of 2.95% Senior Secured Notes due 2037 (the \u201c2.95% SPL 2037 Senior Secured Notes\u201d) on a private placement basis. The 2.95% SPL 2037 Senior Secured Notes are expected to be issued in December 2021, and the net proceeds are expected to be used to refinance a portion of SPL\u2019s outstanding Senior Secured Notes due 2022. The 2.95% SPL 2037 Senior Secured Notes will be fully amortizing, with a weighted average life of over 10 years.\n\u25e6In September 2020, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion of 4.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the \u201c2028 Cheniere Senior Secured Notes\u201d). The net proceeds were used to prepay approximately $2.0 billion of outstanding indebtedness of the Cheniere Term Loan Facility.\n\u25e6In August 2020, CCH issued an aggregate principal amount of approximately $769 million of 3.52% Senior Secured Notes due 2039 (the \u201c3.52% CCH Senior Secured Notes\u201d). The net proceeds of these notes were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under CCH\u2019s amended and restated credit facility (\u201cCCH Credit Facility\u201d), pay costs associated with certain interest rate derivative instruments that were settled and pay certain fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with these transactions.\n\u25e6In June 2020, we entered into the Cheniere Term Loan Facility with original commitments of $2.62 billion, which in July 2020 was subsequently increased to $2.695 billion. In July 2020, borrowings under the Cheniere Term Loan Facility were used to (1) redeem the remaining outstanding principal amount of the 11% Convertible Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes\u201d), subsequent to the $300 million redemption in March 2020, pursuant to the amended and restated note purchase agreement for the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes which allowed CCH HoldCo II to redeem the outstanding notes with cash at a price of $1,080 per $1,000 principal amount, (2) repurchase $844 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.875% Convertible Unsecured Notes due 2021 (the \u201c2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes\u201d) at individually negotiated prices from a small number of investors and (3) pay the related fees and expenses. The remaining available commitments under the Cheniere Term Loan Facility of $372 million are expected to be used to repay and/or repurchase a portion of\nthe remaining outstanding principal amount of the 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes and for the payment of related fees and expenses.\n\u25e6In May 2020, SPL issued an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion of 4.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2030 (the \u201c2030 SPL Senior Notes\u201d). Net proceeds of the offering, along with available cash, were used to redeem all of SPL\u2019s outstanding 5.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2021 (the \u201c2021 SPL Senior Notes\u201d).\n\u25e6In March 2020, SPL entered into a $1.2 billion Working Capital Revolving Credit and Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement (the \u201c2020 SPL Working Capital Facility\u201d), which refinanced its previous working capital facility, reduced the interest rate and extended the maturity date to March 2025.\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2020, in line with our previously announced capital allocation priorities, with available cash, we: (1) prepaid $200 million of the borrowings made during the year under the $2.695 billion delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the \u201cCheniere Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (2) redeemed $300 million of the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes.\n\u2022In December 2020, we loaded and shipped the first two LNG cargoes under the 25-year SPA with CPC Corporation, Taiwan, which were delivered in January 2021.\n\u2022In May 2020, the date of first commercial delivery was reached under the 20-year SPAs with PT Pertamina (Persero), Naturgy LNG GOM, Limited, Woodside Energy Trading Singapore Pte Ltd, Iberdrola Generaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1a, S.A.U. (assigned by Iberdrola, S.A.) and \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France, S.A. relating to Train 2 of the CCL Project.\n\u2022In February 2021, Fitch Ratings upgraded the outlook of SPL\u2019s senior secured notes rating to positive from stable.\nImpact of COVID-19 and Market Environment\nThe LNG business environment in 2020 was impacted by the coronavirus pandemic and its economic ramifications. Lockdown measures across the globe reduced economic activity and resulted in lower energy needs throughout most of the year. However, LNG demand proved relatively resilient as compared to other hydrocarbons, showing an annual gain of approximately 1.4%, or 5 MT, to 364 MT in 2020. While the economic recovery in Asia, and particularly in China, lifted LNG demand in the second half of the year, uncertainty about the pandemic\u2019s track remains the primary near-term risk to LNG trade. A slow return towards normal is expected to occur in the coming months, depending on the speed of vaccine rollout within regions, vaccine effectiveness against mutations and the speed and shape of economic recovery across the LNG importing nations. The continued improvements in global economic indicators seen in the fourth quarter is encouraging especially in China, which represents one of the key countries for LNG demand growth.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, natural gas and LNG spot prices significantly increased in line with the increase in economic activity and with seasonal norms. After falling to all-time lows in the second quarter, global LNG price benchmarks have made an impressive climb and exited the year at the highest levels since March 2019. As an example, the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (\u201cTTF\u201d), a virtual trading point for natural gas in the Netherlands, settled December at $5.08/MMBtu, $3.94/MMBtu higher than its June 2020 settlement. Similarly, the Japan Korea Marker (\u201cJKM\u201d), an LNG benchmark price assessment for spot physical cargoes delivered ex-ship into certain key markets in Asia, settled December at $6.90/MMBtu, which is $4.84/MMBtu higher than its all-time low July 2020 settlement. Record-low winter temperatures, supply outages and transportation bottlenecks contributed to drive JKM prices up to all-time highs by mid-January 2021. In a projection published in July 2020, IHS Markit estimated LNG demand to reach 383 MT in 2021, implying a return to higher growth in 2021.\nWe have limited exposure to the fluctuations in oil and LNG spot prices as we have contracted a significant portion of our LNG production capacity under long-term sale and purchase agreements linked to a Henry Hub price. For this reason, we do not expect price fluctuations to have a material impact on our forecasted financial results for 2021.\nThe number of LNG cargoes for which customers notified us that they would not take delivery has reduced from this summer, a sign that the market is continuing to adjust and rebalance toward equilibrium. We do not expect these events to have a material adverse impact on our forecasted financial results for 2021, due to the highly contracted nature of our business and the fact that customers continue to be obligated to pay fixed fees for cargoes with respect to which they have exercised their contractual right to cancel. As such, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $969 million in LNG revenues associated with LNG cargoes for which customers notified us that they would not take delivery, of which $38 million would have been recognized subsequent to December 31, 2020, if the cargoes were lifted pursuant to the delivery schedules with the\ncustomers. We experienced decreased revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020 associated with LNG cargoes that were scheduled for delivery for which customers notified us that they would not take delivery of such cargoes.\nIn addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have modified certain business and workforce practices to protect the safety and welfare of our employees who continue to work at our facilities and offices worldwide, as well as implemented certain mitigation efforts to ensure business continuity. In March 2020, we began consulting with a medical advisor, and implemented social distancing through revised shift schedules, work from home policies and designated remote work locations where appropriate, restricted non-essential business travel and began requiring self-screening for employees and contractors. In April 2020, we began providing temporary housing for our workforce for our facilities, implemented temperature testing, incorporated medical and social workers to support employees, implemented prior self-isolation and screening for temporary housing and implemented marine operations with zero contact during loading activities. These measures have resulted in increased costs. While response measures continue to evolve and in most cases have moderated or ceased, we expect to incur incremental operating costs associated with business continuity and protection of our workforce until the risks associated with the pandemic diminish. We have incurred approximately $69 million of such costs during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nResults of Operations\nThe following charts summarize the number of Trains that were in operation during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and total revenues and total LNG volumes loaded from our Liquefaction Projects (including both operational and commissioning volumes) for the respective periods:\nThe following table summarizes the volumes of operational and commissioning LNG cargoes that were loaded from the Liquefaction Projects, which were recognized on our Consolidated Financial Statements during the year ended December 31, 2020:\nOur consolidated net loss attributable to common stockholders was $85 million, or $0.34 per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of $648 million, or $2.53 per share-basic and $2.51 per share-diluted, in the year ended December 31, 2019. This $733 million decrease in net income attributable to common stockholders in 2020 was primarily attributable to increases in: (1) losses from commodity derivatives\nto secure natural gas feedstock for the Liquefaction Projects, (2) income tax provision, (3) losses on modification or extinguishment of debt, (4) operating and maintenance expense, (5) depreciation and amortization expense, (6) interest rate derivative losses and (7) interest expense, net of capitalized interest. This loss was partially offset by increased gross margins primarily due to additional LNG volume available to be sold from additional Trains that have reached substantial completion between the periods, a portion of which the customers elected not to take delivery but were required to pay a fixed fee with respect to the contracted volumes.\nOur consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders was $471 million, or $1.92 per share-basic and $1.90 per share-diluted, in the year ended December 31, 2018. This $177 million increase in net income in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to (1) increased gross margins due to increased volume of LNG sold partially offset by decreased pricing on LNG, (2) increased tax benefit from the release of a significant portion of the valuation allowance previously recorded against our deferred tax assets, (3) increased LNG revenues as a result of derivative gains on commodity derivatives and (4) decreased net income attributable to non-controlling interest, which were partially offset by an increase in (1) interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, (2) operating and maintenance expense, (3) derivative losses, net, associated with our interest rate derivatives, (4) depreciation and amortization expense and (5) losses on equity method investments.\nWe enter into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to (1) changing interest rates, (2) commodity-related marketing and price risks and (3) foreign exchange volatility. Derivative instruments are reported at fair value on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In some cases, the underlying transactions economically hedged receive accrual accounting treatment, whereby revenues and expenses are recognized only upon delivery, receipt or realization of the underlying transaction. Because the recognition of derivative instruments at fair value has the effect of recognizing gains or losses relating to future period exposure, use of derivative instruments may increase the volatility of our results of operations based on changes in market pricing, counterparty credit risk and other relevant factors.\nRevenues\n2020 vs. 2019 and 2019 vs. 2018\nTotal revenues decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 from the comparable period in 2019, primarily as a result of decreased revenues recognized by our integrated marketing function due to the recent downturn in the energy market and the absence of variable fees for cargoes in which customers notified us they would not take delivery. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $969 million in revenues associated with LNG cargoes for which customers notified us that they would not take delivery, of which $38 million would have been recognized subsequent to December 31, 2020, if the cargoes were lifted pursuant to the delivery schedules with the customers. The increase in revenue attributable to LNG volume sold during the year ended December 31, 2019 from the comparable period in 2018 was due to increased volume of LNG sold following the achievement of substantial completion of Trains between the years, partially offset by decreased LNG revenues per MMBtu, which was primarily affected by market prices realized for volumes sold by our integrated marketing function. We expect our LNG revenues to increase in the future upon Train 3 of the CCL Project and Train 6 of the SPL Project becoming operational.\nPrior to substantial completion of a Train, amounts received from the sale of commissioning cargoes from that Train are offset against LNG terminal construction-in-process, because these amounts are earned or loaded during the testing phase for the construction of that Train. During the years ended years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we realized offsets to LNG terminal costs of $19 million, $301 million and $140 million, corresponding to 3 TBtu, 51 TBtu and 17 TBtu, respectively, that were related to the sale of commissioning cargoes from the Liquefaction Projects.\nAlso included in LNG revenues are sale of unutilized natural gas procured for the liquefaction process, gains and losses from derivative instruments, which include the realized value associated with a portion of derivative instruments that settle through physical delivery, and revenues from arrangements in which we financially settled previously-scheduled LNG cargo\nsales without physical delivery. We recognized revenues of $436 million, $693 million and $163 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to these transactions.\nThe following table presents the components of LNG revenues and the corresponding LNG volumes sold:\n(1) Long-term agreements include agreements with an initial tenure of 12 months or more.\n(2) LNG revenues include revenues with no corresponding volumes due to revenues attributable to LNG cargoes for which customers notified us that they would not take delivery.\nOperating costs and expenses\n2020 vs. 2019 and 2019 vs. 2018\nOur total operating costs and expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 from the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of decreased cost of sales, partially offset by increased operating and maintenance expense and depreciation and amortization expense from additional operating Trains between the periods. Our total operating costs and expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 from the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily as a result of the increase in operating Trains between each of the periods, and further due to increased third-party service and maintenance costs from turnaround and related activities at the SPL Project.\nCost of sales includes costs incurred directly for the production and delivery of LNG from the Liquefaction Projects, to the extent those costs are not utilized for the commissioning process. Cost of sales decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 from the comparable 2019 period, primarily due to decreased pricing of natural gas feedstock between the periods and decreased vessel charter costs. Partially offsetting this decrease was decreased fair value of commodity derivatives to secure natural gas feedstock for the Liquefaction Projects due to unfavorable shifts in long-term forward prices relative to our hedged position and increases in costs associated with sale of unutilized natural gas procured for the liquefaction process and a portion of derivative instruments that settle through physical delivery. Cost of sales increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 from the year ended December 31, 2018 due to increased volume of natural gas feedstock partially offset by decreased\npricing and increased vessel charter costs. Partially offsetting this increase was increased derivative gains from an increase in fair value of the derivatives associated with economic hedges to secure natural gas feedstock for the Liquefaction Projects, primarily due to a favorable shift in long-term forward prices. Cost of sales also includes port and canal fees, variable transportation and storage costs and the sale of natural gas procured for the liquefaction process and other costs to convert natural gas into LNG.\nOperating and maintenance expense primarily includes costs associated with operating and maintaining the Liquefaction Projects. During the year ended December 31, 2020, operating and maintenance expense also included costs incurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as further described above in Impact of COVID-19 and Market Environment. Excluding the costs incurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, operating and maintenance expense (including affiliates) increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 from the comparable period in 2019, primarily due to increased natural gas transportation and storage capacity demand charges, increased TUA reservation charges due to Total Gas & Power North America, Inc. (\u201cTotal\u201d) under the partial TUA assignment agreement and increased payroll and benefit costs from increased headcount from additional Trains operating at the Liquefaction Projects between the periods. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2019 from the comparable period in 2018 was primarily related to: (1) increased natural gas transportation and storage capacity demand charges from operating Train 5 of the SPL Project and Trains 1 and 2 of the CCL Project following the respective substantial completions, (2) increased cost of turnaround and related activities at the SPL Project, (3) increased TUA reservation charges paid to Total from payments under the partial TUA assignment agreement and (4) increased payroll and benefit costs from increased headcount to operate Train 5 of the SPL Project and Trains 1 and 2 of the CCL Project. Operating and maintenance expense also includes insurance and regulatory and other operating costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased during each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as a result of an increased number of operational Trains, as the related assets began depreciating upon reaching substantial completion.\nImpairment expense and loss on disposal of assets decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The higher impairment expense and loss on disposal of assets recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily related to the write down of assets used in non-core operations outside of our liquefaction activities, including losses from uncollectible notes receivable.\nWe expect our operating costs and expenses to generally increase in the future upon Train 3 of the CCL Project and Train 6 of the SPL Project achieving substantial completion, although we expect certain costs will not proportionally increase with the number of operational Trains as cost efficiencies will be realized.\nOther income (expense)\n2020 vs. 2019 and 2019 vs. 2018\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 from the comparable 2019 and 2018 periods as a result of a decrease in the portion of total interest costs that is eligible for capitalization as additional Trains of the Liquefaction Projects completed construction between the periods. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we incurred $1.8 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion of total interest cost, respectively, of which we capitalized $248 million, $414 million and $803 million, respectively, which was primarily related to interest costs incurred for the construction of the Liquefaction Projects.\nLoss on modification or extinguishment of debt increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 from the comparable periods in 2019 and 2018. The loss on modification or extinguishment of debt in each of the years included the incurrence of fees paid to lenders, third party fees and write off of unamortized debt issuance costs recognized upon the redemption and repurchase of convertible senior notes, refinancing our credit facilities with senior notes, refinancing of senior\nnotes, prepayment of the outstanding indebtedness of our term loan facility and paydown of our credit facilities as part of the capital allocation framework.\nInterest rate derivative loss, net increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the comparable 2019 and 2018 periods, primarily due to an unfavorable shift in the long-term forward LIBOR curve between the periods.\nOther expense, net increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 from the comparable periods in 2019 and 2018, due to an impairment loss recognized related to our equity method investments. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized other-than-temporary impairment losses of $129 million related to our investment in Midship Holdings, LLC (\u201cMidship Holdings\u201d) which was precipitated primarily due to declining market conditions in the energy industry and customer credit risk, resulting in a reduction in the fair value of our equity interests. We recognized losses of $87 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to our investments in certain equity method investees, including Midship Holdings. Impairments were primarily the result of cost overruns and extended construction timelines for operating infrastructure of our investees\u2019 projects, resulting in a reduction of the expected fair value of our equity interests. In each of the years, these impairment losses were partially offset by interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.\nIncome tax benefit (provision)\n2020 vs. 2019 and 2019 vs. 2018\nThe effective tax rate of 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020 was lower than the 21% federal statutory tax rate primarily due to income allocated to non-controlling interest that is not taxable to Cheniere. The effective tax rate of (72.3)% for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to a one-time tax benefit resulting from the release of a significant portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The effective tax rate of 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018 was lower than the 21% statutory rate primarily as a result of maintaining a valuation allowance against our federal and state net deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate may continue to experience volatility prospectively due to variability in our pre-tax and taxable earnings and the proportion of such earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest\n2020 vs. 2019\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest slightly increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 from the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to an increase in consolidated net income recognized by Cheniere Partners, primarily a result of increased margins due to lower pricing of natural gas feedstock, partially offset by increases in (1) loss on modification or extinguishment of debt incurred in conjunction with the refinancing of the 2021 SPL Senior Notes, (2) interest expense, net of capitalized interest and (3) depreciation and amortization expense.\n2019 vs. 2018\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest decreased during the year ended December 31, 2019 from the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the annualized decrease of non-controlling interest as a result of our merger with Cheniere Holdings in September 2018, in which all publicly-held shares of Cheniere Holdings were canceled and the non-controlling interest in Cheniere Holdings was reduced to zero. The consolidated net income recognized by Cheniere Partners decreased from $1.3 billion in the year ended December 31, 2018 to $1.2 billion in the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily\ndue a decrease in income from operations from higher operating and maintenance expense and an increase in interest expense, net of capitalized interest and increased depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by increased margins due to higher volumes of LNG sold but decreased pricing on LNG.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAlthough results are consolidated for financial reporting, SPL, Cheniere Partners, CCH Group and Cheniere operate with independent capital structures. Our capital requirements include capital and investment expenditures, repayment of long-term debt and repurchase of our shares. We expect the cash needs for at least the next twelve months will be met for each of these independent capital structures as follows:\n\u2022SPL through project debt and borrowings, operating cash flows and equity contributions from Cheniere Partners;\n\u2022Cheniere Partners through operating cash flows from SPLNG, SPL and CTPL and debt or equity offerings;\n\u2022CCH Group through operating cash flows from CCL and CCP, project debt and borrowings and equity contributions from Cheniere; and\n\u2022Cheniere through existing unrestricted cash, debt and equity offerings by us or our subsidiaries, operating cash flows, borrowings, services fees from our subsidiaries and distributions from our investment in Cheniere Partners.\nThe following table provides a summary of our liquidity position at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\n(1) Amounts presented include balances held by our consolidated variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d), Cheniere Partners, as discussed in Note 9-Non-controlling Interest and Variable Interest Entity of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, assets of Cheniere Partners, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, included $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents.\nSabine Pass LNG Terminal\nLiquefaction Facilities\nThe SPL Project is one of the largest LNG production facilities in the world. Through Cheniere Partners, we are currently operating five Trains and two marine berths at the SPL Project, and are constructing one additional Train that is expected to be substantially completed in the second half of 2022, and a third marine berth. We have received authorization from the FERC to site, construct and operate Trains 1 through 6, as well as for the construction of the third marine berth. We have achieved substantial completion of the first five Trains of the SPL Project and commenced commercial operating activities for each Train at various times starting in May 2016. The following table summarizes the project completion and construction status of Train 6 of the SPL Project as of December 31, 2020:\nThe following orders have been issued by the DOE authorizing the export of domestically produced LNG by vessel from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal:\n\u2022Trains 1 through 4-FTA countries and non-FTA countries through December 31, 2050, in an amount up to a combined total of the equivalent of 16 mtpa (approximately 803 Bcf/yr of natural gas).\n\u2022Trains 1 through 4-FTA countries and non-FTA countries through December 31, 2050, in an amount up to a combined total of the equivalent of approximately 203 Bcf/yr of natural gas (approximately 4 mtpa).\n\u2022Trains 5 and 6-FTA countries and non-FTA countries through December 31, 2050, in an amount up to a combined total of 503.3 Bcf/yr of natural gas (approximately 10 mtpa).\nIn December 2020, the DOE announced a new policy in which it would no longer issue short-term export authorizations separately from long-term authorizations. Accordingly, the DOE amended each of SPL\u2019s long-term authorizations to include short-term export authority, and vacated the short-term orders.\nAn application was filed in September 2019 seeking authorization to make additional exports from the SPL Project to FTA countries for a 25-year term and to non-FTA countries for a 20-year term in an amount up to the equivalent of approximately 153 Bcf/yr of natural gas, for a total SPL Project export capacity of approximately 1,662 Bcf/yr. The terms of the authorizations are requested to commence on the date of first commercial export from the SPL Project of the volumes contemplated in the application. In April 2020, the DOE issued an order authorizing SPL to export to FTA countries related to this application, for which the term was subsequently extended through December 31, 2050, but has not yet issued an order authorizing SPL to export to non-FTA countries for the corresponding LNG volume. A corresponding application for authorization to increase the total LNG production capacity of the SPL Project from the currently authorized level to approximately 1,662 Bcf/yr was also submitted to the FERC and is currently pending.\nCustomers\nSPL has entered into fixed price long-term SPAs generally with terms of 20 years (plus extension rights) and with a weighted average remaining contract length of approximately 17 years (plus extension rights) with eight third parties for Trains 1 through 6 of the SPL Project. Under these SPAs, the customers will purchase LNG from SPL for a price consisting of a fixed fee per MMBtu of LNG (a portion of which is subject to annual adjustment for inflation) plus a variable fee per MMBtu of LNG generally equal to approximately 115% of Henry Hub. The customers may elect to cancel or suspend deliveries of LNG cargoes, with advance notice as governed by each respective SPA, in which case the customers would still be required to pay the fixed fee with respect to the contracted volumes that are not delivered as a result of such cancellation or suspension. We refer to the fee component that is applicable regardless of a cancellation or suspension of LNG cargo deliveries under the SPAs as the fixed fee component of the price under SPL\u2019s SPAs. We refer to the fee component that is applicable only in connection\nwith LNG cargo deliveries as the variable fee component of the price under SPL\u2019s SPAs. The variable fees under SPL\u2019s SPAs were generally sized at the time of entry into each SPA with the intent to cover the costs of gas purchases and transportation and liquefaction fuel to produce the LNG to be sold under each such SPA. The SPAs and contracted volumes to be made available under the SPAs are not tied to a specific Train; however, the term of each SPA generally commences upon the date of first commercial delivery of a specified Train.\nIn aggregate, the annual fixed fee portion to be paid by the third-party SPA customers is approximately $2.9 billion for Trains 1 through 5. After giving effect to an SPA that Cheniere has committed to provide to SPL, the annual fixed fee portion to be paid by the third-party SPA customers would increase to at least $3.3 billion, which is expected to occur upon the date of first commercial delivery of Train 6.\nIn addition, Cheniere Marketing has an agreement with SPL to purchase at Cheniere Marketing\u2019s option, any LNG produced by SPL in excess of that required for other customers. See Marketing section for additional information regarding agreements entered into by Cheniere Marketing.\nNatural Gas Transportation, Storage and Supply\nTo ensure SPL is able to transport adequate natural gas feedstock to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, it has entered into transportation precedent and other agreements to secure firm pipeline transportation capacity with CTPL and third-party pipeline companies. SPL has entered into firm storage services agreements with third parties to assist in managing variability in natural gas needs for the SPL Project. SPL has also entered into enabling agreements and long-term natural gas supply contracts with third parties in order to secure natural gas feedstock for the SPL Project. As of December 31, 2020, SPL had secured up to approximately 4,950 TBtu of natural gas feedstock through long-term and short-term natural gas supply contracts with remaining terms that range up to 10 years, a portion of which is subject to conditions precedent.\nConstruction\nSPL entered into lump sum turnkey contracts with Bechtel Oil, Gas and Chemicals, Inc. (\u201cBechtel\u201d) for the engineering, procurement and construction of Trains 1 through 6 of the SPL Project, under which Bechtel charges a lump sum for all work performed and generally bears project cost, schedule and performance risks unless certain specified events occur, in which case Bechtel may cause SPL to enter into a change order, or SPL agrees with Bechtel to a change order.\nThe total contract price of the EPC contract for Train 6 of the SPL Project is approximately $2.5 billion, including estimated costs for the third marine berth that is currently under construction. As of December 31, 2020, we have incurred $1.9 billion under this contract.\nRegasification Facilities\nThe Sabine Pass LNG terminal has operational regasification capacity of approximately 4 Bcf/d and aggregate LNG storage capacity of approximately 17 Bcfe. Approximately 2 Bcf/d of the regasification capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal has been reserved under two long-term third-party TUAs, under which SPLNG\u2019s customers are required to pay fixed monthly fees, whether or not they use the LNG terminal. Each of Total and Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (\u201cChevron\u201d) has reserved approximately 1 Bcf/d of regasification capacity and is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to SPLNG aggregating approximately $125 million annually, prior to inflation adjustments, for 20 years that commenced in 2009. Total S.A. has guaranteed Total\u2019s obligations under its TUA up to $2.5 billion, subject to certain exceptions, and Chevron Corporation has guaranteed Chevron\u2019s obligations under its TUA up to 80% of the fees payable by Chevron.\nThe remaining approximately 2 Bcf/d of capacity has been reserved under a TUA by SPL. SPL is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to SPLNG aggregating approximately $250 million annually, prior to inflation adjustments, continuing until at least May 2036. SPL entered into a partial TUA assignment agreement with Total, whereby upon substantial completion of Train 5 of the SPL Project, SPL gained access to substantially all of Total\u2019s capacity and other services provided under Total\u2019s TUA with SPLNG. This agreement provides SPL with additional berthing and storage capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal that may be used to provide increased flexibility in managing LNG cargo loading and unloading activity, permit SPL to more flexibly manage its LNG storage capacity and accommodate the development of Train 6. Notwithstanding any arrangements between Total and SPL, payments required to be made by Total to SPLNG will continue to be made by Total to SPLNG in accordance with its TUA. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, SPL recorded $129\nmillion, $104 million and $30 million, respectively, as operating and maintenance expense under this partial TUA assignment agreement.\nUnder each of these TUAs, SPLNG is entitled to retain 2% of the LNG delivered to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal.\nCapital Resources\nWe currently expect that SPL\u2019s capital resources requirements with respect to the SPL Project will be financed through project debt and borrowings, cash flows under the SPAs and equity contributions from Cheniere Partners. We believe that with the net proceeds of borrowings, available commitments under the 2020 SPL Working Capital Facility, 2019 CQP Credit Facilities, cash flows from operations and equity contributions from Cheniere Partners, SPL will have adequate financial resources available to meet its currently anticipated capital, operating and debt service requirements with respect to Trains 1 through 6 of the SPL Project. Additionally, SPLNG generates cash flows from the TUAs, as discussed above.\nThe following table provides a summary of our capital resources from borrowings and available commitments for the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal, excluding equity contributions to our subsidiaries and cash flows from operations (as described in Sources and Uses of Cash), at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\n(1) Includes SPL\u2019s 2021 SPL Senior Notes, 6.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2022, 5.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2023, 5.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2024, 5.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2025, 5.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the \u201c2026 SPL Senior Notes\u201d), 5.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (the \u201c2027 SPL Senior Notes\u201d), 4.200% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the \u201c2028 SPL Senior Notes\u201d), 2030 SPL Senior Notes and 5.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2037 (the \u201c2037 SPL Senior Notes\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cSPL Senior Notes\u201d), as well as Cheniere Partners\u2019 $1.5 billion of 5.250% Senior Notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 CQP Senior Notes\u201d), $1.1 billion of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201c2026 CQP Senior Notes\u201d) and the 4.500% Senior Notes due 2029 (the \u201c2029 CQP Senior Notes\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cCQP Senior Notes\u201d).\n(2) Includes outstanding balances under the 2015 SPL Working Capital Facility, 2020 SPL Working Capital Facility and 2019 CQP Credit Facilities, inclusive of any portion of the 2020 SPL Working Capital Facility and 2019 CQP Credit Facilities that may be used for general corporate purposes.\n(3) Consists of 2015 SPL Working Capital Facility, 2020 SPL Working Capital Facility and 2019 CQP Credit Facilities.\n(4) Does not include equity contributions that may be available from Cheniere\u2019s borrowings and available cash and cash equivalents.\nSPL Senior Notes\nThe SPL Senior Notes are governed by a common indenture (the \u201cSPL Indenture\u201d) and the terms of the 2037 SPL Senior Notes are governed by a separate indenture (the \u201c2037 SPL Senior Notes Indenture\u201d). Both the SPL Indenture and the 2037 SPL Senior Notes Indenture contain terms and events of default and certain covenants that, among other things, limit SPL\u2019s ability and the ability of SPL\u2019s restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock, make certain investments or pay dividends or distributions on capital stock or subordinated indebtedness or purchase, redeem or retire capital stock, sell or transfer assets, including capital stock of SPL\u2019s restricted subsidiaries, restrict dividends or other payments by restricted subsidiaries, incur liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, dissolve, liquidate, consolidate, merge, sell or lease all or substantially all of SPL\u2019s assets and enter into certain LNG sales contracts. Subject to permitted liens, the SPL Senior Notes are secured on a pari passu first-priority basis by a security interest in all of the membership interests in SPL and substantially all of SPL\u2019s assets. SPL may not make any distributions until, among other requirements, deposits are made into debt service reserve accounts as required and a debt service coverage ratio test of 1.25:1.00 is satisfied.\nAt any time prior to three months before the respective dates of maturity for each series of the SPL Senior Notes (except for the 2026 SPL Senior Notes, 2027 SPL Senior Notes, 2028 SPL Senior Notes, 2030 SPL Senior Notes and 2037 SPL Senior Notes, in which case the time period is six months before the respective dates of maturity), SPL may redeem all or part of such series of the SPL Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to the \u2018make-whole\u2019 price (except for the 2037 SPL Senior Notes, in which case the redemption price is equal to the \u201coptional redemption\u201d price) set forth in the respective indentures governing the SPL Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. SPL may also, at any time within three months of the respective maturity dates for each series of the SPL Senior Notes (except for the 2026 SPL Senior Notes, 2027 SPL Senior Notes, 2028 SPL Senior Notes, 2030 SPL Senior Notes and 2037 SPL Senior Notes, in which case the time period is within six months of the respective dates of maturity), redeem all or part of such series of the SPL Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series of the SPL Senior Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.\nBoth the 2037 SPL Senior Notes Indenture and the SPL Indenture include restrictive covenants. SPL may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including by issuing additional notes, and such indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and have different maturity dates and more restrictive covenants than the current outstanding indebtedness of SPL, including the SPL Senior Notes and the 2020 SPL Working Capital Facility. Semi-annual principal payments for the 2037 SPL Senior Notes are due on March 15 and September 15 of each year beginning September 15, 2025 and are fully amortizing according to a fixed sculpted amortization schedule.\n2015 SPL Working Capital Facility\nIn March 2020, SPL terminated the remaining commitments under the 2015 SPL Working Capital Facility. As of December 31, 2019, SPL had $786 million of available commitments, $414 million aggregate amount of issued letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under the 2015 SPL Working Capital Facility.\n2020 SPL Working Capital Facility\nIn March 2020, SPL entered into the 2020 SPL Working Capital Facility with aggregate commitments of $1.2 billion, which replaced the 2015 SPL Working Capital Facility. The 2020 SPL Working Capital Facility is intended to be used for loans to SPL, swing line loans to SPL and the issuance of letters of credit on behalf of SPL, primarily for (1) the refinancing of the 2015 SPL Working Capital Facility, (2) fees and expenses related to the 2020 SPL Working Capital Facility, (3) SPL and its future subsidiaries\u2019 gas purchase obligations and (4) SPL and certain of its future subsidiaries\u2019 general corporate purposes. SPL may, from time to time, request increases in the commitments under the 2020 SPL Working Capital Facility of up to $800 million. As of December 31, 2020, SPL had $787 million of available commitments, $413 million aggregate amount of issued letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under the 2020 SPL Working Capital Facility.\nThe 2020 SPL Working Capital Facility matures on March 19, 2025, but may be extended with consent of the lenders. The 2020 SPL Working Capital Facility provides for mandatory prepayments under customary circumstances.\nThe 2020 SPL Working Capital Facility contains customary conditions precedent for extensions of credit, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. SPL is restricted from making certain distributions under agreements governing its indebtedness generally until, among other requirements, satisfaction of a 12-month forward-looking and backward-looking 1.25:1.00 debt service reserve ratio test. The obligations of SPL under the 2020 SPL Working Capital Facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of SPL as well as a pledge of all of the membership interests in SPL and certain future subsidiaries of SPL on a pari passu basis by a first priority lien with the SPL Senior Notes.\nCheniere Partners\nCQP Senior Notes\nThe CQP Senior Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by each of Cheniere Partners\u2019 subsidiaries other than SPL and, subject to certain conditions governing its guarantee, Sabine Pass LP (each a \u201cGuarantor\u201d and collectively, the \u201cCQP Guarantors\u201d). The CQP Senior Notes are governed by the same base indenture (the \u201cCQP Base Indenture\u201d). The 2025 CQP Senior Notes are further governed by the First Supplemental Indenture, the 2026 CQP Senior Notes are further governed by the Second Supplemental Indenture and the 2029 CQP Senior Notes are further governed by the Third Supplemental Indenture. The indentures governing the CQP Senior Notes contain terms and events of default and certain covenants that, among other\nthings, limit the ability of Cheniere Partners and the CQP Guarantors to incur liens and sell assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into sale-leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the applicable entity\u2019s properties or assets.\nAt any time prior to October 1, 2021 for the 2026 CQP Senior Notes and October 1, 2024 for the 2029 CQP Senior Notes, Cheniere Partners may redeem all or a part of the applicable CQP Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the CQP Senior Notes redeemed, plus the \u201capplicable premium\u201d set forth in the respective indentures governing the CQP Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. In addition, at any time prior to October 1, 2021 for the 2026 CQP Senior Notes and October 1, 2024 for the 2029 CQP Senior Notes, Cheniere Partners may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the CQP Senior Notes with an amount of cash not greater than the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 105.625% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2026 CQP Senior Notes and 104.5% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2029 CQP Senior Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. Cheniere Partners also may at any time through the maturity date of October 1, 2025 for the 2025 CQP Senior Notes, October 1, 2021 through the maturity date of October 1, 2026 for the 2026 CQP Senior Notes and October 1, 2024 through the maturity date of October 1, 2029 for the 2029 CQP Senior Notes, redeem the CQP Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices set forth in the respective indentures governing the CQP Senior Notes.\nThe CQP Senior Notes are Cheniere Partners\u2019 senior obligations, ranking equally in right of payment with Cheniere Partners\u2019 other existing and future unsubordinated debt and senior to any of its future subordinated debt. In the event that the aggregate amount of Cheniere Partners\u2019 secured indebtedness and the secured indebtedness of the CQP Guarantors (other than the CQP Senior Notes or any other series of notes issued under the CQP Base Indenture) outstanding at any one time exceeds the greater of (1) $1.5 billion and (2) 10% of net tangible assets, the CQP Senior Notes will be secured to the same extent as such obligations under the 2019 CQP Credit Facilities. The obligations under the 2019 CQP Credit Facilities are secured on a first-priority basis (subject to permitted encumbrances) with liens on substantially all the existing and future tangible and intangible assets and rights of Cheniere Partners and the CQP Guarantors and equity interests in the CQP Guarantors (except, in each case, for certain excluded properties set forth in the 2019 CQP Credit Facilities). The liens securing the CQP Senior Notes, if applicable, will be shared equally and ratably (subject to permitted liens) with the holders of other senior secured obligations, which include the 2019 CQP Credit Facilities obligations and any future additional senior secured debt obligations.\n2019 CQP Credit Facilities\nIn May 2019, Cheniere Partners entered into the 2019 CQP Credit Facilities, which consisted of the $750 million term loan (\u201cCQP Term Facility\u201d), which was prepaid and terminated upon issuance of the 2029 CQP Senior Notes in September 2019, and the $750 million revolving credit facility (\u201cCQP Revolving Facility\u201d). Borrowings under the 2019 CQP Credit Facilities will be used to fund the development and construction of Train 6 of the SPL Project and for general corporate purposes, subject to a sublimit, and the 2019 CQP Credit Facilities are also available for the issuance of letters of credit. As of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, Cheniere Partners had $750 million of available commitments and no letters of credit issued or loans outstanding under the 2019 CQP Credit Facilities.\nThe 2019 CQP Credit Facilities mature on May 29, 2024. Any outstanding balance may be repaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, except for interest rate breakage costs. The 2019 CQP Credit Facilities contain conditions precedent for extensions of credit, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants, and limit Cheniere Partners\u2019 ability to make restricted payments, including distributions, to once per fiscal quarter and one true-up per fiscal quarter as long as certain conditions are satisfied.\nThe 2019 CQP Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed and secured by a first priority lien (subject to permitted encumbrances) on substantially all of Cheniere Partners\u2019 and the CQP Guarantors\u2019 existing and future tangible and intangible assets and rights and equity interests in the CQP Guarantors (except, in each case, for certain excluded properties set forth in the 2019 CQP Credit Facilities).\nCorpus Christi LNG Terminal\nLiquefaction Facilities\nWe are currently operating two Trains and two marine berths at the CCL Project and commissioning one additional Train that is expected to be substantially completed in the first quarter of 2021. We have received authorization from the FERC to site, construct and operate Trains 1 through 3 of the CCL Project. We completed construction of Trains 1 and 2 of the CCL Project and commenced commercial operating activities in February 2019 and August 2019, respectively. The following table summarizes the project completion and construction status of Train 3 of the CCL Project, including the related infrastructure, as of December 31, 2020:\nSeparate from the CCH Group, we are also developing Corpus Christi Stage 3 through our subsidiary CCL Stage III, adjacent to the CCL Project. We received approval from FERC in November 2019 to site, construct and operate seven midscale Trains with an expected total production capacity of approximately 10 mtpa of LNG.\nThe following orders have been issued by the DOE authorizing the export of domestically produced LNG by vessel from the Corpus Christi LNG terminal:\n\u2022CCL Project-FTA countries and non-FTA countries through December 31, 2050, up to a combined total of the equivalent of 767 Bcf/yr (approximately 15 mtpa) of natural gas.\n\u2022Corpus Christi Stage 3-FTA countries and non-FTA countries through December 31, 2050 in an amount equivalent to 582.14 Bcf/yr (approximately 11 mtpa) of natural gas.\nIn December 2020, the DOE announced a new policy in which it would no longer issue short-term export authorizations separately from long-term authorizations. Accordingly, the DOE amended each of CCL\u2019s long-term authorizations to include short-term export authority, and vacated the short-term orders.\nAn application was filed in September 2019 to authorize additional exports from the CCL Project to FTA countries for a 25-year term and to non-FTA countries for a 20-year term in an amount up to the equivalent of approximately 108 Bcf/yr of natural gas, for a total CCL Project export of 875.16 Bcf/yr. The terms of the authorizations are requested to commence on the date of first commercial export from the CCL Project of the volumes contemplated in the application. In April 2020, the DOE issued an order authorizing CCL to export to FTA countries related to this application, for which the term was subsequently extended through December 31, 2050, but has not yet issued an order authorizing CCL to export to non-FTA countries for the corresponding LNG volume. A corresponding application for authorization to increase the total LNG production capacity of the CCL Project from the currently authorized level to approximately 875.16 Bcf/yr was also submitted to the FERC and is currently pending.\nCustomers\nCCL has entered into fixed price long-term SPAs generally with terms of 20 years (plus extension rights) and with a weighted average remaining contract length of approximately 19 years (plus extension rights) with nine third parties for Trains 1 through 3 of the CCL Project. Under these SPAs, the customers will purchase LNG from CCL on a free on board (\u201cFOB\u201d) basis for a price consisting of a fixed fee per MMBtu of LNG (a portion of which is subject to annual adjustment for inflation) plus a variable fee per MMBtu of LNG equal to approximately 115% of Henry Hub. The customers may elect to cancel or suspend deliveries of LNG cargoes, with advance notice as governed by each respective SPA, in which case the customers would still be required to pay the fixed fee with respect to the contracted volumes that are not delivered as a result of such cancellation or suspension. We refer to the fee component that is applicable regardless of a cancellation or suspension of LNG\ncargo deliveries under the SPAs as the fixed fee component of the price under our SPAs. We refer to the fee component that is applicable only in connection with LNG cargo deliveries as the variable fee component of the price under our SPAs. The variable fee under CCL\u2019s SPAs entered into in connection with the development of the CCL Project was sized at the time of entry into each SPA with the intent to cover the costs of gas purchases and transportation and liquefaction fuel to produce the LNG to be sold under each such SPA. The SPAs and contracted volumes to be made available under the SPAs are not tied to a specific Train; however, the term of each SPA generally commences upon the date of first commercial delivery for the applicable Train, as specified in each SPA.\nIn aggregate, the minimum annual fixed fee portion to be paid by the third-party SPA customers is approximately $1.4 billion for Trains 1 and 2 and increasing to approximately $1.8 billion following the substantial completion of Train 3 of the CCL Project.\nIn addition, Cheniere Marketing has agreements with CCL to purchase: (1) approximately 15 TBtu per annum of LNG with an approximate term of 23 years, (2) any LNG produced by CCL in excess of that required for other customers at Cheniere Marketing\u2019s option and (3) approximately 44 TBtu of LNG with a term of up to seven years associated with the IPM gas supply agreement between CCL and EOG Resources, Inc. See Marketing section for additional information regarding agreements entered into by Cheniere Marketing.\nNatural Gas Transportation, Storage and Supply\nTo ensure CCL is able to transport adequate natural gas feedstock to the Corpus Christi LNG terminal, it has entered into transportation precedent agreements to secure firm pipeline transportation capacity with CCP and certain third-party pipeline companies. CCL has entered into a firm storage services agreement with a third party to assist in managing variability in natural gas needs for the CCL Project. CCL has also entered into enabling agreements and long-term natural gas supply contracts with third parties, and will continue to enter into such agreements, in order to secure natural gas feedstock for the CCL Project. As of December 31, 2020, CCL had secured up to approximately 2,938 TBtu of natural gas feedstock through long-term natural gas supply contracts with remaining terms that range up to 10 years, a portion of which is subject to the achievement of certain project milestones and other conditions precedent.\nCCL Stage III has also entered into long-term natural gas supply contracts with third parties, and anticipates continuing to enter into such agreements, in order to secure natural gas feedstock for Corpus Christi Stage 3. As of December 31, 2020, CCL Stage III had secured up to approximately 2,361 TBtu of natural gas feedstock through long-term natural gas supply contracts with remaining terms that range up to approximately 15 years, which is subject to the achievement of certain project milestones and other conditions precedent.\nA portion of the natural gas feedstock transactions for CCL and CCL Stage III are IPM transactions, in which the natural gas producers are paid based on a global gas market price less a fixed liquefaction fee and certain costs incurred by us.\nConstruction\nCCL entered into separate lump sum turnkey contracts with Bechtel for the engineering, procurement and construction of Trains 1 through 3 of the CCL Project under which Bechtel charges a lump sum for all work performed and generally bears project cost, schedule and performance risks unless certain specified events occur, in which case Bechtel may cause CCL to enter into a change order, or CCL agrees with Bechtel to a change order.\nThe total contract price of the EPC contract for Train 3, which is currently undergoing commissioning, is approximately $2.4 billion, reflecting amounts incurred under change orders through December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we have incurred $2.4 billion under this contract.\nFinal Investment Decision for Corpus Christi Stage 3\nFID for Corpus Christi Stage 3 will be subject to, among other things, entering into an EPC contract, obtaining additional commercial support for the project and securing the necessary financing arrangements.\nPipeline Facilities\nIn November 2019, the FERC authorized CCP to construct and operate the pipeline for Corpus Christi Stage 3. The pipeline will be designed to transport 1.5 Bcf/d of natural gas feedstock required by Corpus Christi Stage 3 from the existing regional natural gas pipeline grid.\nCapital Resources\nThe CCH Group expects to finance the construction costs of the CCL Project from one or more of the following: operating cash flows from CCL and CCP, project debt and equity contributions from Cheniere. The following table provides a summary of the capital resources of the CCH Group from borrowings and available commitments for the CCL Project, excluding equity contributions from Cheniere, at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (in millions):\n(1) Includes CCH\u2019s 7.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2024, 5.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2025, 5.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2027, 3.700% Senior Secured Notes due 2029, 4.80% Senior Secured Notes due 2039, 3.925% Senior Secured Notes due 2039 and 3.52% CCH Senior Secured Notes (collectively, the \u201cCCH Senior Notes\u201d).\n(2) Aggregate original principal amount before debt discount and debt issuance costs and interest paid-in-kind.\n(3) Includes the CCH Credit Facility and CCH Working Capital Facility.\n(4) Does not include equity contributions that may be available from Cheniere\u2019s borrowings and available cash and cash equivalents.\n2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes\nIn May 2015, CCH HoldCo II issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes in a private placement. In May 2018, the amended and restated note purchase agreement under which the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes were issued was subsequently amended in connection with commercialization and financing of Train 3 of the CCL Project and to provide the note holders with certain prepayment rights related thereto consistent with those under the CCH Credit Facility. In February 2020, the amended and restated note purchase agreement for the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes was further amended to allow CCH HoldCo II the option to redeem all or a portion of the outstanding notes with cash at a price of $1,080 per $1,000 principal amount, at the time of any CCH HoldCo II or noteholder-initiated conversion through September 2, 2020. In March 2020, CCH HoldCo II redeemed an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $300 million and in July 2020, redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount with borrowings under the Cheniere Term Loan Facility.\nCCH Senior Notes\nThe CCH Senior Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by CCH\u2019s subsidiaries, CCL, CCP and Corpus Christi Pipeline GP, LLC (each a \u201cCCH Guarantor\u201d and collectively, the \u201cCCH Guarantors\u201d). The indentures governing the CCH Senior Notes contain customary terms and events of default and certain covenants that, among other things, limit CCH\u2019s ability and the ability of CCH\u2019s restricted subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; make certain investments or pay dividends or distributions on membership interests or subordinated indebtedness or purchase, redeem or retire membership interests; sell or transfer assets, including membership or partnership interests of CCH\u2019s restricted subsidiaries; restrict dividends or other payments by restricted subsidiaries to CCH or any of CCH\u2019s restricted subsidiaries; incur liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; dissolve, liquidate, consolidate, merge, sell or lease all or substantially all of the properties or assets of CCH and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole; or permit any CCH Guarantor to dissolve,\nliquidate, consolidate, merge, sell or lease all or substantially all of its properties and assets. The covenants included in the respective indentures that govern the CCH Senior Notes are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.\nThe CCH Senior Notes are CCH\u2019s senior secured obligations, ranking senior in right of payment to any and all of CCH\u2019s future indebtedness that is subordinated to the CCH Senior Notes and equal in right of payment with CCH\u2019s other existing and future indebtedness that is senior and secured by the same collateral securing the CCH Senior Notes. The CCH Senior Notes are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of CCH\u2019s and the CCH Guarantors\u2019 assets.\nAt any time prior to six months before the respective dates of maturity for each of the CCH Senior Notes, CCH may redeem all or part of such series of the CCH Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to the \u201cmake-whole\u201d price set forth in the appropriate indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. At any time within six months of the respective dates of maturity for each of the CCH Senior Notes, CCH may redeem all or part of such series of the CCH Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the CCH Senior Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.\nCCH Credit Facility\nIn May 2018, CCH amended and restated the CCH Credit Facility to increase total commitments under the CCH Credit Facility from $4.6 billion to $6.1 billion. The obligations of CCH under the CCH Credit Facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of CCH and its subsidiaries and by a pledge by CCH HoldCo I of its limited liability company interests in CCH. There were no available commitments under the CCH Credit Facility as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. CCH had $2.6 billion and $3.3 billion of loans outstanding under the CCH Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe CCH Credit Facility matures on June 30, 2024, with principal payments due quarterly commencing on the earlier of (1) the first quarterly payment date occurring more than three calendar months following the completion of the CCL Project as defined in the common terms agreement and (2) a set date determined by reference to the date under which a certain LNG buyer linked to the last Train of the CCL Project to become operational is entitled to terminate its SPA for failure to achieve the date of first commercial delivery for that agreement. Scheduled repayments will be based upon a 19-year tailored amortization, commencing the first full quarter after the completion of Trains 1 through 3 and designed to achieve a minimum projected fixed debt service coverage ratio of 1.50:1.\nUnder the CCH Credit Facility, CCH is required to hedge not less than 65% of the variable interest rate exposure of its senior secured debt. CCH is restricted from making certain distributions under agreements governing its indebtedness generally until, among other requirements, the completion of the construction of Trains 1 through 3 of the CCL Project, funding of a debt service reserve account equal to six months of debt service and achieving a historical debt service coverage ratio and fixed projected debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.00.\nCCH Working Capital Facility\nIn June 2018, CCH amended and restated the CCH Working Capital Facility to increase total commitments under the CCH Working Capital Facility from $350 million to $1.2 billion. The CCH Working Capital Facility is intended to be used for loans to CCH (\u201cCCH Working Capital Loans\u201d) and the issuance of letters of credit on behalf of CCH for certain working capital requirements related to developing and operating the CCL Project and for related business purposes. Loans under the CCH Working Capital Facility are guaranteed by the CCH Guarantors. CCH may, from time to time, request increases in the commitments under the CCH Working Capital Facility of up to the maximum allowed for working capital under the Common Terms Agreement that was entered into concurrently with the CCH Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, CCH had $767 million and $729 million of available commitments, $293 million and $471 million aggregate amount of issued letters of credit and $140 million and zero of loans outstanding under the CCH Working Capital Facility, respectively.\nThe CCH Working Capital Facility matures on June 29, 2023, and CCH may prepay the CCH Working Capital Loans and loans made in connection with a draw upon any letter of credit (\u201cCCH LC Loans\u201d) at any time without premium or penalty upon three business days\u2019 notice and may re-borrow at any time. CCH LC Loans have a term of up to one year. CCH is required to reduce the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all CCH Working Capital Loans to zero for a period of five consecutive business days at least once each year.\nThe CCH Working Capital Facility contains conditions precedent for extensions of credit, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. The obligations of CCH under the CCH Working Capital Facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of CCH and the CCH Guarantors as well as all of the membership interests in CCH and each of the CCH Guarantors on a pari passu basis with the CCH Senior Notes and the CCH Credit Facility.\nCheniere\nSenior Notes\nIn September 2020, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion of 2028 Cheniere Senior Secured Notes, the proceeds of which were used to prepay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the Cheniere Term Loan Facility and to pay related fees and expenses. The associated indentures (\u201cCheniere Indenture\u201d) contain customary terms and events of default and certain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to create liens or other encumbrances, enter into sale-leaseback transactions and merge or consolidate with other entities or sell all or substantially all of our assets. The Cheniere Indenture covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.\nAt any time prior to October 15, 2023, we may redeem all or a part of the 2028 Cheniere Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus the \u201capplicable premium\u201d and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the date of redemption. We also may, at any time prior to October 15, 2023, redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Cheniere Senior Secured Notes with an amount of cash not greater than the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 104.625% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including, the date of redemption. At any time on or after October 15, 2023 through the maturity date of October 15, 2028, we may redeem all or part of the 2028 Cheniere Senior Secured Notes at the redemption prices described in the Cheniere Indenture.\nThe 2028 Cheniere Senior Secured Notes are our general senior obligations and rank senior in right of payment to all of our future obligations that are, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2028 Cheniere Senior Secured Notes and equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness. The 2028 Cheniere Senior Secured Notes will initially be secured on a first-priority basis by a lien on substantially all of our assets and equity interests in our direct subsidiaries (other than certain excluded subsidiaries) (the \u201cCollateral\u201d), which liens will rank pari passu with the liens securing the Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility and Cheniere Term Loan Facility. The 2028 Cheniere Senior Secured Notes will remain secured as long as (1) there are any obligations or undrawn commitments outstanding under the Cheniere Term Loan Facility that are secured by liens on the Collateral or (2) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our secured indebtedness exceeds $1.25 billion. As of December 31, 2020, the 2028 Cheniere Senior Secured Notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. In the future, the 2028 Cheniere Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed by our subsidiaries who guarantee our other material indebtedness.\nConvertible Notes\nIn November 2014, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion of the 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes. The 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes are convertible at the option of the holder into our common stock at the then applicable conversion rate, provided that the closing price of our common stock is greater than or equal to the conversion price on the date of conversion. In July 2020, we repurchased $844 million in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes at individually negotiated prices from a small number of investors.\nIn March 2015, we issued $625 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2045 (the \u201c2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes\u201d). We have the right, at our option, at any time after March 15, 2020, to redeem all or any part of the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to the accreted amount of the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to such redemption date.\nWe have the option to satisfy the conversion obligation for the 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes and the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes with cash, common stock or a combination thereof.\nCheniere Revolving Credit Facility\nIn December 2018, we amended and restated the Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility to increase total commitments under the Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility from $750 million to $1.25 billion. The Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility is intended to fund, through loans and letters of credit, equity capital contributions to CCH HoldCo II and its subsidiaries for the development of the CCL Project and, provided that certain conditions are met, for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $1.1 billion and $665 million of available commitments, $124 million and $585 million aggregate amount of issued letters of credit and no loans outstanding under the Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility, respectively.\nThe Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility matures on December 13, 2022 and contains representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants customary for companies like us with lenders of the type participating in the Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility that limit our ability to make restricted payments, including distributions, unless certain conditions are satisfied, as well as limitations on indebtedness, guarantees, hedging, liens, investments and affiliate transactions. Under the Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to ensure that the sum of our unrestricted cash and the amount of undrawn commitments under the Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility is at least equal to the lesser of (1) 20% of the commitments under the Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility and (2) $200 million (the \u201cLiquidity Covenant\u201d). However, at any time that the aggregate principal amount of outstanding loans plus drawn and unreimbursed letters of credit under the Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility is greater than 30% of aggregate commitments under the Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility, the Liquidity Covenant will not apply and we will instead be governed by a quarterly non-consolidated leverage ratio covenant not to exceed 5.75:1.00 (the \u201cSpringing Leverage Covenant\u201d).\nThe Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a first priority security interest (subject to permitted liens and other customary exceptions) in substantially all of our assets, including our interests in our direct subsidiaries (excluding CCH HoldCo II and certain other subsidiaries).\nCheniere Term Loan Facility\nIn June 2020, we entered into the Cheniere Term Loan Facility, which was subsequently increased to $2.695 billion in July 2020. In July 2020, borrowings under the Cheniere Term Loan Facility were used to (1) redeem the outstanding principal amount of the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes, (2) repurchase $844 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes at individually negotiated prices from a small number of investors and (3) pay the related fees and expenses. The remaining commitments under the Cheniere Term Loan Facility are expected to be used to repay and/or repurchase a portion of the remaining principal amount of the 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes and for the payment of related fees and expenses. In September 2020, we prepaid approximately $2.1 billion of the outstanding indebtedness of the Cheniere Term Loan Facility with net proceeds from the 2028 Cheniere Senior Secured Notes and available cash. As of December 31, 2020, we had $372 million of available commitments and $148 million of loans outstanding under the Cheniere Term Loan Facility.\nThe Cheniere Term Loan Facility matures on June 18, 2023. Loans under the Cheniere Term Loan Facility may be voluntarily prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time, without premium or penalty. Borrowings under the Cheniere Term Loan Facility are subject to customary conditions precedent. The Cheniere Term Loan Facility includes representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default customary for companies like us with lenders of the type participating in the Cheniere Term Loan Facility and consistent with the equivalent provisions contained in the Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Cheniere Term Loan Facility is secured by a first priority security interest (subject to permitted liens and other customary exceptions) on a pari passu basis with the Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility in substantially all of our assets and equity interests in direct subsidiaries (other than certain excluded subsidiaries). Upon redemption of the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes in July 2020, the equity interests in CCH HoldCo II were pledged as collateral to secure the obligations under the Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility and the Cheniere Term Loan Facility.\nCash Receipts from Subsidiaries\nOur ownership interest in the Sabine Pass LNG terminal is held through Cheniere Partners. As of December 31, 2020, we owned a 48.6% limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners in the form of 239.9 million common units. In July 2020, the financial tests required for conversion of Cheniere Partners\u2019 subordinated units, all of which were held by us, were met under\nthe terms of Cheniere Partners\u2019 partnership agreement and effective August 17, 2020, the first business day following the payment of the quarterly distribution with respect to the quarter ended June 30, 2020, all of Cheniere Partners\u2019 subordinated units were automatically converted into common units on a one-for-one basis and the subordination period was terminated. We also own 100% of the general partner interest and the incentive distribution rights in Cheniere Partners. We are eligible to receive quarterly equity distributions from Cheniere Partners related to our ownership interests and our incentive distribution rights.\nWe also receive fees for providing management services to some of our subsidiaries. We received $120 million, $119 million and $85 million in total service fees from these subsidiaries during the each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn June 3, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) authorized a 3-year, $1.0 billion share repurchase program. The following table presents information with respect to repurchases of common stock during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had up to $596 million of the share repurchase program available. Under the share repurchase program, repurchases can be made from time to time using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, all in accordance with the rules of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements. The timing and amount of any shares of our common stock that are repurchased under the share repurchase program will be determined by our management based on market conditions and other factors. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time or from time to time at our discretion.\nMarketing\nWe market and sell LNG produced by the Liquefaction Projects that is not required for other customers through our integrated marketing function. We have, and continue to develop, a portfolio of long-, medium- and short-term SPAs to transport and unload commercial LNG cargoes to locations worldwide. These volumes are expected to be primarily sourced by LNG produced by the Liquefaction Projects but supplemented by volumes procured from other locations worldwide, as needed. As of December 31, 2020, we have sold or have options to sell approximately 4,995 TBtu of LNG to be delivered to customers between 2021 and 2045, including volume from an SPA Cheniere Marketing has committed to provide to SPL. The cargoes have been sold either on a FOB basis (delivered to the customer at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal or the Corpus Christi LNG terminal, as applicable) or a delivered at terminal (\u201cDAT\u201d) basis (delivered to the customer at their specified LNG receiving terminal). We have chartered LNG vessels to be utilized for cargoes sold on a DAT basis.\nCheniere Marketing entered into uncommitted trade finance facilities with available credit of $241 million as of December 31, 2020, primarily to be used for the purchase and sale of LNG for ultimate resale in the course of its operations. The finance facilities are intended to be used for advances, guarantees or the issuance of letters of credit or standby letters of credit on behalf of Cheniere Marketing. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Cheniere Marketing had $34 million and $41 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit and guarantees outstanding under the finance facilities. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no loans outstanding under the finance facilities. Cheniere Marketing pays interest or fees on utilized commitments.\nCorporate and Other Activities\nWe are required to maintain corporate and general and administrative functions to serve our business activities described above. The development of our sites or other projects, including infrastructure projects in support of natural gas supply and LNG demand, will require, among other things, acceptable commercial and financing arrangements before we make an FID.\nWe have made an equity investment in Midship Holdings, which manages the business and affairs of Midship Pipeline. Midship Pipeline operates the Midship Project with current capacity of up to 1.1 million Dekatherms per day that connects new gas production in the Anadarko Basin to Gulf Coast markets, including markets serving the Liquefaction Projects. The Midship Project was placed in service in April 2020.\nRestrictive Debt Covenants\nAs of December 31, 2020, each of our issuers was in compliance with all covenants related to their respective debt agreements.\nLIBOR\nThe use of LIBOR is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021. It is currently unclear whether LIBOR will be utilized beyond that date or whether it will be replaced by a particular rate. We intend to continue working with our lenders and counterparties to pursue any amendments to our debt and derivative agreements that are currently subject to LIBOR and will continue to monitor, assess and plan for the phase out of LIBOR.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe following table summarizes the sources and uses of our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions). The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, these amounts differ from the amounts of capital expenditures, including accruals, which are referred to elsewhere in this report. Additional discussion of these items follows the table.\nOperating Cash Flows\nOur operating cash net inflows during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $1,265 million, $1,833 million and $1,990 million, respectively. The $568 million decrease in operating cash inflows in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily related to repayment of paid-in-kind interest related to the redemption of the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes, repurchase of a portion of the 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes and an increase in cash paid for interest, partially offset by the increased cash receipts from the sale of LNG cargoes due to additional LNG volume available to be sold from additional Trains that have reached substantial completion between the periods, a portion of which the customers elected not to take delivery but were required to pay a fixed fee with respect to the contracted volumes. The $157 million decrease in operating cash inflows in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily related to increased operating costs and expenses, which were partially offset by increased cash receipts from the sale of LNG cargoes, as a result of the additional Trains that were operating at the Liquefaction Projects in 2019.\nProceeds from Issuance of Debt, Repayments of Debt, Debt Issuance and Other Financing Costs and Debt Modification or Extinguishment Costs\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $4.8 billion in senior secured notes to refinance our near-term debt and repay or prepay the outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities and convertible notes. Borrowings of $3.1 billion under our credit facilities were used to redeem or repurchase our convertible notes, to fund our working capital requirements or for general corporate purposes. We incurred $125 million of debt issuance costs primarily related to up-front fees paid and $172 million of debt modification or extinguishment costs upon the closing of these transactions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $4.2 billion in senior notes to prepay the outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities. Borrowings of $2.2 billion under our credit facilities were used for funding future capital expenditures in connection with the construction costs for the Liquefaction Projects, to fund our working capital requirements or for general corporate purposes. We incurred $51 million of debt issuance costs primarily related to up-front fees paid and $15 million of debt modification or extinguishment costs upon the closing of these transactions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion in senior notes to prepay the outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities. Borrowings of $3.2 billion under our credit facilities during the year were used for funding future capital expenditures in connection with the construction costs for the Liquefaction Projects, to fund our working capital requirements or for general corporate purposes. We incurred $66 million of debt issuance costs primarily related to up-front fees paid and $17 million of debt modification or extinguishment costs upon the closing of these transactions.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net\nCash outflows for property, plant and equipment were primarily for the construction costs for the Liquefaction Projects. These costs are capitalized as construction-in-process until achievement of substantial completion.\nDistributions and Dividends to Non-controlling Interest\nWe own a 48.6% limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners, with the remaining non-controlling interest held by The Blackstone Group Inc., Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and the public, to whom we paid distributions and dividends during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nInvestment in Equity Method Investment\nWe invested $100 million, $105 million and $25 million in Midship Holdings, our equity method investment, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nRepurchase of Common Stock\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we paid $155 million and $249 million, respectively, to repurchase approximately 3 million shares and 4 million shares, respectively, of our common stock under the share repurchase program.\nContractual Obligations\nWe are committed to make cash payments in the future pursuant to certain of our contracts. The following table summarizes certain contractual obligations in place as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):\n(1)Agreements in force as of December 31, 2020 that have terms dependent on project milestone dates are based on the estimated dates as of December 31, 2020.\n(2)Based on the total debt balance, scheduled maturities and fixed or estimated forward interest rates in effect at December 31, 2020. Debt balance is presented net of $501 million in debt discount for outstanding convertible notes with significant spread between the coupon rate and the effective interest rate. The debt discount and the repayment of paid in kind interest are included in interest payments, which is consistent with the presentation in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Interest payment obligations exclude adjustments for interest rate swap agreements. A discussion of our debt obligations can be found in Note 11-Debt of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(3)Operating lease obligations primarily relate to LNG vessel time charters, land sites related to the Liquefaction Projects and corporate office leases. Operating lease obligations do not include $1.6 billion of legally binding minimum lease payments for vessel charters which were executed as of December 31, 2020 but will commence between 2021 and 2022 and have fixed minimum lease terms of up to seven years. A discussion of our lease obligations can be found in Note 12-Leases of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(4)Finance lease obligations consist of tug leases supporting the CCL Project, as further discussed in Note 12-Leases of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(5)Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding that specify fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased. We include only contracts for which conditions precedent have been met. As project milestones and other conditions precedent are achieved, our obligations are expected to increase accordingly. We include contracts for which we have an early termination option if the option is not expected to be exercised.\n(6)Construction obligations primarily consist of the estimated remaining cost pursuant to our EPC contracts as of December 31, 2020 for projects with respect to which we have made an FID to commence construction. A discussion of these obligations can be found at Note 20-Commitments and Contingencies of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(7)Pricing of natural gas supply agreements is based on estimated forward prices and basis spreads as of December 31, 2020. Natural gas supply, transportation and storage service agreements includes $1.5 billion in payments under agreements with related parties as discussed in Note 14-Related Party Transactions of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(8)Other purchase obligations primarily relate to payments under SPL\u2019s partial TUA assignment agreement with Total as discussed in Note 13-Revenues from Contracts with Customers of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had $830 million aggregate amount of issued letters of credit under our credit facilities. We also had tax agreements with certain local taxing jurisdictions for an aggregate amount of $196 million to be paid through 2033, based on estimated tax obligations as of December 31, 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had no transactions that met the definition of off-balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial position or operating results.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Management evaluates its estimates and related assumptions regularly, including those related to the valuation of derivative instruments. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve significant judgment.\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments\nAll derivative instruments, other than those that satisfy specific exceptions, are recorded at fair value. We record changes in the fair value of our derivative positions based on the value for which the derivative instrument could be exchanged between willing parties. If market quotes are not available to estimate fair value, management\u2019s best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or determined through industry-standard valuation approaches. Such evaluations may involve significant judgment and the results are based on expected future events or conditions, particularly for those valuations using inputs unobservable in the market.\nOur derivative instruments consist of interest rate swaps, financial commodity derivative contracts transacted in an over-the-counter market, physical commodity contracts and foreign currency exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) contracts. We value our interest rate swaps using observable inputs including interest rate curves, risk adjusted discount rates, credit spreads and other relevant data. Valuation of our financial commodity derivative contracts is determined using observable commodity price curves and other relevant data. We estimate the fair values of our FX derivative instruments using observable FX rates and other relevant data.\nValuation of our physical commodity contracts is predominantly driven by observable and unobservable market commodity prices and, as applicable to our natural gas supply contracts, our assessment of the associated events deriving fair value, including evaluating whether the respective market is available as pipeline infrastructure is developed. The fair value of our physical commodity contracts incorporates risk premiums related to the satisfaction of conditions precedent, such as completion and placement into service of relevant pipeline infrastructure to accommodate marketable physical gas flow. A portion of our physical commodity contracts require us to make critical accounting estimates that involve significant judgment, as the fair value is developed through the use of internal models which incorporate significant unobservable inputs. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks, such as future prices of energy units for unobservable periods, liquidity, volatility and contract duration.\nGains and losses on derivative instruments are recognized in earnings. The ultimate fair value of our derivative instruments is uncertain, and we believe that it is reasonably possible that a change in the estimated fair value could occur in the near future as interest rates, commodity prices and FX rates change.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nFor descriptions of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarketing and Trading Commodity Price Risk\nWe have entered into commodity derivatives consisting of natural gas supply contracts for the commissioning and operation of the SPL Project, the CCL Project and potential future development of Corpus Christi Stage 3 (\u201cLiquefaction Supply Derivatives\u201d). We have also entered into financial derivatives to hedge the exposure to the commodity markets in\nwhich we have contractual arrangements to purchase or sell physical LNG (\u201cLNG Trading Derivatives\u201d). In order to test the sensitivity of the fair value of the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives and the LNG Trading Derivatives to changes in underlying commodity prices, management modeled a 10% change in the commodity price for natural gas for each delivery location and a 10% change in the commodity price for LNG, respectively, as follows (in millions):\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk primarily when we incur debt related to project financing. Interest rate risk is managed in part by replacing outstanding floating-rate debt with fixed-rate debt with varying maturities. CCH has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to volatility in a portion of the floating-rate interest payments under the CCH Credit Facility (\u201cCCH Interest Rate Derivatives\u201d) and to hedge against changes in interest rates that could impact anticipated future issuance of debt by CCH (\u201cCCH Interest Rate Forward Start Derivatives\u201d). In order to test the sensitivity of the fair value of the CCH Interest Rate Derivatives to changes in interest rates, management modeled a 10% change in the forward one-month LIBOR curve across the remaining terms of the CCH Interest Rate Derivatives and CCH Interest Rate Forward Start Derivatives as follows (in millions):\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe have entered into foreign currency exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) contracts to hedge exposure to currency risk associated with operations in countries outside of the United States (\u201cFX Derivatives\u201d). In order to test the sensitivity of the fair value of the FX Derivatives to changes in FX rates, management modeled a 10% change in FX rate between the U.S. dollar and the applicable foreign currencies as follows (in millions):\nSee Note 7-Derivative Instruments for additional details about our derivative instruments.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S REPORT TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF CHENIERE ENERGY, INC.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAs management, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Cheniere Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries (\u201cCheniere\u201d). In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we have conducted an assessment, including testing using the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Cheniere\u2019s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and, even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nBased on our assessment, we have concluded that Cheniere maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nCheniere\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report on Cheniere\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, which is contained in this Form 10-K.\nManagement\u2019s Certifications\nThe certifications of Cheniere\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 have been included as Exhibits 31 and 32 in Cheniere\u2019s Form 10-K.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC.\nBy: /s/ Jack A. Fusco By: /s/ Zach Davis\nJack A. Fusco Zach Davis\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n(Principal Executive Officer) Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n(Principal Financial Officer)\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nCheniere Energy, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cheniere Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedules I to II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 23, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 due to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and subsequent amendments thereto.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nFair value of the level 3 physical liquefaction supply derivatives\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded fair value of level 3 physical liquefaction supply derivatives of $241 million, as of December 31, 2020. The physical liquefaction supply derivatives consist of natural gas supply contracts for the operation of the liquefied natural gas facilities. The fair value of the level 3 physical liquefaction supply derivatives is developed through the use of internal models which incorporate significant unobservable inputs.\nWe identified the evaluation of the fair value of the level 3 physical liquefaction supply derivatives as a critical audit matter. Specifically, there is subjectivity in certain assumptions used to estimate the fair value, including assumptions for\nfuture prices of energy units for unobservable periods and liquidity. Additionally, the fair value for certain of the liquefaction supply derivatives is derived through the use of complex models, which also include assumptions for volatility.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the valuation of the level 3 physical liquefaction supply derivatives. This included controls related to the assumptions for significant unobservable inputs and the fair value models. For the level 3 liquefaction supply derivatives selected, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills who assisted in:\n\u2022assessing the models and volatility used by the Company in its valuation by developing independent fair value estimates and comparing the independently developed estimates to the Company\u2019s fair value estimates\n\u2022testing the future prices of energy units for unobservable periods and liquidity assumptions by comparing to market data, including quoted or published forward prices for similar commodities.\nIn addition, we evaluated the Company\u2019s assumptions for future prices of energy units for unobservable periods and liquidity by comparing to market or third-party data, including adjustments for third party quoted transportation prices.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nKPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2014.\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 23, 2021\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nCheniere Energy, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Cheniere Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries\u2019 (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedules I to II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 23, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nKPMG LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 23, 2021\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1-ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nCheniere, a Delaware corporation, is a Houston-based energy infrastructure company primarily engaged in LNG-related businesses. We are operating and constructing two natural gas liquefaction and export facilities at Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi.\nThe Sabine Pass LNG terminal is located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, on the Sabine-Neches Waterway less than four miles from the Gulf Coast. Cheniere Partners, through its subsidiary SPL, is currently operating five natural gas liquefaction Trains and is constructing one additional Train that is expected to be substantially completed in the second half of 2022, for a total production capacity of approximately 30 mtpa of LNG (the \u201cSPL Project\u201d) at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal. The Sabine Pass LNG terminal has operational regasification facilities owned by Cheniere Partners\u2019 subsidiary, SPLNG, that include pre-existing infrastructure of five LNG storage tanks, two marine berths and vaporizers and an additional marine berth that is under construction. Cheniere Partners also owns a 94-mile pipeline that interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG terminal with a number of large interstate pipelines (the \u201cCreole Trail Pipeline\u201d) through its subsidiary, CTPL. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 100% of the general partner interest and 48.6% of the limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners.\nThe Corpus Christi LNG terminal is located near Corpus Christi, Texas and is operated and constructed by our subsidiary, CCL. We are currently operating two Trains and one additional Train is undergoing commissioning for a total production capacity of approximately 15 mtpa of LNG. We also operate a 23-mile natural gas supply pipeline that interconnects the Corpus Christi LNG terminal with several interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines (the \u201cCorpus Christi Pipeline\u201d and together with the Trains, the \u201cCCL Project\u201d) through our subsidiary, CCP. The CCL Project, once fully constructed, will contain three LNG storage tanks and two marine berths.\nAdditionally, separate from the CCH Group, we are developing an expansion of the Corpus Christi LNG terminal adjacent to the CCL Project (\u201cCorpus Christi Stage 3\u201d) through our subsidiary CCL Stage III, for up to seven midscale Trains with an expected total production capacity of approximately 10 mtpa of LNG. We received approval from FERC in November 2019 to site, construct and operate the expansion project.\nWe remain focused on operational excellence and customer satisfaction. Increasing demand of LNG has allowed us to expand our liquefaction infrastructure in a financially disciplined manner. We have increased available liquefaction capacity at our Liquefaction Projects as a result of debottlenecking and other optimization projects. We hold significant land positions at both the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and the Corpus Christi LNG terminal which provide opportunity for further liquefaction capacity expansion. The development of these sites or other projects, including infrastructure projects in support of natural gas supply and LNG demand, will require, among other things, acceptable commercial and financing arrangements before we make a final investment decision (\u201cFID\u201d).\nNOTE 2-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Cheniere, its majority owned subsidiaries and entities in which it holds a controlling interest, including the accounts of Cheniere Partners and its wholly owned subsidiaries. For those consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, the portion of the net income or loss attributable to the non-controlling interest is reported as net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in non-controlled entities, over which Cheniere has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, with our share of earnings or losses reported in other income (expense) on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. In applying the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognized at cost, and subsequently adjusted for our proportionate share of earnings, losses and distributions. Investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting are reported as a component of other noncurrent assets.\nWe make a determination at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d). Generally, a VIE is an entity that\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\ndoes not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, whose equity investors lack any characteristics of a controlling financial interest or which was established with non-substantive voting. We consolidate VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is generally the party that both: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity. This guidance simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments primarily by eliminating the existing cash conversion and beneficial conversion models within Subtopic 470-20, which will result in fewer embedded conversion options being accounted for separately from the debt host. The guidance also amends and simplifies the calculation of earnings per share relating to convertible instruments. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within that reporting period, with earlier adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within that reporting period, using either a full or modified retrospective approach. We plan to adopt this guidance on January 1, 2022 and are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This guidance primarily provides temporary optional expedients which simplify the accounting for contract modifications to existing debt agreements expected to arise from the market transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates. The optional expedients were available to be used upon issuance of this guidance but we have not yet applied the guidance because we have not yet modified any of our existing contracts for reference rate reform. Once we apply an optional expedient to a modified contract and adopt this standard, the guidance will be applied to all subsequent applicable contract modifications until December 31, 2022, at which time the optional expedients are no longer available.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Management evaluates its estimates and related assumptions regularly, including those related to fair value measurements, revenue recognition, property, plant and equipment, derivative instruments, leases, goodwill, asset retirement obligations (\u201cAROs\u201d), share-based compensation and income taxes including valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, as further discussed under the respective sections within this note. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Hierarchy Levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation approaches used to measure fair value. Hierarchy Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy Level 2 inputs are inputs that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, other than quoted prices included within Level 1. Hierarchy Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.\nIn determining fair value, we use observable market data when available, or models that incorporate observable market data. In addition to market information, we incorporate transaction-specific details that, in management\u2019s judgment, market participants would take into account in measuring fair value. We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize our use of unobservable inputs in arriving at fair value estimates.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nRecurring fair-value measurements are performed for derivative instruments as disclosed in Note 7-Derivative Instruments. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates fair value. The fair value of debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay to repurchase our debt in the open market, including any premium or discount attributable to the difference between the stated interest rate and market interest rate at each balance sheet date. Debt fair values, as disclosed in Note 11-Debt, are based on quoted market prices for identical instruments, if available, or based on valuations of similar debt instruments using observable or unobservable inputs. Non-financial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value include intangible assets, goodwill and AROs.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised goods or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Revenues from the sale of LNG are recognized as LNG revenues, including LNG revenues generated by our integrated marketing function that are reported on a gross or net basis based on an assessment of whether it is acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction. LNG regasification capacity payments are recognized as regasification revenues. See Note 13-Revenues from Contracts with Customers for further discussion of revenues.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash consists of funds that are contractually or legally restricted as to usage or withdrawal and have been presented separately from cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAccounts and Notes Receivable\nAccounts and notes receivable are reported net of any current expected credit losses. Notes receivable that are not classified as trade receivables are recorded within other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current expected credit losses consider the risk of loss based on past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. A counterparty\u2019s ability to pay is assessed through a credit review process that considers payment terms, the counterparty\u2019s established credit rating or our assessment of the counterparty\u2019s credit worthiness, contract terms, payment status, and other risks or available financial assurances. Adjustments to current expected credit losses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had current expected credit losses on our accounts and notes receivable of $5 million and zero, respectively.\nInventory\nLNG and natural gas inventory are recorded at the lower of weighted average cost and net realizable value. Materials and other inventory are recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value and subsequently charged to expense when issued.\nAccounting for LNG Activities\nGenerally, we begin capitalizing the costs of our LNG terminals once the individual project meets the following criteria: (1) regulatory approval has been received, (2) financing for the project is available and (3) management has committed to commence construction. Prior to meeting these criteria, most of the costs associated with a project are expensed as incurred. These costs primarily include professional fees associated with preliminary front-end engineering and design work, costs of securing necessary regulatory approvals and other preliminary investigation and development activities related to our LNG terminals.\nGenerally, costs that are capitalized prior to a project meeting the criteria otherwise necessary for capitalization include: land acquisition costs, detailed engineering design work and certain permits that are capitalized as other non-current assets. The\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\ncosts of lease options are amortized over the life of the lease once obtained. If no land or lease is obtained, the costs are expensed.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for construction and commissioning activities, major renewals and betterments that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized, while expenditures for maintenance and repairs (including those for planned major maintenance projects) to maintain property, plant and equipment in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. We realize offsets to LNG terminal costs for sales of commissioning cargoes that were earned or loaded prior to the start of commercial operations of the respective Train during the testing phase for its construction. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line depreciation method. Upon retirement or other disposition of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the account, and the resulting gains or losses are recorded in impairment expense and loss (gain) on disposal of assets.\nManagement tests property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment might not be recoverable. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets for purposes of assessing recoverability. Recoverability generally is determined by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. If the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable, the amount of impairment loss is measured as the excess, if any, of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.\nWe did not record any impairments related to property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nInterest Capitalization\nWe capitalize interest costs during the construction period of our LNG terminals and related assets as construction-in-process. Upon commencement of operations, these costs are transferred out of construction-in-process into terminal and interconnecting pipeline facilities assets and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset.\nRegulated Natural Gas Pipelines\nThe Creole Trail Pipeline and Corpus Christi Pipeline are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC in accordance with the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. The economic effects of regulation can result in a regulated company recording as assets those costs that have been or are expected to be approved for recovery from customers, or recording as liabilities those amounts that are expected to be required to be returned to customers, in a rate-setting process in a period different from the period in which the amounts would be recorded by an unregulated enterprise. Accordingly, we record assets and liabilities that result from the regulated rate-making process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. We continually assess whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes and recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities. Based on this continual assessment, we believe the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. These regulatory assets and liabilities are primarily classified in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as other assets and other liabilities. We periodically evaluate their applicability under GAAP and consider factors such as regulatory changes and the effect of competition. If cost-based regulation ends or competition increases, we may have to reduce our asset balances to reflect a market basis less than cost and write off the associated regulatory assets and liabilities.\nItems that may influence our assessment are:\n\u2022inability to recover cost increases due to rate caps and rate case moratoriums;\n\u2022inability to recover capitalized costs, including an adequate return on those costs through the rate-making process and the FERC proceedings;\n\u2022excess capacity;\n\u2022increased competition and discounting in the markets we serve; and\n\u2022impacts of ongoing regulatory initiatives in the natural gas industry.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nNatural gas pipeline costs include amounts capitalized as an Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (\u201cAFUDC\u201d). The rates used in the calculation of AFUDC are determined in accordance with guidelines established by the FERC. AFUDC represents the cost of debt and equity funds used to finance our natural gas pipeline additions during construction. AFUDC is capitalized as a part of the cost of our natural gas pipelines. Under regulatory rate practices, we generally are permitted to recover AFUDC, and a fair return thereon, through our rate base after our natural gas pipelines are placed in service.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to cash flow variability from interest rate, commodity price and foreign currency exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) rate risk. Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value and included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities depending on the derivative position and the expected timing of settlement, unless they satisfy criteria for, and we elect, the normal purchases and sales exception. When we have the contractual right and intend to net settle, derivative assets and liabilities are reported on a net basis.\nChanges in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recorded in earnings, unless we elect to apply hedge accounting and meet specified criteria. We did not have any derivative instruments designated as cash flow or fair value hedges during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. See Note 7-Derivative Instruments for additional details about our derivative instruments.\nLeases\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and subsequent amendments thereto (\u201cASC 842\u201d) on January 1, 2019 using the optional transition approach to apply the standard at the beginning of the first quarter of 2019 with no retrospective adjustments to prior periods. The adoption of the standard resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases of approximately $550 million on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nWe determine if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception of the arrangement. When we determine the arrangement is, or contains, a lease, we classify the lease as either an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating and finance leases are recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets by recording a lease liability representing the obligation to make future lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Operating and finance lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are generally recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, we use the implicit interest rate in the lease if readily determinable. In the absence of a readily determinable implicitly interest rate, we discount our expected future lease payments using our relevant subsidiary\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is an estimate of the interest rate that a given subsidiary would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term to that of the lease term. Options to renew a lease are included in the lease term and recognized as part of the right-of-use asset and lease liability, only to the extent they are reasonably certain to be exercised. We have elected practical expedients to (1) omit leases with an initial term of 12 months or less from recognition on our balance sheet and (2) to combine both the lease and non-lease components of an arrangement in calculating the right-of-use asset and lease liability for all classes of leased assets.\nLease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense for finance leases is recognized as the sum of the amortization of the right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis and the interest on lease liabilities using the effective interest method over the lease term.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease assets, net, current operating lease liabilities and non-current operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, net, other current liabilities and non-current finance lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 12-Leases for additional details about our leases.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, derivative instruments and accounts receivable. We maintain cash balances at financial institutions, which may at times be in excess of federally insured levels. We have not incurred losses related to these balances to date.\nThe use of derivative instruments exposes us to counterparty credit risk, or the risk that a counterparty will be unable to meet its commitments. Certain of our commodity derivative transactions are executed through over-the-counter contracts which are subject to nominal credit risk as these transactions are settled on a daily margin basis with investment grade financial institutions. Collateral deposited for such contracts is recorded within other current assets. Our interest rate and FX derivative instruments are placed with investment grade financial institutions whom we believe are acceptable credit risks. We monitor counterparty creditworthiness on an ongoing basis; however, we cannot predict sudden changes in counterparties\u2019 creditworthiness. In addition, even if such changes are not sudden, we may be limited in our ability to mitigate an increase in counterparty credit risk. Should one of these counterparties not perform, we may not realize the benefit of some of our derivative instruments.\nSPL has entered into fixed price long-term SPAs generally with terms of 20 years with eight third parties, CCL has entered into fixed price long-term SPAs generally with terms of 20 years with nine third parties and our integrated marketing function has entered into a limited number of long-term SPAs with third parties. We are dependent on the respective customers\u2019 creditworthiness and their willingness to perform under their respective SPAs. See Note 21-Customer Concentration for additional details about our customer concentration.\nSPLNG has entered into two long-term TUAs with third parties for regasification capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal. SPLNG is dependent on the respective customers\u2019 creditworthiness and their willingness to perform under their respective TUAs. SPLNG has mitigated this credit risk by securing TUAs for a significant portion of its regasification capacity with creditworthy third-party customers with a minimum Standard & Poor\u2019s rating of A.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of acquisition cost of a business over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate goodwill is more likely than not impaired. Goodwill impairment evaluation requires a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. We test goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative assessment or a quantitative test. The qualitative assessment is an assessment of historical information and relevant events and circumstances to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead perform a quantitative impairment test. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and performing quantitative goodwill impairment tests.\nWe completed our annual assessment of goodwill impairment as of October 1st by performing a qualitative assessment; the tests indicated it is more likely than not that there was no impairment. Our last quantitative assessment indicated that the reporting unit\u2019s fair value substantially exceeded its carrying value. As discussed above regarding our use of estimates, our judgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimate of future cash flows used to determine the estimate of the reporting unit\u2019s fair value. The use of alternate judgments and/or assumptions could result in the recognition of impairment charges in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A lower fair value estimate in the future for our reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill. Factors that could trigger a lower fair value estimate include significant negative industry or economic trends, cost increases, disruptions to our business, regulatory or political environment changes or other unanticipated events.\nDebt\nOur debt consists of current and long-term secured and unsecured debt securities, convertible debt securities and credit facilities with banks and other lenders. Debt issuances are placed directly by us or through securities dealers or underwriters and are held by institutional and retail investors.\nDebt is recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at par value adjusted for unamortized discount or premium and net of unamortized debt issuance costs related to term notes. Debt issuance costs consist primarily of arrangement fees, professional fees, legal fees and printing costs. If debt issuance costs are incurred in connection with a line of credit\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\narrangement or on undrawn funds, they are presented as an asset on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs directly related to the issuance of debt are amortized over the life of the debt and are recorded in interest expense, net of capitalized interest using the effective interest method. Gains and losses on the extinguishment or modification of debt are recorded in gain (loss) on modification or extinguishment of debt on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe recognize AROs for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the asset and for conditional AROs in which the timing or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within our control. The fair value of a liability for an ARO is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset. This additional carrying amount is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset.\nWe have not recorded an ARO associated with the Sabine Pass LNG terminal. Based on the real property lease agreements at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, at the expiration of the term of the leases we are required to surrender the LNG terminal in good working order and repair, with normal wear and tear and casualty expected. Our property lease agreements at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal have terms of up to 90 years including renewal options. We have determined that the cost to surrender the Sabine Pass LNG terminal in good order and repair, with normal wear and tear and casualty expected, is immaterial.\nWe have not recorded an ARO associated with the Creole Trail Pipeline or the Corpus Christi Pipeline. We believe that it is not feasible to predict when the natural gas transportation services provided by the Creole Trail Pipeline or the Corpus Christi Pipeline will no longer be utilized. In addition, our right-of-way agreements associated with the Creole Trail Pipeline and the Corpus Christi Pipeline have no stipulated termination dates. We intend to operate the Creole Trail Pipeline and the Corpus Christi Pipeline as long as supply and demand for natural gas exists in the United States and intend to maintain it regularly.\nShare-based Compensation\nWe have awarded share-based compensation in the form of stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units and phantom units that are more fully described in Note 16-Share-based Compensation. We recognize share-based compensation based upon the estimated fair value of awards. The recognition period for these costs begins at either the applicable service inception date or grant date and continues throughout the requisite service period. For equity-classified share-based compensation awards (which include stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units to employees and non-employee directors), compensation cost is recognized based on the grant-date fair value and not subsequently remeasured unless modified. The fair value is recognized as expense (net of any capitalization) using the straight-line basis for awards that vest based solely on service conditions and using the accelerated recognition method for awards that vest based on performance conditions. For awards with both time and performance-based conditions, we recognize compensation cost based on the probable outcome of the performance condition at each reporting period. For liability-classified share-based compensation awards (which include phantom units), compensation costs are remeasured at fair value through settlement or maturity. We account for forfeitures as they occur.\nNon-controlling Interests\nWhen we consolidate a subsidiary, we include 100% of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the subsidiary in our Consolidated Financial Statements, even if we own less than 100% of the subsidiary. Non-controlling interests represent third-party ownership in the net assets of our consolidated subsidiaries and are presented as a component of equity. Changes in our ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in deconsolidation are generally recognized within equity. See Note 9-Non-controlling Interest and Variable Interest Entities for additional details about our non-controlling interest.\nIncome Taxes\nProvisions for income taxes are based on taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred taxes on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in our Consolidated Financial\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nStatements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the current period\u2019s provision for income taxes.\nA valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will expire before realization of the benefit or future deductibility is not probable.\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination.\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders (\u201cEPS\u201d) excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects potential dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect of unvested stock is calculated using the treasury-stock method and the dilutive effect of convertible securities is calculated using the treasury or if-converted method.\nBusiness Segment\nWe have determined that we operate as a single operating and reportable segment. Our chief operating decision maker makes resource allocation decisions and assesses performance based on financial information presented on a consolidated basis in the delivery of an integrated source of LNG to our customers.\nNOTE 3-RESTRICTED CASH\nRestricted cash consists of funds that are contractually or legally restricted as to usage or withdrawal and have been presented separately from cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, restricted cash consisted of the following (in millions):\nPursuant to the accounts agreements entered into with the collateral trustees for the benefit of SPL\u2019s debt holders and CCH\u2019s debt holders, SPL and CCH are required to deposit all cash received into reserve accounts controlled by the collateral trustees. The usage or withdrawal of such cash is restricted to the payment of liabilities related to the SPL Project and the CCL Project (collectively, the \u201cLiquefaction Projects\u201d) and other restricted payments. The majority of the cash held by our subsidiaries that is restricted to Cheniere relates to advance funding for operation and construction needs of the Liquefaction Projects.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC.

The identifiable components of our LNG terminals have depreciable lives between 7 and 50 years, as follows:\nFixed Assets and Other\nOur fixed assets and other are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line method based on estimated lives of the individual assets or groups of assets.\nNOTE 7-DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nWe have entered into the following derivative instruments that are reported at fair value:\n\u2022interest rate swaps (\u201cCCH Interest Rate Derivatives\u201d) to hedge the exposure to volatility in a portion of the floating-rate interest payments on CCH\u2019s amended and restated credit facility (the \u201cCCH Credit Facility\u201d) and previously, to hedge against changes in interest rates that could impact anticipated future issuance of debt by CCH (\u201cCCH Interest Rate Forward Start Derivatives\u201d and, collectively with the CCH Interest Rate Derivatives, the \u201cInterest Rate Derivatives\u201d);\n\u2022commodity derivatives consisting of natural gas supply contracts for the commissioning and operation of the Liquefaction Projects and potential future development of Corpus Christi Stage 3 (\u201cPhysical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives\u201d) and associated economic hedges (collectively, the \u201cLiquefaction Supply Derivatives\u201d);\n\u2022financial derivatives to hedge the exposure to the commodity markets in which we have contractual arrangements to purchase or sell physical LNG (\u201cLNG Trading Derivatives\u201d); and\n\u2022foreign currency exchange (\u201cFX\u201d) contracts to hedge exposure to currency risk associated with both LNG Trading Derivatives and operations in countries outside of the United States (\u201cFX Derivatives\u201d).\nWe recognize our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value. None of our derivative instruments are designated as cash flow or fair value hedging instruments, and changes in fair value are recorded within our Consolidated Statements of Operations to the extent not utilized for the commissioning process.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nThe following table shows the fair value of our derivative instruments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, which are classified as derivative assets, non-current derivative assets, derivative liabilities or non-current derivative liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets (in millions):\nWe value our Interest Rate Derivatives using an income-based approach utilizing observable inputs to the valuation model including interest rate curves, risk adjusted discount rates, credit spreads and other relevant data. We value our LNG Trading Derivatives and our Liquefaction Supply Derivatives using a market or option-based approach incorporating present value techniques, as needed, using observable commodity price curves, when available, and other relevant data. We value our FX Derivatives with a market approach using observable FX rates and other relevant data.\nThe fair value of our Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives is predominantly driven by observable and unobservable market commodity prices and, as applicable to our natural gas supply contracts, our assessment of the associated events deriving fair value, including evaluating whether the respective market is available as pipeline infrastructure is developed. The fair value of our Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives incorporates risk premiums related to the satisfaction of conditions precedent, such as completion and placement into service of relevant pipeline infrastructure to accommodate marketable physical gas flow. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, some of our Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives existed within markets for which the pipeline infrastructure was under development to accommodate marketable physical gas flow.\nWe include a portion of our Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy as the fair value is developed through the use of internal models which incorporate significant unobservable inputs. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks, such as future prices of energy units for unobservable periods, liquidity, volatility and contract duration.\nThe Level 3 fair value measurements of natural gas positions within our Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives could be materially impacted by a significant change in certain natural gas and international LNG prices. The following table includes quantitative information for the unobservable inputs for our Level 3 Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives as of December 31, 2020:\n(1)Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the instruments.\n(2)Spread contemplates U.S. dollar-denominated pricing.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nIncreases or decreases in basis or pricing spreads, in isolation, would decrease or increase, respectively, the fair value of our Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives.\nThe following table shows the changes in the fair value of our Level 3 Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):\n(1)Transferred into Level 3 as a result of unobservable market for the underlying natural gas purchase agreements.\nDerivative assets and liabilities arising from our derivative contracts with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis, as all counterparty derivative contracts provide for the unconditional right of set-off in the event of default. The use of derivative instruments exposes us to counterparty credit risk, or the risk that a counterparty will be unable to meet its commitments in instances when our derivative instruments are in an asset position. Additionally, counterparties are at risk that we will be unable to meet our commitments in instances where our derivative instruments are in a liability position. We incorporate both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty\u2019s nonperformance risk in fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, set-off rights and guarantees.\nInterest Rate Derivatives\nCCH has entered into interest rate swaps to protect against volatility of future cash flows and hedge a portion of the variable interest payments on the CCH Credit Facility. CCH previously also had interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in interest rates that could impact anticipated future issuance of debt. In August 2020, we settled the outstanding CCH Interest Rate Forward Start Derivatives.\nCheniere Partners previously had interest rate swaps (\u201cCQP Interest Rate Derivatives\u201d) to hedge a portion of the variable interest payments on its credit facilities. In October 2018, Cheniere Partners terminated the CQP Interest Rate Derivatives related to the 2016 CQP Credit Facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had the following Interest Rate Derivatives outstanding:\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nThe following table shows the changes in the fair value and settlements of our Interest Rate Derivatives recorded in interest rate derivative gain (loss), net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):\nCommodity Derivatives\nSPL, CCL and CCL Stage III have entered into physical natural gas supply contracts and associated economic hedges to purchase natural gas for the commissioning and operation of the Liquefaction Projects and potential future development of Corpus Christi Stage 3, respectively, which are primarily indexed to the natural gas market and international LNG indices. The remaining terms of the index-based physical natural gas supply contracts range up to approximately 15 years, some of which commence upon the satisfaction of certain events or states of affairs.\nWe have entered into, and may from time to time enter into, financial LNG Trading Derivatives in the form of swaps, forwards, options or futures to economically hedge exposure to the commodity markets in which we have contractual arrangements to purchase or sell physical LNG. We have entered into LNG Trading Derivatives to secure a fixed price position to minimize future cash flow variability associated with LNG purchase and sale transactions.\nThe following table shows the notional amounts of our Liquefaction Supply Derivatives and LNG Trading Derivatives (collectively, \u201cCommodity Derivatives\u201d):\n(1) Includes notional amounts for natural gas supply contracts that SPL and CCL have with related parties.

The following table shows the fair value of our derivatives outstanding on a gross and net basis (in millions):\nNOTE 8-OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, other non-current assets, net consisted of the following (in millions):\nEquity Method Investments\nOur equity method investments consist of interests in privately-held companies. In 2017, we acquired an equity interest in Midship Holdings, LLC (\u201cMidship Holdings\u201d), which manages the business and affairs of Midship Pipeline Company, LLC (\u201cMidship Pipeline\u201d). Midship Pipeline is currently operating an approximately 200-mile natural gas pipeline project (the \u201cMidship Project\u201d) that connects production in the Anadarko Basin to Gulf Coast markets. The Midship Project commenced operations in April 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized other-than-temporary impairment losses of $129 million related to our investment in Midship Holdings. Impairment was precipitated primarily due to declining market conditions in the energy industry and customer credit risk, resulting in a reduction in the fair value of our equity interests. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized losses of $87 million related to our investments in certain equity method investees, including Midship Holdings. Impairments were primarily the result of cost overruns and extended construction timelines for\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\noperating infrastructure of our investees\u2019 projects, resulting in a reduction of the fair value of our equity interests. The fair values of our equity interests were measured using an income approach, which utilized level 3 fair value inputs such as projected earnings and discount rates, and/or market approach. Impairment losses associated with our equity method investments are presented in other expense, net.\nOur investment in Midship Holdings, net of impairment losses, was $80 million and $105 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNOTE 9-NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY\nWe own a 48.6% limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners in the form of 239.9 million common units, with the remaining non-controlling interest held by The Blackstone Group Inc., Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and the public. In July 2020, the board of directors of Cheniere Partners\u2019 general partner confirmed and approved that, following the distribution with respect to the three months ended June 30, 2020, the financial tests required for conversion of Cheniere Partners\u2019 subordinated units, all of which were held by us, were met under the terms of Cheniere Partners\u2019 partnership agreement. Accordingly, effective August 17, 2020, the first business day following the payment of the distribution, all of Cheniere Partners\u2019 subordinated units were automatically converted into common units on a one-for-one basis and the subordination period was terminated. We also own 100% of the general partner interest and the incentive distribution rights in Cheniere Partners. Cheniere Partners is accounted for as a consolidated VIE.\nCheniere Partners is a limited partnership formed by us in 2006 to own and operate the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and related assets. Our subsidiary, Cheniere Partners GP, is the general partner of Cheniere Partners. In 2012, Cheniere Partners, Cheniere and Blackstone CQP Holdco entered into a unit purchase agreement whereby Cheniere Partners sold 100.0 million Class B units to Blackstone CQP Holdco in a private placement. The board of directors of Cheniere Partners GP was modified to include three directors appointed by Blackstone CQP Holdco, four directors appointed by us and four independent directors mutually agreed upon by Blackstone CQP Holdco and us and appointed by us. In addition, we provided Blackstone CQP Holdco with a right to maintain one board seat on our Board of Directors (our \u201cBoard\u201d). A quorum of Cheniere Partners GP directors consists of a majority of all directors, including at least two directors appointed by Blackstone CQP Holdco, two directors appointed by us and two independent directors. Blackstone CQP Holdco will no longer be entitled to appoint Cheniere Partners GP directors in the event that Blackstone CQP Holdco\u2019s ownership in Cheniere Partners is less than 20% of outstanding common units and subordinated units.\nWe have determined that Cheniere Partners GP is a VIE and that we, as the holder of the equity at risk, do not have a controlling financial interest due to the rights held by Blackstone CQP Holdco. However, we continue to consolidate Cheniere Partners as a result of Blackstone CQP Holdco\u2019s right to maintain one board seat on our Board which creates a de facto agency relationship between Blackstone CQP Holdco and us. GAAP requires that when a de facto agency relationship exists, one of the members of the de facto agency relationship must consolidate the VIE based on certain criteria. As a result, we consolidate Cheniere Partners in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nThe following table presents the summarized assets and liabilities (in millions) of Cheniere Partners, our consolidated VIE, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The assets in the table below may only be used to settle obligations of Cheniere Partners. In addition, there is no recourse to us for the consolidated VIE\u2019s liabilities.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nIssuances and Repayments\nThe following table shows the issuances and repayments of long-term debt during the year ended December 31, 2020 (in millions):\n(1)Proceeds of the 2030 SPL Senior Notes, along with available cash, were used to redeem all of SPL\u2019s outstanding 2021 SPL Senior Notes, resulting in the recognition of debt extinguishment costs of $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 relating to the payment of early redemption fees and write off of unamortized debt premium and issuance costs.\n(2)Proceeds of the 3.52% CCH Senior Secured Notes were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the CCH Credit Facility, pay costs associated with certain interest rate derivative instruments that were settled and pay certain fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with these transactions. The repayment of the CCH Credit Facility resulted in the recognition of debt extinguishment costs of $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 relating to the write off of unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs.\n(3)Proceeds of the 2028 Cheniere Senior Secured Notes, along with $200 million in available cash, were used to prepay approximately $2.1 billion of the outstanding indebtedness of the Cheniere Term Loan Facility, resulting in the recognition of debt extinguishment costs of $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The borrowings under the Cheniere Term Loan Facility, which was entered into in June 2020 with available commitments of $2.62 billion and subsequently increased to $2.695 billion in July 2020, were used to (1) redeem the outstanding principal amount of the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes remaining after the redemption of an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $300 million with available cash in March 2020, including paid-in-kind interest, with cash at a price of $1,080 per $1,000 principal amount, (2) repurchase $844 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes, including paid-in-kind interest, at individually negotiated prices from a small number of investors and (3) pay the related fees and expenses. The redemption of the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes and the repurchase of the 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes resulted in the recognition of debt extinguishment costs of $149 million and a reduction in equity associated with reacquisition of the embedded conversion option of $10 million.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nCredit Facilities and Delayed Draw Term Loan\nBelow is a summary of our credit facilities and delayed draw term loan outstanding as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):\n(1)The 2020 SPL Working Capital Facility contains customary conditions precedent for extensions of credit, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. SPL pays a commitment fee equal to an annual rate of 0.1% to 0.3% (depending on the then-current rating of SPL), which accrues on the daily amount of the total commitment less the sum of (1) the outstanding principal amount of loans, (2) letters of credit issued and (3) the outstanding principal amount of swing line loans.\n(2)We prepaid $656 million of outstanding borrowings under the CCH Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2020 using proceeds from the issuance of the 3.52% CCH Senior Secured Notes.\n(3)Borrowings under the Cheniere Term Loan Facility are subject to customary conditions precedent. The remaining commitments under the Cheniere Term Loan Facility are expected to be used to repay and/or repurchase a portion of the remaining principal amount of the 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes and for the payment of related fees and expenses. We pay a commitment fee equal to 30% of the margin for LIBOR loans multiplied by the average daily amount of undrawn commitments. If the Cheniere Term Loan Facility is still outstanding on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, as defined by the credit agreement, we will pay duration fees in an amount equal to 0.25% of the aggregate amount of commitments as of July 10, 2020, which was the date the loans were first borrowed under the Cheniere Term Loan Facility (the \u201cPayment Date\u201d). Furthermore, if the Cheniere Term Loan Facility is still outstanding on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, as defined by the credit agreement, we will pay 0.50% of the aggregate amount of commitments as of the Payment Date. Annual administrative fees must also be paid to the administrative agent for the Cheniere Term Loan Facility. Subject to customary exceptions, we are required to make mandatory prepayments with respect to the Cheniere Term Loan Facility using the net proceeds of certain events on a pro rata basis and on terms consistent with required prepayments under the Cheniere Revolving Credit Facility.\n(4)LIBOR plus (1) 2.00% to 2.75% per annum in the first year, (2) 2.50% to 3.25% per annum in the second year and (3) 3.00% to 3.75% per annum in the third year until maturity, or base rate plus (1) 1.00% to 1.75% per annum in the first year, (2) 1.50% to 2.25% per annum in the second year and (3) 2.00% to 2.75% per annum in the third year until maturity.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nConvertible Notes\nBelow is a summary of our convertible notes outstanding as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):\n(1)$372 million of the 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes is categorized as long-term debt because the remaining available commitments under the Cheniere Term Loan Facility are expected to be used to repay and/or repurchase a portion of the remaining outstanding principal amount of the 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes.\n(2)Conversion is subject to various limitations and conditions.\n(3)Redeemable at any time at a redemption price payable in cash equal to the accreted amount of the $625 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2045 (the \u201c2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes\u201d) to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to such redemption date.\n(4)Initially convertible at $93.64 (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events), provided that the closing price of our common stock is greater than or equal to the conversion price on the conversion date.\n(5)Prior to December 15, 2044, convertible only under certain circumstances as specified in the indenture; thereafter, holders may convert their notes regardless of these circumstances. The conversion rate will initially equal 7.2265 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2045 Cheniere Convertible Senior Notes, which corresponds to an initial conversion price of approximately $138.38 per share of our common stock (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events).\n(6)Rate to accrete the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to the face value over the remaining amortization period.\n(7)We amortize any debt discount and debt issuance costs using the effective interest over the period through contractual maturity.\nRestrictive Debt Covenants\nThe indentures governing our senior notes and other agreements underlying our debt contain customary terms and events of default and certain covenants that, among other things, may limit us, our subsidiaries\u2019 and its restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make certain investments or pay dividends or distributions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, each of our issuers was in compliance with all covenants related to their respective debt agreements.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nInterest Expense\nTotal interest expense, net of capitalized interest, including interest expense related to our convertible notes, consisted of the following (in millions):\nFair Value Disclosures\nThe following table shows the carrying amount and estimated fair value of our debt (in millions):\n(1)The Level 2 estimated fair value was based on quotes obtained from broker-dealers or market makers of these senior notes and other similar instruments.\n(2)The Level 3 estimated fair value was calculated based on inputs that are observable in the market or that could be derived from, or corroborated with, observable market data, including our stock price and interest rates based on debt issued by parties with comparable credit ratings to us and inputs that are not observable in the market.\n(3)The Level 3 estimated fair value approximates the principal amount because the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates and the debt may be repaid, in full or in part, at any time without penalty.\n(4)The Level 1 estimated fair value was based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities that we had the ability to access at the measurement date.\nNOTE 12-LEASES\nOur leased assets consist primarily of (1) LNG vessel time charters (\u201cvessel charters\u201d), (2) tug vessels, (3) office space and facilities and (4) land sites, all of which are classified as operating leases except for our tug vessels at the Corpus Christi LNG terminal, which are classified as finance leases.\nOur policy is to recognize leases on our balance sheet by recording a lease liability representing the obligation to make future lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. As our leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, in order to calculate the lease liability, we discounted our expected future lease payments using our relevant subsidiary\u2019s incremental borrowing rate at the later of January 1, 2019 or the commencement date of the lease. The incremental borrowing rate is an estimate of the rate of interest that a given subsidiary would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term to that of the lease term.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nMany of our leases contain renewal options exercisable at our sole discretion. Options to renew a lease are included in the lease term and recognized as part of the right-of-use asset and lease liability only to the extent they are reasonably certain to be exercised, such as when necessary to satisfy obligations that existed at the execution of the lease or when the non-renewal would otherwise result in a significant economic penalty.\nWe have elected the practical expedient to omit leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (\u201cshort-term lease\u201d) from recognition on the balance sheet. We recognize short-term lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable payments under short-term leases in the period in which the obligation is incurred.\nCertain of our leases contain non-lease components which are not separated from the lease components when calculating the right-of-use asset and lease liability per our use of the practical expedient to combine both components of an arrangement for all classes of leased assets.\nCertain of our leases also contain variable payments, such as inflation, that are not included when calculating the right-of-use asset and lease liability unless the payments are in-substance fixed.\nWe recognize lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We recognize lease expense for finance leases as the sum of the amortization of the right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis and the interest on lease liabilities using the effective interest method over the lease term.\nThe following table shows the classification and location of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (in millions):\nThe following table shows the classification and location of our lease costs on our Consolidated Statements of Operations (in millions):\n(1) Presented in cost of sales, operating and maintenance expense or selling, general and administrative expense consistent with the nature of the asset under lease.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized lease expense for all operating leases of $335 million.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nFuture annual minimum lease payments for operating and finance leases as of December 31, 2020 are as follows (in millions):\n(1) Does not include $1.6 billion of legally binding minimum lease payments primarily for vessel charters which were executed as of December 31, 2020 but will commence in future period primarily in the next two years and have fixed minimum lease terms of up to seven years.\nThe following table shows the weighted-average remaining lease term and the weighted-average discount rate for our operating leases and finance leases:\n(1)The finance leases commenced prior to the adoption of the current leasing standard under GAAP. In accordance with previous accounting guidance, the implied rate is based on the fair value of the underlying assets.\nThe following table includes other quantitative information for our operating and finance leases (in millions):\nLNG Vessel Subcharters\nFrom time to time, we sublease certain LNG vessels under charter to third parties while retaining our existing obligation to the original lessor. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had zero and $9 million in future minimum sublease payments to be received from LNG vessel subcharters, respectively. The following table shows the sublease income recognized in other revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Operations (in millions):\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nNOTE 13-REVENUES FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\nThe following table represents a disaggregation of revenue earned from contracts with customers during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):\n(1) LNG revenues include revenues for LNG cargoes in which our customers exercised their contractual right to not take delivery but remained obligated to pay fixed fees irrespective of such election. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $969 million in LNG revenues associated with LNG cargoes for which customers notified us that they would not take delivery, of which $38 million would have been recognized subsequent to December 31, 2020, if the cargoes were lifted pursuant to the delivery schedules with the customers. Revenue is generally recognized upon receipt of irrevocable notice that a customer will not take delivery because our customers have no contractual right to take delivery of such LNG cargo in future periods and our performance obligations with respect to such LNG cargo have been satisfied.\n(2) See Note 7-Derivative Instruments for additional information about our derivatives.\n(3) Includes revenues from LNG vessel subcharters. See Note 12-Leases for additional information about our subleases.\nLNG Revenues\nWe have entered into numerous SPAs with third party customers for the sale of LNG on a free on board (\u201cFOB\u201d) (delivered to the customer at either the Sabine Pass or Corpus Christi LNG terminal) or delivered at terminal (\u201cDAT\u201d) (delivered to the customer at their LNG receiving terminal) basis. Our customers generally purchase LNG for a price consisting of a fixed fee per MMBtu of LNG (a portion of which is subject to annual adjustment for inflation) plus a variable fee per MMBtu of LNG equal to approximately 115% of Henry Hub. The fixed fee component is the amount payable to us regardless of a cancellation or suspension of LNG cargo deliveries by the customers. The variable fee component is the amount generally payable to us only upon delivery of LNG plus all future adjustments to the fixed fee for inflation. The SPAs and contracted volumes to be made available under the SPAs are not tied to a specific Train; however, the term of each SPA generally commences upon the date of first commercial delivery of a specified Train.\nWe intend to primarily use LNG sourced from our Sabine Pass or Corpus Christi terminals to provide contracted volumes to our customers. However, we supplement this LNG with volumes procured from third parties. LNG revenues recognized from LNG that was procured from third parties was $414 million, $268 million and $745 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nRevenues from the sale of LNG are recognized at a point in time when the LNG is delivered to the customer, either at the Sabine Pass or Corpus Christi LNG terminal or at the customer\u2019s LNG receiving terminal, based on the terms of the contract, which is the point legal title, physical possession and the risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer. Each individual molecule of LNG is viewed as a separate performance obligation. The stated contract price (including both fixed and variable fees) per MMBtu in each LNG sales arrangement is representative of the stand-alone selling price for LNG at the time the contract was negotiated. We have concluded that the variable fees meet the exception for allocating variable consideration to specific parts of the contract. As such, the variable consideration for these contracts is allocated to each distinct molecule of LNG and recognized when that distinct molecule of LNG is delivered to the customer. Because of the use of the exception, variable consideration related to the sale of LNG is also not included in the transaction price.\nWhen we sell LNG on a DAT basis, we consider all transportation costs, including vessel chartering, loading/unloading and canal fees, as fulfillment costs and not as separate services provided to the customer within the arrangement, regardless of\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nwhether or not such activities occur prior to or after the customer obtains control of the LNG. We expense fulfillment costs as incurred unless otherwise dictated by GAAP.\nFees received pursuant to SPAs are recognized as LNG revenues only after substantial completion of the respective Train. Prior to substantial completion, sales generated during the commissioning phase are offset against the cost of construction for the respective Train, as the production and removal of LNG from storage is necessary to test the facility and bring the asset to the condition necessary for its intended use.\nRegasification Revenues\nThe Sabine Pass LNG terminal has operational regasification capacity of approximately 4 Bcf/d. Approximately 2 Bcf/d of the regasification capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal has been reserved under two long-term TUAs with unaffiliated third-party customers, under which they are required to pay fixed monthly fees regardless of their use of the LNG terminal. Each of the customers has reserved approximately 1 Bcf/d of regasification capacity. The customers are each obligated to make monthly capacity payments to SPLNG aggregating approximately $125 million annually for 20 years that commenced in 2009, which is representative of fixed consideration in the contract. A portion of this fee is adjusted annually for inflation which is considered variable consideration. The remaining capacity of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal has been reserved by SPL, for which the associated revenues are eliminated in consolidation.\nBecause SPLNG is continuously available to provide regasification service on a daily basis with the same pattern of transfer, we have concluded that SPLNG provides a single performance obligation to its customers on a continuous basis over time. We have determined that an output method of recognition based on elapsed time best reflects the benefits of this service to the customer and accordingly, LNG regasification capacity reservation fees are recognized as regasification revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective TUAs.\nIn 2012, SPL entered into a partial TUA assignment agreement with Total Gas & Power North America, Inc. (\u201cTotal\u201d), whereby upon substantial completion of Train 5 of the SPL Project, SPL gained access to substantially all of Total\u2019s capacity and other services provided under Total\u2019s TUA with SPLNG. This agreement provides SPL with additional berthing and storage capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal that may be used to provide increased flexibility in managing LNG cargo loading and unloading activity, permit SPL to more flexibly manage its LNG storage capacity and accommodate the development of Train 6. Notwithstanding any arrangements between Total and SPL, payments required to be made by Total to SPLNG will continue to be made by Total to SPLNG in accordance with its TUA and we continue to recognize the payments received from Total as revenue. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, SPL recorded $129 million, $104 million and $30 million, respectively, as operating and maintenance expense under this partial TUA assignment agreement.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table shows our contract assets, net, which are classified as other non-current assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (in millions):\nContract assets represent our right to consideration for transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a sales contract when the associated consideration is not yet due. Changes in contract assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 were primarily attributable to revenue recognized due to the delivery of LNG under certain SPAs for which the associated consideration was not yet due.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nThe following table reflects the changes in our contract liabilities, which we classify as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (in millions):\nWe record deferred revenue when we receive consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due from a customer, prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a sales contract. Changes in deferred revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are primarily attributable to differences between the timing of revenue recognition and the receipt of advance payments related to delivery of LNG under certain SPAs.\nTransaction Price Allocated to Future Performance Obligations\nBecause many of our sales contracts have long-term durations, we are contractually entitled to significant future consideration which we have not yet recognized as revenue. The following table discloses the aggregate amount of the transaction price that is allocated to performance obligations that have not yet been satisfied as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n(1) The weighted average recognition timing represents an estimate of the number of years during which we shall have recognized half of the unsatisfied transaction price.\nWe have elected the following exemptions which omit certain potential future sources of revenue from the table above:\n(1)We omit from the table above all performance obligations that are part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less.\n(2)The table above excludes substantially all variable consideration under our SPAs and TUAs. We omit from the table above all variable consideration that is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation when that performance obligation qualifies as a series. The amount of revenue from variable fees that is not included in the transaction price will vary based on the future prices of Henry Hub throughout the contract terms, to the extent customers elect to take delivery of their LNG, and adjustments to the consumer price index. Certain of our contracts contain additional variable consideration based on the outcome of contingent events and the movement of various indexes. We have not included such variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent the consideration is considered constrained due to the uncertainty of ultimate pricing and receipt. Approximately 40% and 52% of our LNG revenues from contracts included in the table above during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were related to variable consideration received from customers. During each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 3% of our regasification revenues were related to variable consideration received from customers.\nWe may enter into contracts to sell LNG that are conditioned upon one or both of the parties achieving certain milestones such as reaching FID on a certain liquefaction Train, obtaining financing or achieving substantial completion of a Train and any related facilities. These contracts are considered completed contracts for revenue recognition purposes and are included in the transaction price above when the conditions are considered probable of being met.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nNOTE 14-RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nNatural Gas Supply Agreements\nSPL and CCL are party to natural gas supply agreements with related parties in the ordinary course of business, to obtain feed gas for the operation of the Liquefaction Projects.\nSPL Natural Gas Supply Agreement\nThe term of the SPL agreement is for five years, which can commence no earlier than November 1, 2021 and no later than November 1, 2022, following the achievement of contractually-defined conditions precedent. As of December 31, 2020, the notional amount for this agreement was 91 TBtu and had a fair value of zero.\nCCL Natural Gas Supply Agreement\nThe term of the CCL agreement extends through March 2022. Under this agreement, CCL recorded $13 million and $3 million in accrued liabilities, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Liquefaction Supply Derivatives related to this agreement are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows (in millions, except notional amount):\nWe recorded the following amounts on our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 related to this agreement (in millions):\nNatural Gas Transportation and Storage Agreements\nSPL is party to various natural gas transportation and storage agreements and CTPL is party to an operational balancing agreement with a related party in the ordinary course of business for the operation of the SPL Project, with initial primary terms of up to 10 years with extension rights. We recorded operating and maintenance expense of $13 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and accrued liabilities of $4 million as of December 31, 2020 with this related party.\nOperation and Maintenance Service Agreements\nCheniere LNG O&M Services, LLC (\u201cO&M Services\u201d), our wholly owned subsidiary, provides the development, construction, operation and maintenance services to Midship Pipeline pursuant to agreements in which O&M Services receives an agreed upon fee and reimbursement of costs incurred. O&M Services recorded $9 million, $12 million and $12 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of other revenues and $2 million and $3 million of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for services provided to Midship Pipeline under these agreements.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC.

A reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate of 21% to our effective income tax rate is as follows:\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nSignificant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (in millions):\nBusiness interest expense carryforward\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act (\u201cthe CARES Act\u201d) was signed into law which provided numerous tax changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In general, the CARES Act was favorable to us because it increased the interest deductibility limit from 30% to 50% of adjusted taxable income in 2019 and 2020.\nOn September 14, 2020, the U.S Department of Treasury issued final and proposed regulations providing guidance on the business interest expense limitation under Section 163(j) of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, the regulations were favorable to us because they allow depreciation capitalized to inventory to be added back to adjusted taxable income from 2018 through 2021, for purposes of computing the allowable interest expense deduction. As permitted under the regulations, we intend to adopt them retroactively beginning with the tax year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe favorable changes brought about by the CARES Act and the final and proposed interest expense regulations allow us to fully deduct our current year business interest expense and all of our previously disallowed business interest expense carryforward.\nInternal Restructuring\nOn March 31, 2020 we executed an internal restructuring which simplified our legal entity structure, causing foreign income to flow directly to our U.S. tax return. As a result of the internal restructuring, a one-time $38 million deferred tax expense was recorded discretely during the first quarter of 2020.\nValuation Allowance\nFor the period ended December 31, 2020, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $190 million on certain state NOLs and federal capital loss carryforwards, for which we believe are more likely than not to expire before realization of the benefit. Our valuation allowance decreased by $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFor the period ended December 31, 2019, we weighed all of the positive and negative evidence, and determined that sufficient positive evidence existed to support releasing the valuation allowance against substantially all of our federal deferred tax assets and a portion of our state deferred tax assets. The positive evidence supporting such conclusion included successful completion and subsequent operations of Trains 1 and 2 of the CCL Project and Train 5 of the SPL Project, transitioning from a\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nthree-year cumulative loss position in 2018 to a three-year cumulative income position in 2019, commencing commercial delivery on 13 of our long-term customer SPAs and forecasts of sustained future profitability.\nNOL and tax credit carryforwards\nAt December 31, 2020, we had federal and state NOL carryforwards of approximately $15.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. Approximately $10.6 billion of these NOLs have an indefinite carryforward period. All other NOLs will expire between 2026 and 2040.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of $93 million and $2 million, respectively. The federal tax credit carryforwards include investment tax credit carryforwards of $52 million related to capital equipment placed in service at our Liquefaction Projects. We account for our federal investment tax credits under the flow-through method. The federal tax credit carryforwards also include $37 million of foreign tax credits related to tax years 2014 through 2020. The federal and state tax credit carryforwards will expire between 2024 and 2039.\nWe experienced an ownership change within the provisions of U.S. IRC Section 382 in 2008, 2010 and 2012. An analysis of the annual limitation on the utilization of our NOLs was performed in accordance with IRC Section 382. It was determined that IRC Section 382 will not limit the use of our NOLs over the carryover period. We continue to monitor trading activity in our shares which may cause an additional ownership change which could ultimately affect our ability to fully utilize our existing NOL carryforwards.\nIncome Tax Audits\nWe are subject to tax in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions and we remain subject to periodic audits and reviews by taxing authorities. Federal and state tax returns for the years after 2016 remain open for examination. Tax authorities may have the ability to review and adjust carryover attributes that were generated prior to these periods if utilized in an open tax year.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nAt December 31, 2020, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $62 million. If recognized, $53 million of unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate in future periods. Currently, we do not recognize any accrued liabilities, interest and penalties associated with the unrecognized tax benefits provided in our Consolidated Statements of Operations or our Consolidated Balance Sheets because any settlement of uncertain tax positions would result in an adjustment to our NOL carryforward. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of income tax expense.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of our unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, is as follows (in millions):\nNOTE 16-SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nWe have granted restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, performance stock units and phantom units to employees and non-employee directors under the 2011 Incentive Plan, as amended (the \u201c2011 Plan\u201d) and the 2020 Incentive Plan, which was approved by our shareholders in May 2020.

All performance conditions of the awards have been achieved as of December 31, 2020.\nThe table below provides a summary of our restricted stock outstanding (in millions, except for per share information):\nThe fair value of restricted stock share awards vested for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $3 million, $3 million and $53 million, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Unit and Performance Stock Unit Awards\nRestricted stock units are stock awards that vest over a service period of three years and entitle the holder to receive shares of our common stock upon vesting, subject to restrictions on transfer and to a risk of forfeiture if the recipient terminates employment with us prior to the lapse of the restrictions. Performance stock units provide for cliff vesting after a period of three years with payouts based on metrics dependent upon market and performance achieved over the defined performance period compared to pre-established performance targets. The settlement amounts of the awards are based on market and performance metrics which include cumulative distributable cash flow per share, and in certain circumstances, absolute total shareholder return (\u201cATSR\u201d) of our common stock. Where applicable, the compensation for performance stock units is based on fair value assigned to the market metric of ATSR using a Monte Carlo model upon grant, which remains constant through the vesting period, and a performance metric, which will vary due to changing estimates regarding the expected achievement of the performance metric of cumulative distributable cash flow per share. The number of shares that may be earned at the end of\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nthe vesting period ranges from 0% up to 300% of the target award amount. Both restricted stock units and performance stock units will be settled in Cheniere common stock (on a one-for-one basis) and are classified as equity awards.\nThe table below provides a summary of our restricted share unit and performance stock unit awards outstanding assuming payout at target for awards containing performance conditions (in millions, except for per unit information):\n(1) This number includes 0.2 million incremental shares of our common stock that were issued based on performance results from previously-granted performance stock unit awards.\n(2) This number excludes 1.0 million performance stock units, which represent the incremental number of common units that would be issued if the maximum level of performance under the target awards amount is achieved.\nThe table below provides a summary of restricted share unit and performance stock unit awards issued and fair value of units vested:\nPhantom Units Awards\nPhantom units are share-based awards granted to employees over a vesting period that entitle the grantee to receive the cash equivalent to the value of a share of our common stock upon each vesting. We did not issue any phantom units to our employees and non-employee directors during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Phantom units are not eligible to receive quarterly distributions. These awards vest based on service conditions (two, three or four-year service periods).\nThe table below provides a summary of our phantom units outstanding (in millions):\nThe value of phantom units vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $4 million, $11 million and $91 million, respectively.\nNOTE 17-EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN\nWe have a defined contribution plan (\u201c401(k) Plan\u201d) which allows eligible employees to contribute up to 75% of their compensation up to the IRS maximum. We match each employee\u2019s deferrals (contributions) up to 6% of compensation and may make additional contributions at our discretion. Employees are immediately vested in the contributions made by us. Our contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $15 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We have made no discretionary contributions to the 401(k) Plan to date.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nNOTE 18-NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS\nThe following table reconciles basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions, except per share data):\nPotentially dilutive securities that were not included in the diluted net income (loss) per share computations because their effects would have been anti-dilutive were as follows (in millions):\n(1)Does not include 0.5 million shares, 0.5 million shares and 0.4 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of unvested stock because the performance conditions had not yet been satisfied as of the respective dates.\n(2)Since we have the intent and ability to settle the remaining outstanding principal amount of the 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes in cash and the excess conversion premium (the \u201cconversion spread\u201d) in either cash or shares, the treasury stock method was applied for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2020. However, since the average market price of our common stock did not exceed the conversion price of our 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes, the conversion spread was excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(3)Since we redeemed the remaining principal amount of the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes and the related premium in cash, as described in Note 11-Debt, the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes were not included in the computation of net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2020. There were no shares related to the conversion of the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes included in the computation of diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2018, because the substantive non-market based contingencies underlying the eligible conversion date were not met as of December 31, 2018.\nNOTE 19-SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM\nOn June 3, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) authorized a 3-year, $1.0 billion share repurchase program. The following table presents information with respect to repurchases of common stock during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had up to $596 million of the share repurchase program available. Under the share repurchase program, repurchases can be made from time to time using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, all in accordance with the rules of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements. The timing and amount of any shares of our common stock that are repurchased under the share repurchase program will be determined by our management based on market conditions and other factors. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time or from time to time at our discretion.\nNOTE 20-COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nWe have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executed contracts which do not meet the definition of a liability as of December 31, 2020, are not recognized as liabilities but require disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLNG Terminal Commitments and Contingencies\nObligations under EPC Contracts\nSPL has a lump sum turnkey contract with Bechtel Oil, Gas and Chemicals, Inc.

As of December 31, 2020, we have incurred $1.9 billion under this contract.\nCCL has a lump sum turnkey contract with Bechtel for the engineering, procurement and construction of Train 3 of the CCL Project. The EPC contract price for Train 3 of the CCL Project is approximately $2.4 billion, reflecting amounts incurred under change orders through December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we have incurred $2.4 billion under this contract.\nSPL and CCL have the right to terminate its respective EPC contracts for its convenience, in which case Bechtel will be paid (1) the portion of the contract price for the work performed, (2) costs reasonably incurred by Bechtel on account of such termination and demobilization and (3) a lump sum of up to $30 million depending on the termination date.\nObligations under SPAs\nSPL and CCL have third-party SPAs which obligate SPL and CCL, respectively, to purchase and liquefy sufficient quantities of natural gas to deliver contracted volumes of LNG to the customers\u2019 vessels, subject to completion of construction of applicable specified Trains of the SPL Project or the CCL Project. In addition, our integrated marketing function has third-party SPAs which obligate us to deliver contracted volumes of LNG to the customers\u2019 vessels or to the customers at their LNG receiving terminals.\nObligations under LNG TUAs\nSPLNG has third-party TUAs with Total and Chevron U.S.A. Inc. to provide berthing for LNG vessels and for the unloading, storage and regasification of LNG at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal.\nObligations under Natural Gas Supply, Transportation and Storage Service Agreements\nSPL, CCL and CCL Stage III have physical natural gas supply contracts to secure natural gas feedstock for the SPL Project, the CCL Project and potential future development of Corpus Christi Stage 3, respectively. The remaining terms of these contracts range up to 15 years, some of which commence upon the satisfaction of certain events or states of affairs. As of December 31, 2020, SPL, CCL and CCL Stage III have secured up to approximately 4,950 TBtu, 2,938 TBtu and 2,361 TBtu, respectively, of natural gas feedstock through natural gas supply contracts, a portion of which are considered purchase obligations if the certain events or states of affairs are satisfied.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nAdditionally, SPL and CCL have natural gas transportation and storage service agreements for the SPL Project and the CCL Project, respectively. The initial terms of the natural gas transportation agreements range up to 20 years for the SPL Project and the CCL Project, with renewal options for certain contracts, and commence upon the occurrence of conditions precedent. The initial term of the natural gas storage service agreements for the SPL Project ranges up to 10 years and the initial term of the natural gas storage service agreements for the CCL Project ranges up to 5 years.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the obligations of SPL, CCL and CCL Stage III under natural gas supply, transportation and storage service agreements for contracts in which conditions precedent were met were as follows (in millions):\n(1)Pricing of natural gas supply contracts are variable based on market commodity basis prices adjusted for basis spread. Amounts included are based on estimated forward prices and basis spreads as of December 31, 2020. Some of our contracts may not have been negotiated as part of arranging financing for the underlying assets providing the natural gas supply, transportation and storage services.\nRestricted Net Assets\nAt December 31, 2020, our restricted net assets of consolidated subsidiaries were approximately $3.0 billion.\nOther Commitments\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have entered into certain multi-year licensing and service agreements, none of which are considered material to our financial position.\nEnvironmental and Regulatory Matters\nOur LNG terminals and pipelines are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state and local statutes, rules, regulations and laws. These laws require that we engage in consultations with appropriate federal and state agencies and that we obtain and maintain applicable permits and other authorizations. Failure to comply with such laws could result in legal proceedings, which may include substantial penalties. We believe that, based on currently known information, compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are, and may in the future be, involved as a party to various legal proceedings, which are incidental to the ordinary course of business. We regularly analyze current information and, as necessary, provide accruals for probable liabilities on the eventual disposition of these matters. While the results of these litigation matters and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the reasonably possible losses from such matters, individually and in the aggregate, are not material. Additionally, we believe the probable final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC.

Under this method, the assets and liabilities of affiliates are not consolidated. The investments in net assets of the affiliates are recorded on the Condensed Balance Sheets. The income from operations of the affiliates is reported on a net basis as investment in affiliates (equity in income of subsidiaries).\nA substantial amount of Cheniere\u2019s operating, investing and financing activities are conducted by its affiliates. The Condensed Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with Cheniere\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity. This guidance simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments primarily by eliminating the existing cash conversion and beneficial conversion models within Subtopic 470-20, which will result in fewer embedded conversion options being accounted for separately from the debt host. The guidance also amends and simplifies the calculation of earnings per share relating to convertible instruments. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within that reporting period, with earlier adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within that reporting period, using either a full or modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This guidance primarily provides temporary optional expedients which simplify the accounting for contract modifications to existing debt agreements expected to arise from the market transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates. The optional expedients were available to be used upon issuance of this guidance but we have not yet applied the guidance because we have not yet modified any of our existing contracts for reference rate reform. Once we apply an optional expedient to a modified contract and adopt this standard, the guidance will be applied to all subsequent applicable contract modifications until December 31, 2022, at which time the optional expedients are no longer available.\nSCHEDULE I-CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF REGISTRANT\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nNOTE 2-DEBT\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our debt consisted of the following (in millions):\nBelow is a schedule of future principal payments that we are obligated to make on our outstanding debt at December 31, 2020 (in millions):\nSCHEDULE I-CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF REGISTRANT\nCHENIERE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED\nIssuances and Repayments\nThe following table shows the issuances and repayments of debt during the year ended December 31, 2020 (in millions):\n(1)Proceeds of the 2028 Cheniere Senior Secured Notes, along with $200 million in available cash, were used to prepay approximately $2.1 billion of the outstanding indebtedness of the Cheniere Term Loan Facility, resulting in the recognition of debt extinguishment costs of $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The borrowings under the Cheniere Term Loan Facility, which was entered in June 2020 with available commitments of $2.62 billion and subsequently increased to $2.695 billion in July 2020, were used to (1) redeem the remaining outstanding principal amount of the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes with cash at a price of $1,080 per $1,000 principal amount, (2) repurchase $844 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes at individually negotiated prices from a small number of investors and (3) pay the related fees and expenses. The redemption of the 2025 CCH HoldCo II Convertible Senior Notes and the repurchase of the 2021 Cheniere Convertible Unsecured Notes resulted in the recognition of debt extinguishment costs of $149 million and a reduction in equity associated with reacquisition of the embedded conversion option of $10 million.\nNOTE 3-GUARANTEES\nCheniere has various financial and performance guarantees and indemnifications which are issued in the normal course of business.
