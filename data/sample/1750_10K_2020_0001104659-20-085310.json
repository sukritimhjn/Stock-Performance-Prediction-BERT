    "item_1": "ITEM 1.BUSINESS\nGeneral\nAAR CORP. and its subsidiaries are referred to herein collectively as \u201cAAR,\u201d \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d unless the context indicates otherwise. AAR was founded in 1951, organized in 1955 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1966. We are a diversified provider of products and services to the worldwide aviation and government and defense markets.\nFiscal 2020 began with strategic initiatives focused on growth and execution across all of our activities in the commercial and government markets. Our momentum from a successful fiscal 2019 carried into the new year as we saw continued strength in our parts supply activities, as well as in government programs. We also realized the positive impact our efforts to attract and retain talent had in our maintenance, repair and overhaul (\u201cMRO\u201d) activities.\nWe succeeded in enhancing customer relationships with multiple commercial and government customers. In fiscal 2020, we were awarded a new $118 million contract from the Naval Air Systems Command in support of the U.S. Marine Corps for the procurement, modification and delivery of two C-40 aircraft. This award demonstrates the power of our integrated services model by combining the strengths of our parts supply, government programs, MRO, and engineering teams to deliver a creative solution to the U.S. Marine Corps.\nWe were also awarded new long-term contracts across our parts supply activities including multiple distribution agreements for new parts and our largest commercial agreement in Japan to date covering aftermarket engine components. Our strategy to exit the capital-intensive Contractor-Owned, Contractor-Operated (\u201cCOCO\u201d) business was also completed in fiscal 2020 as all of its assets and contracts were sold.\nAs we continued to successfully execute on our recent contract awards over the last few years, we achieved strong sales growth through the first nine months of fiscal 2020 and were on track for a record year. Sales had increased $166.4 million or 11.2% over the prior year period primarily due to an increase in sales of $175.5 million or 12.5% in our Aviation Services segment reflecting the growth from new contract awards and successful execution across our Aviation Services activities.\nUpon entering the fourth quarter in March, we began to see the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the commercial aviation industry. In response to the impact from COVID-19, we implemented significant actions to reduce fixed costs and overhead which included a freeze on new hiring, reducing or eliminating all non-essential spend, reducing compensation and benefits, furloughs, a reduction in force, and closure of an airframe maintenance facility. During the fourth quarter, we also exited underperforming contracts and assets across our operations and decided to exit our joint venture investment in a Malaysian landing gear wheel and brake facility. Additionally, in June 2020, we decided to sell our composites manufacturing business which is consistent with our multi-year strategy to focus our portfolio on our core services offerings.\nWe have also taken actions to preserve flexibility in our liquidity. In the fourth quarter, we elected to draw down our remaining available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility with the majority of that additional funding remaining in our cash accounts. We elected to borrow these additional amounts as a precautionary measure in light of economic and market uncertainty presented by COVID-19.\nOver the long-term, we expect to see continued strength in our Aviation Services segment given its offerings of value-added services to both commercial and government and defense customers. We believe long-term commercial aftermarket growth trends are favorable although there is uncertainty in certain fleet types as commercial operators re-evaluate their structure. Our results of operations are affected by the amount of commercial aircraft flying and flight hours. The current COVID-19 pandemic has decreased the amount of commercial aircraft flying and flight hours and has created significant economic disruption.\nBusiness Segments\nAviation Services\nThe Aviation Services segment provides aftermarket support and services for the commercial aviation and government and defense markets and accounted for approximately 95% of our sales in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018. In this segment, we also provide inventory management and distribution services, MRO, and engineering services. Business activities in this segment are primarily conducted through AAR Supply Chain, Inc.; AAR Government Services, Inc.; AAR Aircraft & Engine Sales & Leasing, Inc.; AAR Aircraft Services, Inc.; AAR Allen Services, Inc.; AAR Landing Gear LLC; AAR Airlift Group, Inc.; and AAR International, Inc.\nWe sell and lease a wide variety of new, overhauled and repaired engine and airframe parts and components and aircraft to our commercial aviation and government/defense customers.\nWe provide customized flight hour component inventory and repair programs, warranty claim management, and outsourcing programs for engine and airframe parts and components in support of our airline and government customers\u2019 maintenance activities. The types of services provided under these programs include some or all of the following functions: material planning, sourcing, logistics, information and program management, and parts and component repair and overhaul. We are also an authorized distributor for more than 30 product lines which include parts from over 300 Federal Supply Class codes, which we source from over 25 leading aviation original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEM\u201ds).\nWe provide fleet management and operations of customer-owned aircraft for the U.S. Department of State (\u201cDoS\u201d) under the INL/A WASS contract. We are the prime contractor on this ten-year performance-based contract which began in fiscal 2018. Our services under the contract include operating and maintaining the global DoS fleet of fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft.\nWe also provide customized performance-based supply chain logistics programs in support of the U.S. Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d) and foreign governments. The types of services provided under these programs include some or all of the following functions: material planning, sourcing, logistics, information and program management, airframe maintenance and maintenance planning, and component repair and overhaul.\nWe provide major airframe inspection, maintenance, repair and overhaul, painting services, line maintenance, airframe modifications, structural repairs, avionics service and installation, exterior and interior refurbishment, and engineering services and support for many types of commercial and military aircraft. We also repair and overhaul various components, landing gears, wheels, and brakes for commercial and military aircraft.\nWe operate six airframe maintenance facilities and one landing gear overhaul facility. Our landing gear overhaul facility is in Miami, Florida, where we repair and overhaul landing gear, wheels, brakes, and actuators for different types of commercial and military aircraft. Our U.S. airframe maintenance facilities are in Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Miami, Florida; and Rockford, Illinois and our Canadian airframe maintenance facilities are in Trois Rivieres, Quebec and Windsor, Ontario. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we announced our decision to close our airframe maintenance hangar in Duluth, Minnesota as the facility was only supporting a single customer and its location was not convenient for many of our customers' route networks. We recognized pretax closure costs of $4.3 million in the fourth quarter primarily related to severance costs and asset impairment charges.\nIn addition to our North American facilities, we also have an interest in a joint venture to develop and operate an airframe maintenance facility in India. The facility construction is expected to be completed in fiscal 2021.\nThe majority of our product sales are made pursuant to standard commercial purchase orders. Government sales are generally made under standard types of government contracts, which can include firm fixed-price contracts, cost plus fixed fee contracts, and time-and-materials contracts. For cost plus fixed fee contracts, we typically receive reimbursement of our costs, to the extent the costs are allowable under contractual and regulatory provisions, in addition to receiving a fixed fee. Some of our contracts call for the performance of specified services or the delivery of specified products under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (\u201cID/IQ\u201d) arrangements. Certain inventory supply and management and performance-based logistics program agreements reflect negotiated terms and conditions.\nTo support activities within the Aviation Services segment, we acquire aviation parts and components from domestic and foreign airlines, independent aviation service companies, aircraft leasing companies, and OEMs. We have ongoing arrangements with OEMs that provide us access to parts, repair manuals, and service bulletins in support of parts manufactured by them. Although the terms of each arrangement vary, they typically are made on standard OEM terms as to duration, price, and delivery. From time to time, we purchase airframes and engines for disassembly into individual parts and components. Airframes and engines may also be leased to airlines on a short-term basis prior to disassembly or sale.\nExpeditionary Services\nThe Expeditionary Services segment primarily consists of businesses that provide products and services supporting the movement of equipment and personnel by the U.S. and foreign governments and non-governmental organizations. The Expeditionary Services segment accounted for approximately 5% of our sales in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018. Business activities in this segment are primarily conducted through AAR Manufacturing, Inc. and Brown International Corporation.\nWe design, manufacture, and repair transportation pallets and a wide variety of containers and shelters used in support of military and humanitarian tactical deployment activities. The containers and shelters are used in numerous mission requirements, including armories, supply and parts storage, refrigeration systems, tactical operation centers, briefing rooms, laundry and kitchen facilities, water treatment, and sleeping quarters. Shelters include both stationary and vehicle-mounted applications.We also provide engineering, design, and system integration services for specialized command and control systems.\nWe also design and manufacture advanced composite materials for commercial, business and military aircraft (\u201cComposites\u201d). On June 23, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Composites business as this divestiture is consistent with our multi-year strategy to focus our portfolio on our core services offerings. We expect the sale to close in the third quarter of calendar 2020 and will recognize a charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 of approximately $20 million in conjunction with the transaction.\nSales in this segment are generally made to customers pursuant to standard commercial purchase orders and contracts. Government sales are generally made under standard types of government contracts, which can include firm fixed-price contracts, cost plus fixed fee contracts, and time-and-materials contracts. Some of our contracts call for the performance of specified services or the delivery of specified products under ID/IQ arrangements, however, the majority of our products and services are procured via definite contracts.\nRaw Materials\nAlthough we generated approximately 55% of our fiscal 2020 sales from the sale of products, we are generally engaged in only limited manufacturing activities and have minimal exposure to fluctuations in both the availability and pricing of raw materials. We purchase raw materials for our manufacturing operations, including steel, aluminum, extrusions, balsa, and other necessary supplies from several vendors. Where necessary, we have been able to obtain raw materials and other inventory items from numerous sources for each segment at competitive prices, terms, and conditions, and we expect to be able to continue to do so.\nTerms of Sale\nWe generally sell our products and services under standard 30-day payment terms. On occasion, certain customers will negotiate extended payment terms of 60-90 days. Except for customary warranty provisions, customers neither have the right to return products nor do they have the right to extended financing. Our government contracts may extend several years and include one or more base years and one or more option years. The government generally has the right not to exercise options to extend or expand our contracts and may otherwise terminate, cancel, or modify some contracts at its convenience.\nCustomers\nThe principal customers for our products and services in the Aviation Services segment are domestic and foreign passenger airlines, domestic and foreign cargo airlines, regional and commuter airlines, business and general aviation operators, OEMs, aircraft leasing companies, aftermarket aviation support companies, the DoD and its contractors, the DoS, and foreign military organizations or governments. In the Expeditionary Services segment, our principal customers include the DoD and its contractors, foreign military organizations or governments, defense organizations, and OEMs.\nSales of aviation products and services to our commercial airline customers are generally affected by such factors as the number, type and average age of aircraft in service, the levels of aircraft utilization (e.g., frequency of schedules, flying hours, and take-off and landing cycles), the number of airline operators, the general economy, and the level of sales of new and used aircraft. Sales to the DoD and other government agencies are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop deployment worldwide, government funding, competitive bidding, and requirements generated by worldwide geopolitical events.\nWe primarily market and sell products and services through our own employees. In certain markets outside of the United States, we rely on foreign sales representatives to assist in the sale of our products and services.\nSales to Government and Defense Customers\nSales to global government and defense customers (including sales to branches, agencies, and departments of the U.S. government) were $778.8 million (37.6% of consolidated sales), $677.9 million (33.0% of consolidated sales) and $428.9 million (24.5% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Sales to branches, agencies, and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $668.2 million (32.2% of consolidated sales), $546.2 million (26.6% of consolidated sales) and $304.3 million (17.4% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nSales to government and defense customers are reported in each of our reportable segments (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Since such sales are subject to competitive bidding and government funding, no assurance can be given that such sales will continue at levels previously experienced. The majority of our U.S. government sales are for products and services supporting the DoD logistics and mobility strategy and supporting DoS flight operations. Thus, our government contracts have changed, and may continue to change, with fluctuations in defense and other governmental agency spending and requirements. Our government contracts are also often subject to termination for convenience by the customer; in the event of such a termination, we are contractually entitled to recover all allowable costs incurred by us through the date of termination.\nGovernment Regulation and Certificates\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d) regulates the manufacture, repair, and operation of all aircraft and aircraft parts operated in the United States. Similar rules and regulatory authorities exist in other countries. The inspection, maintenance and repair procedures for the various types of aircraft and equipment are prescribed by these regulatory authorities and can be performed only by certified repair facilities utilizing certified technicians. The FAA requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft engines, certain engine parts, and airframes at regular intervals based on take off and landing cycles or flight time. Our businesses, which sell defense products and services directly to the U.S. government or through its contractors, can be subject to various laws and regulations governing pricing and other factors.\nWe have 12 FAA certificated repair stations in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Of the 12 certificated FAA repair stations, seven are also European Aviation Safety Agency (\u201cEASA\u201d) and three are also Transport Canada Civil Aviation (\u201cTCCA\u201d) certificated repair stations. Such certificates, which are ongoing in duration, are required for us to perform authorized maintenance, repair, and overhaul services for our customers and are subject to revocation by the government for non-compliance with applicable regulations. Of the 12 FAA certificated repair stations, 11 are in the Aviation Services segment and one is held by Composites included in our Expeditionary Services segment, which is expected to be sold in third quarter of calendar 2020. The EASA and TCCA certificated repair stations are in the Aviation Services segment. We also have a FAR Part 135 certificate to operate aircraft, although the certificate is not active. We believe that we possess all licenses and certifications that are material to the conduct of our business.\nCompetition\nCompetition in each of our markets is based on quality, ability to provide a broad range of products and services, speed of delivery, and price. Competitors in our Aviation Services segment include OEMs, the service divisions of large commercial airlines, and other independent suppliers of parts, repair, and overhaul services to the commercial and defense markets. Our Expeditionary Services segment competes with a number of divisions of large corporations and other large and small companies. Although certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, we believe that we have maintained a satisfactory competitive position through our responsiveness to customer needs, our attention to quality, and our unique combination of market expertise and technical and financial capabilities.\nBacklog\nBacklog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to derive from unshipped orders or signed contracts. Backlog includes our remaining performance obligations based on the transaction price of firm orders for which work has not yet been performed as of May 31, 2020. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under contracts such as ID/IQ contracts.\nAt May 31, 2020, our firm backlog was approximately $1.0 billion and we expect that approximately 50% of this backlog will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, with the majority of the remaining balance recognized as revenue over the next three years.\nEmployees\nAt May 31, 2020, we employed approximately 5,400 employees worldwide, with approximately 1,200 of these employees on furlough as of that date due to our actions to mitigate the impact from COVID-19. Approximately 200 of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We also retained approximately 170 contract workers as of May 31, 2020, the majority of whom are located at our airframe maintenance facilities. We retain these contract workers as they provide unique skill sets which are necessary at certain facilities as well as mitigate demand variability with our customers.\nAvailable Information\nFor additional information concerning our business segments, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cBusiness Segment Information\u201d in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nOur internet address is www.aarcorp.com.

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nThe following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business.\nWe are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.\nAs a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions of that industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high fuel and oil prices, lack of capital, and weak economic conditions. As a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. The impact of instability in the global financial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limited their ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft.\nA reduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additional airline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tight credit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including the following:\n\u25cf deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;\n\u25cf reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;\n\u25cf retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;\n\u25cf reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;\n\u25cf increased in-house maintenance by airlines;\n\u25cf lack of parts in the marketplace;\n\u25cf acts of terrorism;\n\u25cf future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and\n\u25cf acts of God.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has had a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity, and the duration and extent of the pandemic could prolong or increase the adverse impact.\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. Many countries, including the United States, have declared states of emergency and taken steps to restrict air travel, and many companies have adopted policies prohibiting non-essential business travel by their employees. Even in the absence of formal restrictions and prohibitions, contagious illness and fear of contagion has adversely affected travel demand and travel behavior. Passenger airline traffic has declined significantly since March 2020, and the decrease had a material negative impact on the financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect to continue to see reduced demand in our non-cargo commercial businesses. Moreover, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in decreased worldwide commercial activity, it could also adversely affect the demand for airline cargo services. Reduced numbers of aircraft flying or flight hours negatively impacts the demand for our services, and any prolonged reduction could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.\nIn addition, we source parts and components for our business from various suppliers around the world. Disruptions to our supply chain and business operations, or to our suppliers\u2019 or customers\u2019 supply chains and business operations, could have adverse effects on our ability to provide aftermarket support and services. Moreover, a prolonged epidemic or pandemic, or the threat thereof, could result in worker absences, lower productivity, voluntary closure of our offices and facilities, travel restrictions for our employees and other disruptions to our business. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company has taken a number of actions in response to decreased demand. In addition to reducing operating expenditures for fiscal 2021 (including by implementing furloughs, eliminating certain employee and contractor positions, temporarily reducing senior employee and director compensation, consolidating facilities and eliminating non-essential spending), we have taken steps to improve our liquidity, including drawing down our Revolving Credit Facility and seeking financial assistance under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d). Certain subsidiaries of the Company have been approved to receive $57.2 million from the U.S. Treasury Department (\u201cTreasury\u201d) through the Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act. In connection with the financial assistance these subsidiaries expect to receive under the Payroll Support Program, they will be required to comply with certain provisions of the CARES Act, including the requirement that funds provided pursuant to the Payroll Support Program be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of employee wages, salaries and benefits; the requirement against involuntary terminations and furloughs and reductions in employee pay rates and benefits from the signing date of the Payroll Support Program agreement through September 30, 2020. In addition, those subsidiaries and the Company would be subject to provisions prohibiting the repurchase of common stock and the payment of common stock dividends through September 30, 2021; and limitations on the payment of certain employee compensation through March 24, 2022. These restrictions will materially affect the Company\u2019s operations, and the Company may not be successful in managing these impacts for the duration of the restrictions. In particular, limitations on compensation may adversely impact the Company's ability to attract and retain senior management or attract other key employees during this critical time. Although the Company has submitted what it believes to be final CARES Act documents to Treasury for counter signature, we can provide no assurance as to the final timing, terms or receipt of any funds.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, any of which could have a material effect on us.\nOur U.S. government contracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $668.2 million (32.2% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2020 (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government sales is for products and services supporting DoD logistics and mobility strategy and DoS flight operations and are, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding and spending. Our contracts with the U.S. government and their contractors are typically agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of the government customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop deployment worldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints.\nU.S. government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation, including the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt. These issues could negatively affect the timely collection of our U.S. government invoices.\nFuture congressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular.\nIf there are funding delays and constraints, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn light of COVID-19, and the corresponding decrease in commercial airline activity, we anticipate that the percentage of our revenue that comes from government contracts will increase and become more important to our overall business, which would heighten the adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition of any reduction in the sales levels of our U.S. government contracts.\nIf we fail to comply with government procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions.\nWe must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and orders restricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information and safeguarding of contractor information systems.\nIn addition, we are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under government contracts. U.S. government agencies routinely audit government contractors to review performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and compliance with internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract are not reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Also, any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in payments being withheld, penalties and reduced future business.\nU.S. government rules allow contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels if a contracting officer determines that one or more of a contractor\u2019s business systems have one or more significant deficiencies. If a contracting officer were to impose such a withholding on us or even one of our prime contractors, it would increase the risk that we would not be paid in full or paid timely. If future audit adjustments exceed our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nIf a government inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including contract termination, fines, forfeiture of fees, suspension of payment and suspension or debarment from doing business with government agencies, any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about certain pending proceedings.\nWe use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts and face risks of cost overruns and losses on these contracts.\nWe sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing for fixed unit prices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, and other unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results. Increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe recognize revenue on our long-term contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as the services are delivered, which generally requires estimates of total costs at completion, fees earned on the contract, or both. This estimation process is complex and involves significant judgment related to assumptions on flight hours, component repair costs, labor hours and rates, and contract penalties and incentives. Adjustments to estimates are often required as work progresses, experience is gained and additional information becomes known, even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change. Any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized as events become known. Changes in the underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect our future financial results.\nIf our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our contract profitability and our ability to win new contracts may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on subcontractors to perform a portion of the services we agree to provide our customers, and our suppliers provide necessary inventory and component parts. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon services or supplies may affect our ability to perform our contractual obligations. Deficiencies in the performance of our subcontractors and/or suppliers could result in liquidated damages or our customer terminating our contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability and adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to win new contract awards.\nWe are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to comply with new or more stringent governmental regulation.\nThe aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Before we sell any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country; although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us.\nIf any of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nSuccess at our airframe maintenance facilities is dependent upon continued outsourcing by the airlines.\nWe currently perform airframe maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities at six leased locations. Revenues at these facilities fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. In addition, certain airlines operate certain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nor technicians trained and certified to perform the required airframe maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute our operational and financial plans at our maintenance, repair, and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.\nOur business has historically been dependent on educated and skilled aviation mechanics because of the complex nature of many of our products and services. Furthermore, we have a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 200 employees. Beginning in April 2020, we furloughed a significant portion of our skilled workforce as a result of the negative impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the demand for our services. Although we are taking measures to maintain good relationships with our workforce, including by paying the employer and employee portion of the furloughed employees\u2019 health insurance costs, there can be no assurance that the act of furloughing our employees will not damage employee relations or cause employees to seek work elsewhere. Should the demand for skilled personnel return to pre-COVID-19 levels, and if we are unable to quickly reassemble our skilled workforce and subsequently retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, or we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage in such an environment, our ability to secure new work and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us.\nThe markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we face competition from a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service companies, other companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. These competitive markets also create pressure on our ability to hire and retain qualified technicians and other skilled labor needs. We believe that our ability to compete depends on superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing, and effective quality assurance programs.\nOur government customers, including the DoD and DoS, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize set asides such as small business, women-owned, or minority-owned contractors or determine to source work internally rather than use us. We are also impacted by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards and task orders. Bid protests could result in significant expense for us, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings. These competitive pressures, with potential impacts on both our commercial and government business, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.\nWe conduct our business in a number of foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts. Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:\n\u25cf military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks;\n\u25cf export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;\n\u25cf compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about certain pending proceedings;\n\u25cf the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;\n\u25cf contract award and funding delays;\n\u25cf potential restrictions on transfers of funds;\n\u25cf import and export duties and value added taxes;\n\u25cf foreign exchange risk;\n\u25cf transportation delays and interruptions, including the inability to move personnel out of foreign jurisdictions due to COVID-19 travel restrictions;\n\u25cf uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and\n\u25cf changes in U.S. policies on trade relations and trade policy, including implementation of or changes in trade sanctions, tariffs, and embargoes.\nOn January 31, 2020, the UK officially exited the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and entered a transition period during which it remains bound by EU rules and trade policy. There is significant uncertainty regarding the terms and the future relationship between the UK and the EU following the transition period. Potential adverse consequences of the UK\u2019s exit include global market uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and other countries and increased regulatory complexities.\nWhile we have adopted and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, such measures may not be adequate, and the regions in which we operate might not continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all.\nAcquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses.\nWe have completed acquisitions in the past few years and we have discussions with third parties regarding acquisitions on a regular basis. Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. For any businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial, or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMarket values for our aviation products fluctuate and we may be unable to recover our costs incurred on engines, rotable components and other aircraft parts.\nWe make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of rotable components, engines, and other assets which are on lease, available for lease, or supporting our long-term programs. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Reductions in demand for these assets or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our aircraft, engines, and other assets, could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may need to reduce the carrying value of our assets.\nWe own and distribute a significant amount of engines, aircraft parts and components, as well as own manufacturing facilities and joint venture investments. Recurring losses in certain operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of the related assets and recognize an impairment charge through earnings to reduce the carrying value. During fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, we recognized impairment charges of $11.8 million, $74.1 million, and $54.2 million, respectively, related to our COCO business which is classified as a discontinued operation. In addition, if aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline. We recognized impairment charges of $11.0 million in fiscal 2020 related to the exit of certain product lines across our operations.\nWe make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of our assets, including historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our assets could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $9.8 million related to our COCO business. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or if a regulator were to terminate any of our repair certificates at our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilities, we might be required to record an impairment charge if we were unable to operate.\nWe are dependent upon continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute our business strategy, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us.\nOur ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debt and equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, state of the aviation industry, our financial performance, and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nLIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. Interest rates under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) are based partly on LIBOR. LIBOR is currently expected to phase out by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate which is currently intended to serve as an alternative reference rate to LIBOR. If the method for calculation of LIBOR changes, if LIBOR is no longer available or if lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may suffer from potential increases in interest rates on our borrowings. Further, we may need to renegotiate our credit facilities or any other borrowings that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established.\nOur existing debt and expected government funding includes restrictive and/or financial covenants.\nCertain financing arrangements, including our Revolving Credit Facility and our accounts receivable financing program, require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan and debt agreements and may result in a cross-default under other debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our expected receipt of funding under Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act would require us to comply with certain covenants. If we do not comply with these covenants, the government may require us to repay the support given to us.\nWe may not be able to pay or maintain dividends, or we may choose not to pay dividends, and the failure to pay or maintain dividends may adversely affect our share price.\nOn March 17, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share, or an aggregate of $2.6 million, which was paid on April 9, 2020 to holders of record on March 30, 2020. This dividend may not be indicative of the amount of any future quarterly dividends. Specifically, the Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act prohibits the Company from paying stock dividends through September 30, 2021, accordingly no dividend will be paid by the Company prior to that time assuming the receipt of funding.\nAfter the restrictions on paying the dividend under the CARES Act lapse, our ability to pay, maintain or increase cash dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including: our ability to comply with financial covenants, the economic condition of the commercial aviation industry, the level and timing of capital expenditures, principal repayments and other capital needs, maintaining our credit ratings, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and legal restrictions on the payment of dividends, including government imposed restrictions. In the future, we may choose to not pay dividends or may not be able to pay dividends, maintain our current level of dividends, or increase them over time. The failure to maintain or pay dividends may adversely affect our share price.\nOur industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately covered by insurance may adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death, which may result if an engine, engine part or component, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product that we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced, or in which our products are installed, has an accident. We carry substantial liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate for our risk exposure and commensurate with industry norms. However, claims may arise in the future, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.\nOur business depends heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. The Company's systems and technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyber threats, ransomware attacks, terrorist acts, natural disasters, power failures or other causes. These threats arise in some cases as a result of our role as a defense contractor.\nCyber security threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, business e-mail compromises, ransomware attacks, and other electronic security breaches, including at our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data.\nThe procedures and controls we utilize to monitor and mitigate these threats may not be sufficient to prevent security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results, and financial condition.\nMoreover, expenditures incurred in implementing and maintaining cyber security and other procedures and controls could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmental liabilities may adversely affect us.\nFederal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were required to pay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture environmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues, such as climate change, could adversely affect our operations and increase operating costs and, through their impact on our customers, reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the United States, foreign governments, or the International Civil Aviation Organization to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry. The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits.\nWe may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment, and methods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pace with any new technological developments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.",

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nNotes:\n1At the beginning of fiscal 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d) using a modified retrospective method and, as a result, the comparative information for prior years has not been restated and is reported under accounting standards in effect for those years. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n2In fiscal 2020, we recognized contract termination and restructuring charges of $31.3 across certain commercial power-by-the-hour contracts. The charges included a reduction in revenue of $17.3 million, the establishment of forward loss reserves of $5.4 million, and other related charges of $8.6 million. During fiscal 2020, we also recognized impairment charges of $11.0 million related to the exit of certain product lines across our operations and $4.9 million related to the closure of two facilities. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, we reduced our headcount and furloughed employees resulting in the recognition of severance and furlough costs of $5.0 million in fiscal 2020.\n3In fiscal 2016, we received contingent consideration from the sale of Telair Cargo Group and recognized a pre-tax gain of $27.7 million.\nWe recognized pre-tax asset impairment charges related to our Contractor-Owned, Contractor-Operated (\u201cCOCO\u201d) business of $11.8 million, $74.1 million, and $64.0 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n4In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we elected to draw down our Revolving Credit Facility as a precautionary measure in light of economic and market uncertainty presented by COVID-19.

    "item_7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Dollars in millions)\nBackground and Forward-Looking Statements\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Form 10-K, as well as Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2019, which provides additional information on comparisons of fiscal 2019 and 2018.\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain certain statements relating to future results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions and estimates based on information available to us as of the dates such assumptions and estimates are made, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those factors discussed under Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Should one or more of those risks or uncertainties materialize adversely, or should underlying assumptions or estimates prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described. Those events and uncertainties are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many are beyond our control. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.\nGeneral Overview\nWe report our activities in two business segments: Aviation Services comprised of supply chain and maintenance, repair and overhaul (\u201cMRO\u201d) activities and Expeditionary Services comprised of manufacturing activities.\nThe Aviation Services segment consists of aftermarket support and services offerings that provide spare parts and maintenance support for aircraft operated by our commercial and government/defense customers. Sales in the Aviation Services segment are derived from the sale and lease of a wide variety of new, overhauled and repaired engine and airframe parts and components to the commercial aviation and government and defense markets. We provide customized inventory supply chain management, performance based logistics programs, customer fleet management and operations, and aircraft component repair management services. The segment also includes repair, maintenance and overhaul of aircraft, landing gear and components. Cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product, direct labor, and overhead.\nThe Expeditionary Services segment consists of primarily manufacturing operations with sales derived from the design and manufacture of pallets, shelters, and containers used to support the U.S. military\u2019s requirements for a mobile and agile force including engineering, design, and system integration services for specialized command and control systems. This segment also designs and manufactures advanced composite materials for commercial, business and military aircraft. Cost of sales consists principally of the cost of material to manufacture products, direct labor and overhead.\nOur chief operating decision making officer (Chief Executive Officer) evaluates performance based on the reportable segments and utilizes gross profit as a primary profitability measure. Gross profit is calculated by subtracting cost of sales from sales. The assets and certain expenses related to corporate activities are not allocated to the segments. Our reportable segments are aligned principally around differences in products and services.\nBusiness Trends and Outlook\nFiscal 2020 began with strategic initiatives focused on growth and execution across all of our activities in the commercial and government markets. Our momentum from a successful fiscal 2019 carried into the new year as we saw continued strength in our parts supply activities, as well as in government programs. We also realized the positive impact our efforts to attract and retain talent had in our MRO activities.\nWe succeeded in enhancing customer relationships with multiple commercial and government customers. In fiscal 2020, we were awarded a new $118 million contract from the Naval Air Systems Command in support of the U.S. Marine Corps for the procurement, modification and delivery of two C-40 aircraft. This award demonstrates the power of our integrated services model by combining the strengths of our parts supply, government programs, MRO, and engineering teams to deliver a creative solution to the U.S. Marine Corps.\nWe were also awarded new long-term contracts across our parts supply activities including multiple distribution agreements for new parts and our largest commercial agreement in Japan to date covering aftermarket engine components. Our strategy to exit the capital-intensive Contractor-Owned, Contractor-Operated (\u201cCOCO\u201d) business was also completed in fiscal 2020 as all of its assets and contracts were sold.\nAs we continued to successfully execute on our recent contract awards over the last few years, we achieved strong sales growth through the first nine months of fiscal 2020 and were on track for a record year. Sales had increased $166.4 million or 11.2% over the prior year period primarily due to an increase in sales of $175.5 million or 12.5% in our Aviation Services segment reflecting the growth from new contract awards and successful execution across our Aviation Services activities.\nUpon entering the fourth quarter in March, we began to see the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the commercial aviation industry. In response to the impact from COVID-19, we implemented significant actions to reduce fixed costs and overhead which included a freeze on new hiring, reducing or eliminating all non-essential spend, reducing compensation and benefits, furloughs, a reduction in force, and closure of an airframe maintenance facility. During the fourth quarter, we also exited underperforming contracts and assets across our operations and decided to exit our joint venture investment in a Malaysian landing gear wheel and brake facility. Additionally, in June 2020, we decided to sell our composites manufacturing business which is consistent with our multi-year strategy to focus our portfolio on our core services offerings.\nWe have also taken actions to preserve flexibility in our liquidity. In the fourth quarter, we elected to draw down our remaining available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility with the majority of that additional funding remaining in our cash accounts. We elected to borrow these additional amounts as a precautionary measure in light of economic and market uncertainty presented by COVID-19.\nOver the long-term, we expect to see continued strength in our Aviation Services segment given its offerings of value-added services to both commercial and government and defense customers. We believe long-term commercial aftermarket growth trends are favorable although there is uncertainty in certain fleet types as commercial operators re-evaluate their structure. Our results of operations are affected by the amount of commercial aircraft flying and flight hours. The current COVID-19 pandemic has decreased the amount of commercial aircraft flying and flight hours and has created significant economic disruption.\nResults of Operations - Fiscal 2020 Compared with Fiscal 2019\nSales and gross profit for our two business segments for the two years ended May 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nAviation Services Segment\nSales in the Aviation Services segment increased $43.6 million or 2.3% over the prior year. Sales to government and defense customers increased $117.0 million or 20.2% primarily attributable to new contracts awarded recently, including the $118 million contract for the procurement, modification and delivery of two C-40 aircraft we received in early fiscal 2020.\nDuring fiscal 2020, sales in this segment to commercial customers decreased $73.4 million or 5.5% from the prior year. We experienced an increase in sales to commercial customers of 7.2% over the first nine months of the year primarily due to higher volumes in our MRO activities as our actions to attract and retain the necessary skilled labor allowed us to capture the customer demand for these services. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the impact from COVID-19 significantly decreased our commercial sales across the majority of our operations.\nChanges in estimates and assumptions related to our programs accounted for using the cost-to-cost method are recorded using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. In fiscal 2020, we recognized favorable and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $6.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively, compared to favorable and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $8.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively, in fiscal 2019. When considering these adjustments on a net basis, we recognized favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $3.9 million and $5.9 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. These adjustments primarily relate to our long-term programs where we provide component inventory management and/or repair services.\nCost of sales in Aviation Services increased $89.9 million or 5.6% from the prior year which was largely in line with the sales increase of 2.3% discussed above. Gross profit in the Aviation Services segment decreased $46.3 million or 14.8% from the prior year. Gross profit in this segment on sales to commercial customers decreased $47.7 million or 24.4% from the prior year primarily driven by contract termination and restructuring charges of $31.3 million across certain power-by-the-hour contracts in fiscal 2020. The charges included a reduction in revenue of $17.3 million, the establishment of forward loss reserves of $5.4 million, and other related charges of $8.6 million. During fiscal 2020, we also recognized impairment charges of $6.9 million related to the exit of certain product lines across our operations and $4.3 million related to the closure of our Duluth airframe maintenance facility.\nThe gross profit margin on sales to commercial customers was 11.7% compared to 14.6% in the prior year with the decreased margin largely attributable to contract termination, restructuring, and impairment charges discussed above.\nGross profit on sales to government and defense customers increased $1.4 million or 1.2% over the prior year. Gross profit margin on sales to government and defense customers decreased to 17.2% from 20.4% as the gross profit margin on our recent contract awards is lower than our existing government and defense activity.\nExpeditionary Services Segment\nSales in the Expeditionary Services segment decreased $23.4 million or 17.8% from the prior year primarily due to delays in contract awards for our mobility products. Gross profit in the Expeditionary Services segment decreased $14.3 million or 88.3% from the prior year and gross profit margin decreased to 1.8% from 12.3% both primarily as a result of restructuring actions and lower sales volumes. During fiscal 2020, we consolidated our mobility products operations into one core facility and exited certain product lines as part of the consolidation. We recognized charges of $2.8 million related to facility closure costs and impairment charges.\nProvision for Doubtful Accounts\nProvision for doubtful accounts decreased $10.4 million from the prior year primarily related to fewer bankruptcy charges in fiscal 2020. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we recognized a provision for doubtful accounts of $12.4 million related to the bankruptcy of a European airline customer. The provision included impairment of non-current contract assets of $7.6 million, allowance for doubtful accounts of $3.3 million, and other liabilities of $1.5 million.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $5.2 million over the prior year. As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at 10.6% in fiscal 2020 compared to 10.5% in the prior year.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $0.2 million in fiscal 2020 as the impact of higher average borrowings was more than offset by lower average borrowing rates on our Revolving Credit Facility.\nIncome Taxes\nOur fiscal 2020 effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 18.4% compared to 5.5% in the prior year. In fiscal 2019, we recognized tax benefits of $5.1 million related to the reversal of certain state valuation allowances based on the recoverability of the net operating losses and other state deferred tax assets. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2019 also includes a benefit of $4.7 million related to the recognition of previously unrecognized uncertain tax positions and a tax benefit of $1.8 million related to tax provision to federal income tax return filing differences.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we decided to pursue the sale of our COCO business previously included in our Expeditionary Services segment. Due to this strategic shift, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of our COCO business were reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nLoss from discontinued operations was $20.4 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $76.6 million in the prior year. The reduced loss of $56.2 million was primarily due to lower pre-tax impairment charges of $11.8 million in fiscal 2020 as compared to $74.1 million in fiscal 2019.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position\nOur operating activities are funded and commitments met through the generation of cash from operations. In addition to operations, our current capital resources include an unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and an accounts receivable financing program. Periodically, we may also raise capital through common stock and debt financings in the public or private markets. We continually evaluate various financing arrangements, including the issuance of common stock or debt, which would allow us to improve our liquidity position and finance future growth on commercially reasonable terms. Our continuing ability to borrow from our lenders and issue debt and equity securities to the public and private markets in the future may be negatively affected by a number of factors, including the overall health of the credit markets, general economic conditions, airline industry conditions, geo-political events, and our operating performance. Our ability to generate cash from operations is influenced primarily by our operating performance and changes in working capital.\nWe maintain a Revolving Credit Facility with various financial institutions, as lenders, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders. On September 25, 2019, we entered into an amendment to our Revolving Credit Facility which extended the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility to September 25, 2024, increased the revolving credit commitment by $100 million to $600 million, and modified certain other provisions. Under certain circumstances, we have the ability to request, but our lenders are not required to grant, an increase to the revolving credit commitment by an aggregate amount of up to $300 million.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the offered Eurodollar Rate plus 87.5 to 175 basis points based on certain financial measurements if a Eurodollar Rate loan, or at the offered fluctuating Base Rate plus 0 to 75 basis points based on certain financial measurements if a Base Rate loan.\nBorrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at May 31, 2020 were $579.5 million and there were approximately $19.9 million of outstanding letters of credit, which reduced the availability of this facility to $0.6 million. There are no other terms or covenants limiting the availability of this facility. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we elected to draw down our Revolving Credit Facility as a precautionary measure in light of economic and market uncertainty presented by COVID-19. These additional borrowings from our Revolving Credit Facility are largely being maintained in Cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheet which was $404.7 million at May 31, 2020.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) was enacted in the U.S. in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain of our subsidiaries expect to receive $57.2 million from the U.S. Treasury Department through the Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act. These funds will be used to pay for the salaries and benefits of certain of those subsidiaries\u2019 employees. Of the $57.2 million total amount we expect to receive, approximately $48.5 million will be a direct grant and approximately $8.7 million will be in the form of a low interest 10-year senior unsecured promissory note.\nAs of May 31, 2020, we also had other financing arrangements that did not limit availability on our Revolving Credit Facility including outstanding letters of credit of $11.6 million and foreign lines of credit of $9.3 million.\nOn October 18, 2017, we entered into the Credit Agreement with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, as lender. The Credit Agreement provided a Canadian $31 million term loan with the proceeds used to fund the acquisition of two maintenance, repair, and overhaul facilities in Canada from Premier Aviation. The term loan is due in full at the expiration of the Credit Agreement on November 1, 2021 unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. Interest is payable monthly on the term loan at the offered fluctuating Canadian Dollar Offer Rate plus 125 to 225 basis points based on certain financial measurements if a Bankers\u2019 Acceptances loan, or at the offered fluctuating Prime Rate plus 25 to 125 basis points based on certain financial measurements, if a Prime Rate loan.\nOn February 23, 2018, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Citibank N.A. (\u201cPurchaser\u201d) for the sale, from time to time, of certain accounts receivable due from certain customers (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d). Under the Purchase Agreement, the maximum amount of receivables sold is limited to $150 million and Purchaser may, but is not required to, purchase the eligible receivables we offer to sell. The term of the Purchase Agreement runs through February 22, 2021, however, the Purchase Agreement may also be terminated earlier under certain circumstances. The term of the Purchase Agreement shall be automatically extended for annual terms unless either party provides advance notice that they do not intend to extend the term.\nWe have no retained interests in the sold receivables, other than limited recourse obligations in certain circumstances, and only perform collection and administrative functions for the Purchaser. We account for these receivable transfers as sales under ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, and de-recognize the sold receivables from our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nReceivables sold under the Purchase Agreement during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $746.4 million, $744.2 million, and $239.6, respectively. Amounts remitted to the Purchaser on their behalf during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $758.3 million, $729.7 million, and $167.9, respectively. As of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, we had collected cash of $20.0 million and $19.8 million, respectively, which was not yet remitted to the Purchaser as of those dates and was classified as Restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAt May 31, 2020, we complied with all financial and other covenants under each of our financing arrangements.\nCash Flows - Fiscal 2020 Compared with Fiscal 2019\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities-continuing operations was $19.1 million in fiscal 2020 compared to cash provided of $60.5 million in fiscal 2019. The decrease of $79.6 million was primarily attributable to timing of our cash receipts and disbursements on long-term programs.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities-continuing operations was $24.8 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $18.5 million in fiscal 2019. The increase from the prior year was primarily related to higher expenditures for property and equipment in the current year.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities-continuing operations was $444.5 million in fiscal 2020 compared to cash used of $47.3 million in fiscal 2019. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we elected to draw down our Revolving Credit Facility as a precautionary measure in light of economic and market uncertainty presented by COVID-19. These additional borrowings from our Revolving Credit Facility are largely being maintained in Cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nA summary of contractual cash obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements as of May 31, 2020 is as follows:\nNotes:\n1 Interest associated with variable rate debt was determined using the interest rate in effect on May 31, 2020.\n2 Purchase obligations arise in the ordinary course of business and represent a binding commitment to acquire inventory, including raw materials, parts, and components, as well as equipment to support the operations of our business.\n3 Our contribution policy for the domestic plans is to contribute annually, at a minimum, an amount which is deductible for federal income tax purposes and that is sufficient to meet actuarially computed pension benefits. For our Netherlands pension plan, our policy is to fund at least the minimum amount required by the local laws and regulations. We anticipate contributing approximately $3.1 million to our pension plans during fiscal 2021, which includes approximately $1.1 million of the Netherlands\u2019 fiscal 2020 contribution which was deferred to fiscal 2021.\nWe routinely issue letters of credit and performance bonds in the ordinary course of business. These instruments are typically issued in conjunction with insurance contracts or other business requirements. The total of these instruments outstanding at May 31, 2020 was $31.5 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant estimates made by management include those related to assumptions used in assessing goodwill impairment, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories and certain rotable assets, revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, and assumptions used in determining pension plan obligations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following is a summary of the accounting policies considered critical by management.\nGoodwill\nUnder accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets, goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment tests. We review and evaluate our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for potential impairment at a minimum annually, on May 31, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment is possible.\nThe accounting standards for goodwill allow for either a qualitative or quantitative approach for the annual impairment test. Under the qualitative approach, factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions and company-specific events or circumstances are assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. When the quantitative approach is utilized, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, we would be required to recognize an impairment loss for the excess carrying value of the reporting unit\u2019s assets.\nIn fiscal 2018, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test over our former Airlift reporting unit as a result of a decision to exit our COCO business. The COCO business was reclassified to discontinued operations and goodwill was allocated to the COCO business based on its relative fair value to the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on a combination of the expected net proceeds upon sale and a discounted cash flow analysis. As the fair value of the COCO business was below its carrying value, a goodwill impairment charge of $9.8 million was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\nAs of May 31, 2020, we had three reporting units, which included two in our Aviation Services segment (Aviation Supply Chain and Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) and one comprised of our Expeditionary Services segment. In fiscal 2019 and 2018, we utilized the qualitative assessment approach for all reporting units. Under this approach, we considered the overall industry and market conditions related to the aerospace and government/defense markets as well as conditions in the global capital markets. We also considered the long-term forecasts for each reporting unit, which incorporated specific opportunities and risks, working capital requirements, and capital expenditure needs. We concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value at the respective measurement dates, and thus no impairment charges were recorded in those fiscal years.\nIn fiscal 2020, we elected to skip the qualitative assessment due to the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 and utilized a quantitative assessment approach for all reporting units. We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using primarily an income approach based on discounted cash flows. The assumptions we used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units are based on historical performance, as well as forecasts used in our current business plan and require considerable management judgment in light of the impact of COVID-19. All three of our reporting units have been impacted by the reduced numbers of commercial aircraft flying and the overall decline in flight hours. We have incorporated a decline in demand from commercial airline customers for our next fiscal year followed by a multiple year recovery as passenger miles and flight hours progressively increase.\nWe used discount rates based on our consolidated weighted average cost of capital which is adjusted for each of our reporting units based on their specific risk, size, and industry characteristics. The fair value measurements used for our goodwill impairment testing use significant unobservable inputs, which reflect our own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in measuring fair value. The fair value of our reporting units is also impacted by our overall market capitalization and may be impacted by volatility in our stock price and assumed control premium, among other items.\nUpon completion of the annual quantitative goodwill impairment analysis as of May 31, 2020 for our reporting units, we concluded the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying values, and thus no impairment charges were recorded.\nWe also evaluate the sensitivity of the discounted cash flow valuations by assessing the impact of changes in certain assumptions on the estimated fair value of each reporting unit by increasing the discount rates and/or adjusting our business plan assumptions including slower recovery of sales from COVID-19 and reduced profitability. All of our reporting units would have had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values under all our sensitivity scenarios.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (estimated net realizable value). Cost is determined by the specific identification, average cost or first-in, first-out methods. Write-downs are made for excess and obsolete inventories and inventories that have been impaired as a result of industry conditions. We have utilized certain assumptions when determining the market value of inventories, such as inventory quantities and aging, historical sales of inventory, current and expected future aviation usage trends, replacement values, expected future demand, and historical scrap recovery rates. Reductions in demand for certain of our inventories or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the market value of our inventories, could result in the recognition of impairment charges in future periods.\nIn conjunction with the decision to exit certain product lines and facilities, we recognized inventory impairment charges of $3.9 million in fiscal 2020.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.\nOur unit of accounting for revenue recognition is a performance obligation included in our customer contracts. A performance obligation reflects the distinct good or service that we must transfer to a customer. At contract inception, we evaluate if the contract should be accounted for as a single performance obligation or if the contract contains multiple performance obligations. In some cases, our contract with the customer is considered one performance obligation as it includes factors such as whether the good or service being provided is significantly integrated with other promises in the contract, whether the service provided significantly modifies or customizes another good or service or whether the good or service is highly interdependent or interrelated. If the contract has more than one performance obligation, we determine the standalone price of each distinct good or service underlying each performance obligation and allocate the transaction price based on their relative standalone selling prices.\nThe transaction price of a contract, which can include both fixed and variable amounts, is allocated to each performance obligation identified. Some contracts contain variable consideration, which could include incremental fees or penalty provisions related to performance. Variable consideration that can be reasonably estimated based on current assumptions and historical information is included in the transaction price at the inception of the contract but limited to the amount that is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Variable consideration that cannot be reasonably estimated is recorded when known.\nOur performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time based on transfer of control of products and services to our customers. The majority of our sales from products are recognized at a point in time upon transfer of control to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. In connection with certain sales of products, we also provide logistics services, which include inventory management, replenishment, and other related services. The price of such services is generally included in the price of the products delivered to the customer, and revenues are recognized upon delivery of the product, at which point the customer has obtained control of the product. We do not account for these services separate from the related product sales as the services are inputs required to fulfill part orders received from customers.\nFor our performance obligations that are satisfied over time, we measure progress in a manner that depicts the performance of transferring control to the customer. As such, we utilize the input method of cost-to-cost to recognize revenue over time as this depicts when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the customer. Revenue is recognized based on the relationship of actual costs incurred to date to the estimated total cost at completion of the performance obligation. We are required to make certain judgments and estimates, including estimated revenues and costs, as well as inflation and the overall profitability of the arrangement. Key assumptions involved include future labor costs and efficiencies, overhead costs, and ultimate timing of product delivery. Differences may occur between the judgments and estimates made by management and actual program results.\nChanges in estimates and assumptions related to our arrangements accounted for using the cost-to-cost method are recorded using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. These changes are primarily adjustments to the estimated profitability for our long-term programs where we provide component inventory management and/or repair services.\nWhen contracts are modified, we consider whether the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications that are for goods or services that are not distinct from the existing contract, due to the significant integration with the original goods or services provided, are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract with the effect of the contract modification recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. When the modifications include additional performance obligations that are distinct, they are accounted for as a new contract and performance obligation, which are recognized prospectively.\nUnder most of our U.S. government contracts, if the contract is terminated for convenience, we are entitled to payment for items delivered and fair compensation for work performed, the costs of settling and paying other claims, and a reasonable profit on the costs incurred or committed.\nWe have elected to use certain practical expedients permitted under ASC 606. Shipping and handling fees and costs incurred associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in Cost of sales on our Consolidated Statements of Income, and are not considered a performance obligation to our customers. Our reported sales on our Consolidated Statements of Income are net of any sales or related non-income taxes. We also utilize the \u201cas invoiced\u201d practical expedient in certain cases where performance obligations are satisfied over time and the invoiced amount corresponds directly with the value we are providing to the customer.\nThe timing of revenue recognition, customer billings, and cash collections results in a contract asset or contract liability at the end of each reporting period. Contract assets consist of unbilled receivables or costs incurred where revenue recognized over time using the cost-to-cost model exceeds the amounts billed to customers. Contract liabilities include advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. Certain customers make advance payments prior to the satisfaction of our performance obligations on the contract. These amounts are recorded as contract liabilities until such performance obligations are satisfied, either over time as costs are incurred or at a point in time when deliveries are made. Contract assets and contract liabilities are determined on a contract-by-contract basis.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts. In determining the required allowance, we consider factors such as general and industry-specific economic conditions, customer credit history, and our customers\u2019 current and expected future financial performance. The majority of our customers are recurring customers with an established payment history. Certain customers are required to undergo an extensive credit check prior to delivery of products or services.\nWe perform regular evaluations of customer payment experience, current financial condition, and risk analysis. We may require collateral in the form of security interests in assets, letters of credit, and/or obligation guarantees from financial institutions for transactions executed on other than normal trade terms. We also maintain trade credit insurance for certain customers to provide coverage, up to a certain limit, in the event of insolvency of some customers.\nIn fiscal 2019, we recognized a provision for doubtful accounts of $12.4 million related to the bankruptcy of a European airline customer. The provision consisted of impairment of non-current contract assets of $7.6 million, allowance for doubtful accounts of $3.3 million, and other liabilities of $1.5 million.\nIn addition, we currently have past due accounts receivable owed by former commercial program customers primarily related to our exit from customer contracts in certain geographies, including Colombia, Peru, and Poland. Our past due accounts receivable owed by these customers was $10.9 million as of May 31, 2020 which was net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $9.3 million.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe are required to test for impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows. When applying accounting standards addressing impairment of long-lived assets, we have utilized certain assumptions to estimate future undiscounted cash flows, including current and future sales volumes or lease rates, expected changes to cost structures, lease terms, residual values, market conditions, and trends impacting future demand. Differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining undiscounted cash flows could result in future impairments of long-lived assets. We recognized pre-tax asset impairment charges related to our COCO business of $11.8 million, $74.1 million, and $64.0 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, related to assets included in our COCO business, which is classified as a discontinued operation.\nWe maintain a significant inventory of rotable parts and equipment to service customer aircraft and components. Portions of that inventory are used parts that are often exchanged with parts removed from aircraft or components, and are reworked to a useable condition. We may have to recognize an impairment of our rotable parts and equipment if we discontinue using or servicing certain aircraft models or if an older aircraft model is phased-out in the industry. In conjunction with the decision to exit certain product lines, we recognized rotable asset impairment charges of $1.9 million in fiscal 2020.\nPension Plans\nThe projected benefit obligation for our benefit plans exceeds our plan assets by $27.3 million as of May 31, 2020. Our projected benefit obligation exceeds our plan assets for both our U.S. plans and for our Netherlands plan with the U.S. benefit plans underfunded by $14.6 million and the Netherlands plan underfunded by $12.7 million.\nThe liabilities and net periodic cost of our pension plans are determined utilizing several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\nAAR uses discount rates to measure our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for our pension plans. We used a broad population of Aa-rated corporate bonds as of May 31, 2020 to determine the discount rate assumption. All bonds were denominated in U.S. Dollars, with a minimum outstanding of $50.0 million. This population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of over 500 Moody\u2019s Aa-rated, non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds by eliminating the top 10th percentile and the bottom 40th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds we would most likely select if we were to actually annuitize our pension plan liabilities. This portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the projected benefit payments for the domestic plans. The discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve.\nWe establish the long-term asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns, both company-specific and relating to the broad market, as well as analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations. The current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both our actual and target asset allocation. In calculating the net pension cost, the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value on plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years. The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-02, Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d), which amended the existing accounting standards for lease accounting. ASC 842 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for most lease arrangements, including those classified as operating leases. In addition, ASC 842 requires new qualitative and quantitative disclosures about our leasing activities.\nWe adopted ASC 842 on June 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition approach. Under that approach, prior periods have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. A discussion of our revised accounting policy for leases is included in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe have elected the package of practical expedients, which must be elected as a package and applied consistently to all leases. This package permits us to not reassess our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. In addition, we have elected the practical expedients to not separate lease and non-lease components for both lessee and lessor relationships and to not apply the recognition requirements to leases with terms of less than twelve months.\nUpon adoption of ASC 842 on June 1, 2019, we recognized operating lease ROU assets of $123.2 million and operating lease liabilities of $116.8 million on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts included operating lease ROU assets of $26.6 million and operating lease liabilities of $25.3 million related to our discontinued operations. In addition, we recognized the remaining unamortized deferred gains of $2.5 million, net of tax, associated with sale-leaseback transactions as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of June 1, 2019.\nThe adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations or Cash Flows.\nThe impact of the adoption of ASC 842 on our Consolidated Balance Sheet was as follows:\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASC 606, which provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASC 606 superseded the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance.\nWe adopted ASC 606 on June 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Under that approach, prior periods were not restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. We elected to use the practical expedient allowing for the application of ASC 606 only to contracts that were not completed as of June 1, 2018. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying ASC 606 as a decrease of $20.4 million to the opening balance of retained earnings as of June 1, 2018.\nThe adoption of ASC 606 impacted us in three primary areas. First, we have certain contracts in which revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method over the expected term of the contract. Under ASC 606, the contract term used for revenue recognition purposes was shortened to exclude any unexercised customer option years or incorporate customer rights to terminate the contract without significant penalty as we do not have any enforceable rights or obligations prior to the exercise of the underlying option. The impact of this change as of June 1, 2018 resulted in the elimination of certain deferred costs and the establishment of accrued liabilities reflecting our estimated obligations under the contracts. For this change, we recognized a decrease of $22.1 million to the opening balance of retained earnings as of June 1, 2018.\nSecond, we have contracts under which we perform repair services on customer-owned assets whereby the customer simultaneously receives the benefits of the repair. These contracts also transitioned to an over time revenue recognition model as of June 1, 2018 compared to our prior policy of recognizing revenue at the time of shipment. The impact of this change as of June 1, 2018 resulted in the elimination of certain inventory and accounts receivable amounts and the establishment of a contract asset reflecting the over time revenue recognition treatment. For this change, we recognized an increase of $1.3 million to the opening balance of retained earnings as of June 1, 2018.\nThird, we have certain contracts under which we manufacture products with no alternative use as the customer owns the underlying intellectual property and we have an enforceable right to payment from the customer. As a result, we now recognize revenue for these contracts over time as opposed to at the time of shipment, which was our policy prior to June 1, 2018. The impact of this change as of June 1, 2018 resulted in the elimination of certain inventory amounts and the establishment of a contract asset reflecting the over time revenue recognition treatment. For this change, we recognized an increase of $0.4 million to the opening balance of retained earnings as of June 1, 2018.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU requires a change in the measurement approach for credit losses on financial assets measured on an amortized cost basis from an incurred loss method to an expected loss method, thereby eliminating the requirement that a credit loss be considered probable to impact the valuation of a financial asset measured on an amortized cost basis. This ASU also requires the measurement of expected credit losses to be based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and a reasonable and supportable forecast of the collectability of the related financial asset. We plan to adopt this ASU on June 1, 2020 and the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur exposure to market risk includes fluctuating interest rates under our credit agreements, changes in foreign exchange rates, and credit losses on accounts receivable. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on accounts receivable exposure.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. A 10 percent increase in the average interest rate affecting our financial instruments, including the average outstanding balance of our debt obligations would not have had a significant impact on our pre-tax income during fiscal 2020.\nRevenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates during the year, and balance sheet accounts are translated at year-end exchange rates. Balance sheet translation adjustments are excluded from the results of operations and are recorded in stockholders\u2019 equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. A hypothetical 10 percent devaluation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would not have had a material impact on our financial position or continuing operations during fiscal 2020.",
    "item_8": "ITEM 8.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nAAR CORP.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AAR CORP. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended May 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended May 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated July 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases effective June 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases, and its method of accounting for revenue recognition as of June 1, 2018, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAssessment of the write-down of inventories\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the inventory balance as of May 31, 2020 was $623.1 million. The Company records inventory within the Aviation Services segment at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The write-down of slow moving inventory is recorded for excess or obsolete inventory based on certain inputs and assumptions used to determine the net realizable value. These assumptions include the number of days transpiring from the date the inventory was originally received, and the historical sales of inventory to determine recovery rates. Other inputs include current and expected future aviation usage trends, replacement values, expected future demand, and historical scrap recovery rates.\nWe identified the assessment of the write-down of inventories for a portion of the inventory within the Aviation Services segment as a critical audit matter. The primary inputs and assumptions used in determining the write-down of slow moving inventory include the historical recovery rates, which are based on the number of days transpiring from the date the inventory was originally received, the historical sales of inventory, and the identification of specific inventories used to service customers no longer under contract. The assessment of these inputs required a higher degree of subjective auditor judgment in evaluating the future customer demand for slow moving inventory.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s inventory process, including controls over the Company\u2019s evaluation of the impact on the estimate of net realizable value based on 1) the number of days transpiring from the date the inventory was originally received, 2) historical sales of inventory, and 3) specific inventory used to service customers no longer under contract. We also tested relevant information technology application controls over the determination of the number of days transpiring from the date the inventory was originally received. We evaluated the write-down to determine that it was recorded using the Company\u2019s policy based on the number of days transpiring from the date the inventory was originally received, and the recovery rates of existing inventory based on historical sales. We also assessed that the recovery rates applied to slow moving inventory were consistent with historical sales of these inventory items. We determined that the specific inventory items written down were valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value based on observable market prices.\nEvaluation of the key inputs and assumptions used in the estimation of costs at completion of the performance obligations\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue over time upon the satisfaction of component inventory management and repair services performance obligations based on the cost-to-cost input method, which is based on the relationship of costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs at completion of the performance obligation within the Aviation Services segment. The net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments recognized during fiscal year 2020 associated with the Company\u2019s component inventory management and repair services totaled $3.9 million, which resulted from changes in the estimated costs at completion of the performance obligations.\nWe identified the evaluation of the key inputs and assumptions used in the estimation of costs at completion of the inventory management and repair services performance obligations for certain contracts within the Aviation Services segment as a critical audit matter. The key inputs and assumptions used in determining the revenue to be recognized include current and future costs to support the program, and future labor costs. The testing of the inputs and assumptions required the application of subjective auditor judgment because of the estimation associated with the inputs and assumptions.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s revenue process, including controls over 1) the assessment of the estimated future costs, 2) actual costs incurred for each performance obligation that are used by the Company in their assessment of the measure of progress, and 3) the approval of costs recorded for each performance obligation to assess the allowability per the contract. We obtained the Company\u2019s forecast for the cost of a selection of component inventory management and repair services and assessed that the measure of progress was determined using actual costs to date plus the estimated future costs to support the satisfaction of performance obligations. We selected a sample of contracts to test fiscal year 2020 program costs. We assessed the Company\u2019s historical estimates to determine the consistency with the Company\u2019s historical projected costs.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1985.\nChicago, Illinois\nJuly 21, 2020\nAAR CORP.

(the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a diversified provider of services and products to the worldwide commercial aviation and government and defense markets. Services and products include: aviation supply chain and parts support programs; customer fleet management and operations; maintenance, repair and overhaul of airframes, landing gear, and certain other airframe components; design and manufacture of specialized pallets, shelters, and containers; aircraft modifications and aircraft and engine sales and leasing. We serve commercial, government and defense aircraft fleet operators, original equipment manufacturers, and independent service providers around the world, and various other domestic and foreign military customers.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-02, Leases (\"ASC 842\"), which amended the existing accounting standards for lease accounting. ASC 842 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for most lease arrangements, including those classified as operating leases. In addition, ASC 842 requires new qualitative and quantitative disclosures about our leasing activities.\nWe adopted ASC 842 on June 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition approach. Under that approach, prior periods have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. A discussion of our revised accounting policy for leases is included in Note 11.\nWe have elected the package of practical expedients, which must be elected as a package and applied consistently to all leases. This package permits us to not reassess our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. In addition, we have elected the practical expedients to not separate lease and non-lease components for both lessee and lessor relationships and to not apply the recognition requirements to leases with terms of less than twelve months.\nUpon adoption of ASC 842 on June 1, 2019, we recognized operating lease ROU assets of $123.2 million and operating lease liabilities of $116.8 million on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts included operating lease ROU assets of $26.6 million and operating lease liabilities of $25.3 million related to our discontinued operations. In addition, we recognized the remaining unamortized deferred gains of $2.5 million, net of tax, associated with sale-leaseback transactions as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of June 1, 2019.\nThe adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations or Cash Flows.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nThe impact of the adoption of ASC 842 on our Consolidated Balance Sheet was as follows:\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d), which provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASC 606 superseded the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance.\nWe adopted ASC 606 on June 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Under that approach, prior periods were not restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. We elected to use the practical expedient allowing for the application of ASC 606 only to contracts that were not completed as of June 1, 2018. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying ASC 606 as a decrease of $20.4 million to the opening balance of retained earnings as of June 1, 2018.\nRevenue Recognition for Fiscal 2020 and 2019\nRevenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.\nOur unit of accounting for revenue recognition is a performance obligation included in our customer contracts. A performance obligation reflects the distinct good or service that we must transfer to a customer. At contract inception, we evaluate if the contract should be accounted for as a single performance obligation or if the contract contains multiple performance obligations. In some cases, our contract with the customer is considered one performance obligation as it includes factors such as whether the good or service being provided is significantly integrated with other promises in the contract, whether the service provided significantly modifies or customizes another good or service or whether the good or service is highly interdependent or interrelated. If the contract has more than one performance obligation, we determine the standalone price of each distinct good or service underlying each performance obligation and allocate the transaction price based on their relative standalone selling prices.\nThe transaction price of a contract, which can include both fixed and variable amounts, is allocated to each performance obligation identified. Some contracts contain variable consideration, which could include incremental fees or penalty provisions related to performance. Variable consideration that can be reasonably estimated based on current assumptions and historical information is included in the transaction price at the inception of the contract but limited to the amount that is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Variable consideration that cannot be reasonably estimated is recorded when known.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nOur performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time based on transfer of control of products and services to our customers. The majority of our sales from products are recognized at a point in time upon transfer of control to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. In connection with certain sales of products, we also provide logistics services, which include inventory management, replenishment, and other related services. The price of such services is generally included in the price of the products delivered to the customer, and revenues are recognized upon delivery of the product, at which point the customer has obtained control of the product. We do not account for these services separate from the related product sales as the services are inputs required to fulfill part orders received from customers.\nFor our performance obligations that are satisfied over time, we measure progress in a manner that depicts the performance of transferring control to the customer. As such, we utilize the input method of cost-to-cost to recognize revenue over time as this depicts when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the customer. Revenue is recognized based on the relationship of actual costs incurred to date to the estimated total cost at completion of the performance obligation. We are required to make certain judgments and estimates, including estimated revenues and costs, as well as inflation and the overall profitability of the arrangement. Key assumptions involved can include customer volume, future labor costs and efficiencies, repair or overhaul costs, overhead costs, and ultimate timing of product delivery. Differences may occur between the judgments and estimates made by management and actual program results. For contracts that are deemed to be loss contracts, we establish forward loss reserves for total estimated costs that are in excess of total estimated consideration in the period in which they become known.\nWhen contracts are modified, we consider whether the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications that are for goods or services that are not distinct from the existing contract, due to the significant integration with the original goods or services provided, are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract with the effect of the contract modification recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. When the modifications include additional performance obligations that are distinct, they are accounted for as a new contract and performance obligation, which are recognized prospectively.\nUnder most of our U.S. government contracts, if the contract is terminated for convenience, we are entitled to payment for items delivered and fair compensation for work performed, the costs of settling and paying other claims, and a reasonable profit on the costs incurred or committed.\nWe have elected to use certain practical expedients permitted under ASC 606. Shipping and handling fees and costs incurred associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in Cost of sales on our Consolidated Statements of Income, and are not considered a performance obligation to our customers. Our reported sales on our Consolidated Statements of Income are net of any sales or related non-income taxes. We also utilize the \u201cas invoiced\u201d practical expedient in certain cases where performance obligations are satisfied over time and the invoiced amount corresponds directly with the value we are providing to the customer.\nRevenue Recognition for Fiscal 2018\nSales and related cost of sales for product sales are generally recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer. Our standard terms and conditions provide that title passes to the customer when the product is shipped to the customer. Sales of certain defense products are recognized upon customer acceptance, which includes transfer of title. Sales from services and the related cost of services are generally recognized when customer-owned material is shipped back to the customer. Furthermore, serviced units are typically shipped to the customer immediately upon completion of the related services. Sales and related cost of sales for certain large airframe maintenance contracts and performance-based logistics programs are recognized by the percentage of completion method, based on the relationship of costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nCertain supply chain management programs we provide to our customers contain multiple elements or deliverables, such as program and warehouse management, parts distribution, and maintenance and repair services. We recognize revenue for each element or deliverable that can be identified as a separate unit of accounting at the time of delivery based upon the relative fair value of the products and services.\nCumulative Catch-up Adjustments\nChanges in estimates and assumptions related to our arrangements accounted for using the cost-to-cost method are recorded using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. These changes are primarily adjustments to the estimated profitability for our long-term programs where we provide component inventory management and/or repair services.\nFavorable and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were as follows:\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nThe timing of revenue recognition, customer billings, and cash collections results in a contract asset or contract liability at the end of each reporting period. Contract assets consist of costs incurred where revenue recognized over time using the cost-to-cost model exceeds the amounts billed to customers. Contract liabilities include advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. Certain customers make advance payments prior to the satisfaction of our performance obligations on the contract. These amounts are recorded as contract liabilities until such performance obligations are satisfied, either over time as costs are incurred or at a point in time when deliveries are made. Contract assets and contract liabilities are determined on a contract-by-contract basis.\nNet contract assets and liabilities are as follows:\nContract assets - non-current is reported within Other non-current assets, and Contract liabilities - current is reported within Accrued Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in contract assets and contract liabilities primarily result from the timing difference between our performance of services and payments from customers.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nDuring fiscal 2020, we terminated certain commercial power-by-the-hour (\u201cPBH\u201d) customer contracts and restructured another PBH contract. The restructured contract was deemed a loss contract requiring the establishment of forward loss reserves for the total estimated costs that are in excess of the total estimated consideration over the remainder of the contracts. The impact from these actions resulted in a charge of $31.3 million during fiscal 2020, which included a reduction in revenue of $17.3 million, the establishment of forward loss reserves of $5.4 million, and other related charges of $8.6 million. As of May 31, 2020, our Consolidated Balance Sheet included remaining forward loss reserves of $5.4 million with $3.1 million classified as current in Accrued liabilities and $2.3 million classified as long-term in Other liabilities.\nChanges in our deferred revenue, after adoption of ASC 606 on June 1, 2018, were as follows:\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of May 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.0 billion of remaining performance obligations, also referred to as firm backlog, which excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under our indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. We expect that approximately 50% of this backlog will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, with the majority of the remaining balance recognized over the next three years. The amount of remaining performance obligations, which is expected to be recognized as revenue beyond 12 months, primarily relates to our long-term, power-by-the-hour programs where we provide component inventory management and/or repair services.\nFinancial Instruments and Concentrations of Market or Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of market or credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. While our trade receivables are diverse and represent a number of entities and geographic regions, the majority are with the U.S. government and its contractors and entities in the aviation industry. The composition of our accounts receivable is as follows:\nIn addition, we currently have past due accounts receivable owed by former commercial program customers primarily related to our exit from customer contracts in certain geographies, including Colombia, Peru, and Poland. Our past due accounts receivable owed by these customers was $10.9 million as of May 31, 2020 which was net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $9.3 million.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts and trade notes payable approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of long-term debt bearing a variable interest rate approximates fair value.\nFair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts. In determining the required allowance, we consider factors such as general and industry-specific economic conditions, customer credit history, and our customers\u2019 current and expected future financial performance. The majority of our customers are recurring customers with an established payment history. Certain customers are required to undergo an extensive credit check prior to delivery of products or services. Our allowance for doubtful accounts also includes reserves for estimated product returns.\nWe perform regular evaluations of customer payment experience, current financial condition, and risk analysis. We may require collateral in the form of security interests in assets, letters of credit, and/or obligation guarantees from financial institutions for transactions executed on other than normal trade terms. We also maintain trade credit insurance for certain customers to provide coverage, up to a certain limit, in the event of insolvency of some customers.\nIn fiscal 2019, we recognized a provision for doubtful accounts of $12.4 million related to the bankruptcy of a European airline customer. The provision consisted of impairment of non-current contract assets of $7.6 million, allowance for doubtful accounts of $3.3 million, and other liabilities of $1.5 million.\nThe change in our allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment tests. We review and evaluate our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for potential impairment at a minimum annually, on May 31, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment is possible.\nAs of May 31, 2020, we had three reporting units, which included two in our Aviation Services segment (Aviation Supply Chain and Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) and one comprised of our Expeditionary Services segment. In fiscal 2019 and 2018, we utilized the qualitative assessment approach for all reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value at the respective measurement dates, and thus no impairment charges were recorded.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nIn fiscal 2020, we elected to skip the qualitative assessment due to the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and utilized a quantitative assessment approach for all reporting units. We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using primarily an income approach based on discounted cash flows. The assumptions we used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units are based on historical performance, as well as forecasts used in our current business plan and require considerable management judgment in light of the impact of COVID-19. We used discount rates based on our consolidated weighted average cost of capital which is adjusted for each of our reporting units based on their specific risk, size, and industry characteristics. The fair value measurements used for our goodwill impairment testing use significant unobservable inputs, which reflect our own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in measuring fair value. The fair value of our reporting units is also impacted by our overall market capitalization and may be impacted by volatility in our stock price and assumed control premium, among other items.\nUpon completion of the annual quantitative goodwill impairment analysis as of May 31, 2020 for our reporting units, we concluded the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying values, and thus no impairment charges were recorded.\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for fiscal 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are comprised of the following:\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nIn conjunction with the adoption of ASC 842 on June 1, 2019, our intangible assets for lease agreements were re-classified to the ROU asset. During fiscal 2020, we recognized an impairment charge of $5.4 million related to the exit of certain product lines across both our Aviation Services and Expeditionary Services segments.\nCustomer relationships are being amortized over 5-20 years. Amortization expense recorded during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $2.3 million, $3.9 million, and $4.7 million, respectively. The estimated aggregate amount of amortization expense for intangible assets in each of the next five fiscal years is $1.7 million in 2021, $1.0 million in 2022, $0.5 million in 2023, $0.3 million in 2024 and $0.3 million in 2025.\nForeign Currency\nOur foreign subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency. All balance sheet accounts of foreign subsidiaries transacting business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated at year-end exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Translation adjustments are excluded from the results of operations and are recorded in stockholders\u2019 equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until such subsidiaries are liquidated.\nCash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments which have original maturities of three months or less when purchased. Restricted cash represents cash on hand required to be set aside by a contractual agreement related to receivable securitization arrangements. Generally, the restrictions related to the receivable securitization arrangements lapse at the time we remit the customer payments collected by us as servicer of previously sold customer receivables to the purchaser.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (estimated net realizable value). Cost is determined by the specific identification, average cost, or first-in, first-out methods. From time-to-time, we purchase aircraft and engines for disassembly to individual parts and components. Costs are assigned to these individual parts and components utilizing list prices from original equipment manufacturers and recent sales history.\nThe following is a summary of inventories:\nRotable Assets and Equipment under Leases\nThe cost of the asset under lease is the original purchase price plus overhaul costs. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated service life of the equipment. The balance sheet classification of equipment under lease is generally based on lease term, with fixed-term leases less than twelve months generally classified as short-term and all others generally classified as long-term.\nEquipment on short-term lease includes aircraft engines and parts on or available for lease to satisfy customers\u2019 immediate short-term requirements. The leases are renewable with fixed terms, which generally vary from one to twelve months.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Other Non-Current Assets\nWe record property, plant and equipment at cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over useful lives of 10-40 years for buildings and improvements and 3-10 years for equipment, furniture and fixtures, and capitalized software. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the applicable lease.\nRepair and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or disposal, cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and related gains and losses are included in results of operations.\nRotable assets supporting long-term programs consist of rotable component parts used to support long-term supply chain programs. The assets are being depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, we are required to test for impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows. We utilize certain assumptions to estimate future undiscounted cash flows, including demand for our services, future market conditions and trends, business development pipeline of opportunities, current and future lease rates, lease terms, and residual values. In conjunction with the decision to exit certain product lines, we recognized rotable asset impairment charges of $1.9 million in fiscal 2020.\nFuture rent due to us under non-cancelable leases during each of the next five fiscal years is $12.2 million in 2021, $11.6 million in 2022, $11.4 million in 2023, $11.3 million in 2024, and $11.3 million in 2025.\nInvestments\nInvestments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not control the entity, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Significant influence generally exists if we have a 20% to 50% ownership interest in the investee. Our share of the net earnings or loss of our investees is included in operating income on our Consolidated Statements of Income since the activities of the investees are closely aligned with our operations. Equity investments in entities over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence and whose securities do not have a readily determinable fair value are carried at cost.\nWe evaluate our investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. If a decline in the value of an investment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period.\nOur investments are classified in Other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Distributions from joint ventures are classified as operating or investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows based upon an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances of each distribution.\nRestructuring and Other Exit Costs\nWe recognize charges for restructuring and other exit costs such as product line exits and facility closures at their fair value when incurred. In cases where employees are required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive the termination benefits and will be retained beyond the minimum retention period, we record the expense ratably over the future service period.\nDuring fiscal 2020, we incurred severance and furlough-related costs of $7.1 million which were included as a component of Cost of sales and services and Selling, general and administrative on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our remaining liability for these costs as of May 31, 2020 was $5.5 million which is included in Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S., state, and several foreign jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of business, there can be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns in accordance with applicable accounting guidance for accounting for income taxes, using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.\nWe record a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Both positive and negative evidence are considered in forming our judgment as to whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, and more weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. Valuation allowances are reassessed whenever there are changes in circumstances that may cause a change in judgment.\nThe accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Where necessary, we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made.\nSupplemental Information on Cash Flows\nSupplemental information on cash flows is as follows:\nDuring fiscal 2020, treasury stock decreased $5.0 million reflecting restricted stock activity of $0.8 million and the re-issuance of shares upon exercise of stock options, net of shares withheld to satisfy statutory tax obligations, of $8.3 million partially offset by the repurchase of common shares of $4.1 million.\nDuring fiscal 2019, treasury stock increased $7.0 million reflecting the repurchase of common shares of $10.3 million, restricted stock activity of $0.8 million partially offset by the re-issuance of shares upon exercise of stock options, net of shares withheld to satisfy statutory tax obligations, of $4.1 million.\nDuring fiscal 2018, treasury stock increased $0.9 million reflecting the repurchase of common shares of $13.1 million, restricted stock activity of $1.0 million and the re-issuance of shares upon exercise of stock options, net of shares withheld to satisfy statutory tax obligations, of $11.2 million.\nUse of Estimates\nWe have made estimates and utilized certain assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent liabilities to prepare these Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU requires a change in the measurement approach for credit losses on financial assets measured on an amortized cost basis from an incurred loss method to an expected loss method, thereby eliminating the requirement that a credit loss be considered probable to impact the valuation of a financial asset measured on an amortized cost basis. This ASU also requires the measurement of expected credit losses to be based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and a reasonable and supportable forecast of the collectability of the related financial asset. We plan to adopt this ASU on June 1, 2020 and the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n2. Discontinued Operations\nOur Contractor-Owned, Contractor-Operated (\u201cCOCO\u201d) business previously included in our Expeditionary Services segment completed certain contracts in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. As the aircraft supporting these contracts were not placed on new contracts, combined with the continued decline in operational tempo within the U.S. Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d) and an excess supply of aircraft assets in the market, we determined there was an impairment triggering event and tested the recoverability of our COCO assets. As a result, we recognized impairment and other charges of $54.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The fair value of the aircraft and related assets was based on available market data for similar assets.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we decided to pursue the sale of our COCO business. Due to this strategic shift, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of our COCO business have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Goodwill was allocated to this business based on its relative fair value to the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on a combination of the expected net proceeds upon sale and a discounted cash flow analysis. As the fair value of the COCO business was below its carrying value, a goodwill impairment charge of $9.8 million was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\nDuring fiscal 2019, we signed an agreement to sell our U.S. Department of Defense (\"DoD\") contracts and certain assets of our COCO business. In conjunction with this agreement and other expected asset sales, we recognized an impairment charge in discontinued operations of $74.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 reflecting the expected net proceeds to be received upon the completion of the sale transactions.\nIn fiscal 2020, we signed an agreement to sell the remaining operating contract of the COCO business and recognized an impairment charge of $11.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 related to the disposal of the remaining COCO assets. The sale of the DoD contracts and related assets was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and the sale of the remaining operating contract was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 shortly after government approval. Our continuing involvement in the COCO business is limited to the lease of certain aircraft which is an obligation of the acquirer of the non-DoD contract.\nNo amounts for general corporate overhead or interest expense were allocated to discontinued operations during the periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, amounts and disclosures throughout these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements relate to our continuing operations.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n2. Discontinued Operations (Continued)\nOperating results for discontinued operations were comprised of the following:\nThe carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities for our discontinued operations are as follows:\n3. Sale of Receivables\nOn February 23, 2018, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Citibank N.A. (\u201cPurchaser\u201d) for the sale, from time to time, of certain accounts receivable due from certain customers (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d). Under the Purchase Agreement, the maximum amount of receivables sold is limited to $150 million and Purchaser may, but is not required to, purchase the eligible receivables we offer to sell. The term of the Purchase Agreement runs through February 22, 2021, however, the Purchase Agreement may also be terminated earlier under certain circumstances. The term of the Purchase Agreement shall be automatically extended for annual terms unless either party provides advance notice that they do not intend to extend the term.\nWe have no retained interests in the sold receivables, other than limited recourse obligations in certain circumstances, and only perform collection and administrative functions for the Purchaser. We account for these receivable transfers as sales under ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, and de-recognize the sold receivables from our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nReceivables sold under the Purchase Agreement during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $746.4 million, $744.2 million, and $239.6, respectively. Amounts remitted to the Purchaser on their behalf during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $758.3 million, $729.7 million, and $167.9, respectively. As of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, we had collected cash of $20.0 million and $19.8 million, respectively, which was not yet remitted to the Purchaser as of those dates and was classified as Restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe recognize discounts on the sale of our receivables and other fees related to the Purchase Agreement in Other expense, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we incurred discounts on the sale of our receivables and other fees of $1.8 million, $2.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n4. Financing Arrangements\nDebt Outstanding\nA summary of the carrying amount of our debt is as follows:\nAt May 31, 2020, our variable rate debt had a fair value that approximates its carrying value and is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nOn October 18, 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, as lender (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement provided a Canadian $31 million term loan with the proceeds used to fund the acquisition of two maintenance, repair, and overhaul (\u201cMRO\u201d) facilities in Canada from Premier Aviation. The term loan is due in full at the expiration of the Credit Agreement on November 1, 2021 unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. Interest is payable monthly on the term loan at the offered fluctuating Canadian Dollar Offer Rate plus 125 to 225 basis points based on certain financial measurements if a Bankers\u2019 Acceptances loan, or at the offered fluctuating Prime Rate plus 25 to 125 basis points based on certain financial measurements, if a Prime Rate loan.\nOn September 25, 2019, we entered into an amendment to our Revolving Credit Facility that extended the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility to September 25, 2024, increased the revolving credit commitment to $600 million, and modified certain other provisions. Under certain circumstances, we have the ability to request, but our lenders are not required to grant, an increase to the revolving credit commitment by an aggregate amount of up to $300 million, not to exceed $900 million in total.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the offered Eurodollar Rate plus 87.5 to 175 basis points based on certain financial measurements if a Eurodollar Rate loan, or at the offered fluctuating Base Rate plus 0 to 75 basis points based on certain financial measurements if a Base Rate loan.\nOur financing arrangements also require us to comply with leverage and interest coverage ratios, maintain a minimum net working capital level, and comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants, including those relating to financial reporting and notification, payment of indebtedness, cash dividends, taxes and other obligations, compliance with applicable laws, and limitations on additional liens, indebtedness, acquisitions, investments and disposition of assets. The Revolving Credit Facility also requires our significant domestic subsidiaries, and any subsidiaries that guarantee our other indebtedness, to provide a guarantee of payment under the Revolving Credit Facility. At May 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial and other covenants in our financing agreements.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n4. Financing Arrangements (Continued)\nBorrowing activity under the Revolving Credit Facility during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:\nWe also have $9.3 million available under foreign lines of credit.\n5. Equity\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have granted stock-based awards under the AAR CORP. 2013 Stock Plan (the \u201c2013 Stock Plan\u201d) and the AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan (\u201cStock Benefit Plan\u201d) each of which has been approved by our stockholders. No further awards will be made under the Stock Benefit Plan. Under the 2013 Stock Plan, we are authorized to issue stock options to employees and non-employee directors that allow the grant recipients to purchase shares of common stock at a price not less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Generally, stock options awarded expire ten years from the date of grant and are exercisable in three annual increments commencing one year after the date of grant. In addition to stock options, the 2013 Stock Plan also provides for the grant of time-based restricted stock awards and performance-based restricted stock awards. The number of performance-based awards earned, subject to vesting, is based on achievement of certain Company-wide or segment financial goals or stock price targets. The 2013 Stock Plan also provides for the grant of stock appreciation units and restricted stock units; however, to date, no such awards have been granted.\nRestricted stock grants (whether time-based or performance-based) are designed, among other things, to align employee interests with the interests of stockholders and to encourage the recipient to build a career with us. Restricted stock typically vests over periods of one to five years from the date of grant. Restricted stock grants may be performance-based with vesting to occur over periods of three to five years. All restricted stock that has been granted and, if performance-based, earned according to performance criteria carries full dividend and voting rights, regardless of whether it has vested.\nSubstantially all stock options and restricted stock are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting if the employee\u2019s employment terminates for any reason other than death, disability or retirement. Since inception, a total of 11,149,000 shares have been granted under the Stock Benefit Plan. We have granted a total of 3,656,000 shares under the 2013 Stock Plan. All future stock awards will be made under the 2013 Stock Plan. There were 646,088 shares available for grant under the 2013 Stock Plan as of May 31, 2020.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n5. Equity (Continued)\nStock Options\nDuring fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, we granted stock options with respect to 414,460 shares, 300,240 shares and 463,140 shares, respectively. The weighted average fair value per share of stock options granted during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $10.30, $13.60 and $9.29, respectively. The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions:\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock, and the expected option term represents the period of time that the stock options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise trends. The dividend yield represents our anticipated cash dividends at the grant date over the expected option term.\nA summary of stock option activity for the three years ended May 31, 2020 consisted of the following (shares in thousands):\nThe total fair value of stock options that vested during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $3.7 million, $5.6 million, and $4.9 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $6.2 million, $12.2 million, and $14.2 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding was $0.5 million and $6.7 million as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The tax benefit realized from stock options exercised during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $2.1 million, $2.7 million, and $2.9 million, respectively. Expense recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses for stock options during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $3.9 million, $4.1 million, and $5.1 million, respectively. As of May 31, 2020, we had $4.2 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options that will be amortized over an average period of 1.3 years.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n5. Equity (Continued)\nRestricted Stock\nWe provide executives and other key employees an opportunity to be awarded performance-based and time- based restricted stock. The performance-based awards are contingent upon the achievement of certain objectives, which generally include cumulative income, average return on capital, and relative total shareholder return over a three-year performance period. During fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, we granted 52,475, 43,680, and 108,440 of performance-based restricted shares, respectively. Time-based restricted shares of 56,535, 46,470, and 24,425 were granted to executives and key employees during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We also award time-based restricted stock to our non-employee directors as part of their annual compensation. Time-based restricted shares of 44,123, 29,128, and 55,000 were granted to members of the Board of Directors during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nThe fair value of restricted shares is the market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Expense recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses for all restricted share programs during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $3.4 million, $9.4 million, and $10.2 million, respectively.\nRestricted share activity during fiscal 2020 was as follows (shares in thousands):\nAs of May 31, 2020 we had $2.5 million of unearned compensation related to restricted shares that will be amortized to expense over a weighted average period of 1.6 years.\nStockholder Rights Plan\nPursuant to a limited duration stockholder rights plan adopted in 2020, each outstanding share of our common stock carries with it a right to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (a \u201cPreferred Share\u201d) for $100.00 (the \u201cExercise Price\u201d). The rights become exercisable when certain specified events occur, including the acquisition of 10% (or 20% in the case of passive investors who are eligible to, and do, report their holdings on Schedule 13G with the SEC) or more of the common stock by a person or group (an \"Acquiring Person\") or the commencement of a tender or exchange offer for 10% or more of the common stock without the approval of the Board of Directors.\nIn the event that an Acquiring Person acquires 10% or more of the common stock, or if we are the surviving corporation in a merger involving an Acquiring Person or if the Acquiring Person engages in certain types of self-dealing transactions, each right entitles the holder (other than the Acquiring Person) to purchase a Preferred Share for the Exercise Price. Similarly, if we are acquired in a merger or other business combination or 50% or more of our assets or earning power is sold, each right entitles the holder (other than the Acquiring Person) to purchase at the then-current exercise price that number of shares of common stock of the surviving corporation having a market value of two times the exercise price. The rights do not entitle the holder thereof to vote or to receive dividends. The rights will expire on February 28, 2021, and may be redeemed by us for $.0001 per right under certain circumstances.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n6. Income Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Reform Act\") was enacted which significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax system. The Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the corporate federal income tax rate to 21% from 35%, changed bonus depreciation regulations and limited deductions for executive compensation. The income tax rate reduction in the Tax Reform Act was effective January 1, 2018 which resulted in a blended federal statutory tax rate of 29.2% in fiscal 2018.\nIn fiscal 2018, we re-measured our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the tax rate at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which was either at a federal rate of 29.2% for reversals expected in fiscal 2018 or 21% for reversals in fiscal 2019 and subsequent years. During fiscal 2018, we recognized an income tax benefit of $14.1 million for the re-measurement impact from applying the provisions of the Tax Reform Act.\nThe provision for income tax on income from continuing operations includes the following components:\nThe provision for income taxes on pre-tax income differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21.0% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, and 29.2% for fiscal 2018 to income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes due to the following:\nIncome before provision for income taxes includes the following components:\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n6. Income Taxes (Continued)\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets result primarily from the differences in the timing of the recognition of transactions for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Our deferred tax liabilities and assets consist of the following components:\nAs of May 31, 2020, we have determined that the realization of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not and that a valuation allowance is not required. Our net operating losses have carry forward periods that range from 5 to 20 years. Our history of operating earnings, our expectations for continued future earnings, the nature of certain of our deferred tax assets and the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to depreciation, support the recoverability of the majority of the deferred tax assets. Our net deferred tax assets are included in Other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIncome tax receivable was $7.9 million and $1.1 million at May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and was included in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOur federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2017 and subsequent are open for examination. Various states and foreign jurisdictions also remain open subject to their applicable statute of limitations.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n7. Earnings Per Share\nThe computation of basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. The computation of diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus, when their effect is dilutive, incremental shares consisting of shares subject to stock options and shares issuable upon vesting of restricted stock awards.\nIn accordance with ASC 260-10-45, Share-Based Payment Arrangements and Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method, our unvested restricted stock awards are deemed participating securities since these shares are entitled to participate in dividends declared on common shares. During periods of net income, the calculation of earnings per share for common stock excludes income attributable to unvested restricted stock awards from the numerator and excludes the dilutive impact of those shares from the denominator. During periods of net loss, no effect is given to the participating securities because they do not share in the losses of the Company.\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of the computations of basic and diluted earnings per share information for each of the years in the three-year period ended May 31, 2020 (shares in millions).\nAt May 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively, outstanding options to purchase 669,400 and 273,400 shares of common stock were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, because the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market price of the common shares for the year then ended. At May 31, 2018, the average market price of our common shares was in excess of the exercise prices of all of our outstanding options.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n8. Employee Benefit Plans\nDefined Benefit Plans\nPrior to January 1, 2000, the pension plan for domestic salaried and non-union hourly employees had a benefit formula based primarily on years of service and compensation. Effective January 1, 2000, we converted our defined benefit plan for substantially all domestic salaried and certain hourly employees to a cash balance pension plan. Under the cash balance pension plan, the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in an account that grows with annual pay-based credits and interest on the account balance. The interest crediting rate under our cash balance plan is determined quarterly and is equal to 100% of the average 30-year treasury rate for the second month preceding the applicable quarter published by the Internal Revenue Service. The average interest crediting rate under our cash balance plan for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020 was 4.46%. Effective June 1, 2005, the existing cash balance plan was frozen and the annual pay-based credits were discontinued. Also effective June 1, 2005, the defined contribution plan was modified to include increased employer contributions and an enhanced profit sharing formula. Defined pension benefits for certain union hourly employees are based primarily on a fixed amount per year of service and the plan was frozen in fiscal 2018.\nWe also have a defined benefit pension plan covering certain employees in the Netherlands. Benefit formulas are based generally on years of service and compensation.\nWe also have a benefit plan which provides benefits to certain retired outside directors. In fiscal 2001, we froze the plan for any new members of the Board of Directors and no current directors participate in this plan.\nThe change to our projected benefit obligation and the fair value of our plan assets for our pension plans was as follows:\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n8. Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)\nAmounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consisted of the following:\nFor all of our pension plans, both the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation are in excess of the individual plans\u2019 assets. The accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans was $151.9 million and $142.4 million at May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost\nPension expense charged to the Consolidated Statements of Income includes the following components:\nThe estimated amount of net actuarial loss to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into expense during fiscal 2021 is $2.2 million.\nAssumptions\nThe assumptions used in accounting for our plans are estimates of factors including, among other things, the amount and timing of future benefit payments. The following table presents the key weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of our projected benefit obligations:\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n8. Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)\nA summary of the weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic pension expense is as follows:\nThe discount rate was determined by projecting the expected future benefit payments as defined for the projected benefit obligation, discounting those expected payments using a theoretical zero-coupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of high-quality bonds as of the measurement date, and solving for the single equivalent discount rate that resulted in the same projected benefit obligation.\nPlan Assets\nThe following table sets forth the actual asset allocation and target allocations for our U.S. pension plans:\nThe assets of U.S pension plans are invested in compliance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The investment goals are to provide a total return that, over the long term, optimizes the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable risk, and to maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers. We believe that there are no significant concentrations of risk within our plan assets as of May 31, 2020. The use of derivatives for the purpose of speculation are not permitted. The assets of the U.S. pension plans are invested primarily in equity and fixed income mutual funds, individual common stocks, and fund-of-funds hedge funds. The assets of the non-domestic plan are invested in funds-of-funds where each fund holds a portfolio of equity and fixed income mutual funds.\nTo develop our expected long-term rate of return assumption on domestic plans, we use long-term historical return information for our targeted asset mix and current market conditions. The expected return for each asset class is weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption. While consideration is given to recent performance, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective rate of return.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n8. Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)\nThe following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, pension plan assets at their fair value as of May 31, 2020:\nThe following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, pension plan assets at their fair value as of May 31, 2019:\n(1) Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that we have the ability to access as of the reporting date.\n(2) Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data.\n(3) Unobservable inputs, such as internally developed pricing models or third party valuations for the asset due to little or no market activity for the asset.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n8. Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of Level 3 pension assets measured at fair value for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2020 and 2019:\nValuation Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value\nCash equivalents are investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The fair values are based on observable market prices and categorized as Level 1.\nWith respect to individually held equity securities, including investments in U.S. and international securities, the trustees obtain prices from pricing services, whose prices are obtained from direct feeds from market exchanges, which we are able to independently corroborate. Equity securities held individually are primarily traded on exchanges that contain only actively traded securities, due to the volume trading requirements imposed by these exchanges. Equity securities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and categorized as Level 1.\nEquity and fixed income mutual funds are maintained by investment companies that hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives, which are consistent with our overall investment strategy. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted. For equity and fixed income mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. As certain of our funds-of-funds investments are also derived from quoted prices in active markets, we have categorized certain funds-of-funds investments as Level 2.\nHedge fund investments include those seeking to maximize absolute returns using a broad range of strategies to enhance returns and provide additional diversification. The fair value of hedge funds is determined using net asset value or its equivalent subject to certain restrictions, such as a lock-up period. As we may be limited in our ability to redeem the investments at the measurement date or within a reasonable period of time, the hedge fund investments are categorized as Level 3. Our other Level 3 investments require the utilization of unobservable inputs resulting in Level 3 treatment in the fair value hierarchy.\nFuture Benefit Payments and Funding\nThe following table summarizes our estimated future pension payments by fiscal year:\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n8. Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)\nOur contribution policy for the domestic plans is to contribute annually, at a minimum, an amount which is deductible for federal income tax purposes and that is sufficient to meet actuarially computed pension benefits. For our Netherlands pension plan, our policy is to fund at least the minimum amount required by the local laws and regulations. We anticipate contributing approximately $3.1 million to our pension plans during fiscal 2021, which includes approximately $1.1 million of the Netherlands' fiscal 2020 contribution which was deferred to fiscal 2021.\nPostretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions\nWe provide health and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retirees. The postretirement plan is unfunded and in fiscal 1995, we completed termination of postretirement health and life insurance benefits attributable to future services of collective bargaining and other domestic employees. The unfunded projected benefit obligation for this plan was $0.4 million and $0.4 million as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We have omitted substantially all of the required disclosures related to this plan because the plan is not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nDefined Contribution Plan\nOur defined contribution plans are intended to qualify as a 401(k) plans under the Internal Revenue Code. Employees may contribute up to 75% of their pretax compensation, subject to applicable regulatory limits and we may make discretionary matching contributions up to 5% of employee compensation. We modified the contribution structure in fiscal 2020 to eliminate the profit sharing contribution for future years. Our contributions vest on a pro-rata basis during the first three years of employment. We also maintain a non-qualified retirement plan that makes up 401(k) benefits that would otherwise be lost as a result of Internal Revenue Code limits and provides additional employer contributions for certain executives and key employees to supplement the benefits provided by the defined contribution plans.\nIn response to the impact from COVID-19, we temporarily suspended our matching contributions to the defined contribution plans effective June 1, 2020. Expense charged to the Consolidated Statements of Income for our matching contributions, including profit sharing contributions, was $11.6 million in fiscal 2020, $11.4 million in fiscal 2019 and $9.2 million in fiscal 2018 for these plans.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n9. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nChanges in our accumulated other comprehensive loss (\u201cAOCL\u201d) by component for each of the years in the three-year period ended May 31, 2020 were as follows (all amounts are net of tax):\n10. Other Non-current Assets\nAt May 31, 2020 and 2019, other non-current assets consisted of the following:\nInvestments in Joint Ventures\nDuring fiscal 2018, we sold interests in two aircraft joint ventures, which were accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We received cash proceeds of $7.3 million and recognized a gain on the sale of $0.4 million.\nUnder the terms of servicing agreements with certain of our aircraft joint ventures, we provide administrative services and technical advisory services, including aircraft evaluations, oversight and logistical support of the maintenance process and records management. We also provide evaluation and inspection services prior to the purchase of an aircraft and remarketing services with respect to the divestiture of aircraft by the joint ventures. During fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, we were paid $1.6 million, $0.4 million, and $0.4 million, respectively, for such services.\nOur investments in joint ventures include $12.6 million for our 40% ownership interest in a joint venture in India to develop and operate an airframe maintenance facility. Facility construction is expected to be completed in fiscal 2021.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n10. Other Non-current Assets (Continued)\nThe investment balance as of May 31, 2020 includes $8.2 million related to the guarantee liability recognized in conjunction with our guarantee of 40% of the Indian joint venture\u2019s debt. The Indian joint venture is accounted for using the equity method. In addition, each of the partners in the Indian joint venture have a loan to the joint venture proportionate to its equity ownership. Our loan to the Indian joint venture under this arrangement was $3.0 million as of May 31, 2020.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we decided to exit our joint venture which operates a landing gear wheel and brake repair and overhaul facility in Malaysia. In conjunction with the decision to exit the joint venture, we recognized an impairment charge of $1.9 million reflecting the anticipated net proceeds from our investment. The impairment charge is reported in Earnings (Loss) from joint ventures on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nLicense Fees\nIn June 2011, we entered into a ten-year agreement with Unison Industries (\u201cUnison\u201d) to be the exclusive worldwide aftermarket distributor for Unison\u2019s electrical components, sensors, switches and other systems for aircraft and industrial uses. In June 2020, we entered into an extension and expansion of our agreement with Unison including a new termination date of December 31, 2031, an initial $25.0 million license fee paid in June 2020 to Unison, and annual license fees at a fixed percentage of our net sales of Unison products. The June 2020 payment of $25.0 million was capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the new agreement.\n11. Leases\nWe lease facilities, offices, vehicles, and equipment. We determine at inception whether an arrangement that provides us control over the use of an asset is a lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Our lease agreements do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate nor is it available to us from our lessors. We estimate our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at lease commencement in order to discount lease payments to present value.\nOur lease costs are allocated over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis unless another systematic or rational basis is more representative of the pattern in which the underlying asset is expected to be used. ROU assets are evaluated for impairment in a manner consistent with the treatment of other long-lived assets.\nCertain leases include options to renew or extend the terms of the lease, which are included in the determination of the ROU assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Our leases may also include variable lease payments such as escalation clauses based on consumer price index rates, maintenance costs and utilities. Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate are included in the determination of ROU assets and lease liabilities using the index or rate at the lease commencement date, whereas variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are recorded as lease expense in the period incurred. Our lease agreements do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nThe summary of our operating lease cost is as follows:\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n11. Leases (Continued)\nRental expense for facilities and equipment during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was $25.9 million and $23.5 million, respectively.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we entered into deferral agreements with our various landlords in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Under these agreements, certain rent payments will be deferred or modified without penalty for various periods, generally for a minimum of three months. We have elected to account for lease concessions and deferrals resulting directly from COVID-19 as though the enforceable rights and obligations to the deferrals existed in the respective contracts at lease inception and will not account for the concessions as lease modifications. As of May 31, 2020, our total rent payments deferred under these arrangements was $0.6 million.\nWith the exception of a land lease for one of our airframe maintenance facilities that expires in 2108, our operating leases expire at various dates through 2034. Maturities of our operating lease payments as of May 31, 2020 are as follows:\nThe current portion of operating lease liabilities are presented within Accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nAs of May 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases were approximately 7.9 years and 3.5%, respectively.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases for the year ended May 31, 2020 was as follows:\n12. Commitments and Contingencies\nWe enter into purchase obligations, which arise in the ordinary course of business and represent a binding commitment to acquire inventory, including raw materials, parts and components, as well as equipment to support the operations of our business. The aggregate amount of purchase obligations due in each of the next five fiscal years is $344.8 million in 2021, $15.8 million in 2022, $5.4 million in 2023, $0.1 in 2024 and $0.1 million in 2025.\nWe routinely issue letters of credit and performance bonds in the ordinary course of our business. These instruments are typically issued in conjunction with insurance contracts or other business requirements. The total of these instruments outstanding at May 31, 2020 was approximately $31.5 million which includes $12.4 million related to a guarantee of 40% of the outstanding debt of our Indian joint venture. We have recognized a current liability of $8.2 million based on the fair value of our guarantee obligation.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n12. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)\nWe are involved in various claims and legal actions, including environmental matters, arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nGovernment Actions to Mitigate COVID-19\u2019s Impact\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) was enacted in the U.S. in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferral of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes, net operating loss carrybacks, and other areas. The payroll tax deferral requires that the deferred payroll taxes be paid over two years, with half of the amount required to be paid by December 31, 2021 and the other half by December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we deferred $2.5 million of payroll taxes which are included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nCertain subsidiaries of the Company expect to receive $57.2 million from the U.S. Treasury Department through the Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act. These funds will be used exclusively for the continuation of payment of employee wages, salaries and benefits for employees of those subsidiaries. Of the $57.2 million total amount expected to be received, approximately $48.5 million will be a direct grant and approximately $8.7 million will be in the form of a low interest 10-year senior unsecured promissory note. We expect that certain corporate restrictions will apply to us and those subsidiaries for approximately the next two years including restrictions on dividends, stock repurchases, employee compensation, and certain workforce actions.\nOther countries have enacted similar legislation to provide relief and stimulus measures to assist companies in mitigating the financial impact from COVID-19 and supporting their employees. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, our foreign subsidiaries recognized employment subsidies of $2.8 million from foreign governments which have been deducted from the related expenses on our Consolidated Statement of Income.\n13. Acquisition\nOn September 19, 2017, we acquired the outstanding shares of two MRO facilities in Canada owned by Premier Aviation for approximately $24.8 million. The purchase price includes $22.9 million paid at closing with the remaining deferred consideration paid in September 2018. This business is included in our Aviation Services segment. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows:\n14. Business Segment Information\nSegment Reporting\nConsistent with how our chief operating decision making officer (Chief Executive Officer) evaluates performance and the way we are organized internally, we report our activities in two segments: Aviation Services comprised of supply chain and MRO activities and Expeditionary Services comprised of manufacturing activities.\n14. Business Segment Information (Continued)\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe Aviation Services segment consists of aftermarket support and services offerings that provide spare parts and maintenance support for aircraft operated by our commercial and government/defense customers. Sales in the Aviation Services segment are derived from the sale and lease of a wide variety of new, overhauled and repaired engine and airframe parts and components to the commercial aviation and government and defense markets. We provide customized inventory supply chain management, performance-based logistics programs, customer fleet management and operations, and aircraft component repair management services. The segment also includes repair, maintenance and overhaul of aircraft, landing gear and components. Cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product, direct labor, and overhead.\nThe Expeditionary Services segment consists of primarily manufacturing operations with sales derived from the design and manufacture of pallets, shelters, and containers used to support the U.S. military\u2019s requirements for a mobile and agile force including engineering, design, and system integration services for specialized command and control systems. This segment also designs and manufactures advanced composite materials for commercial, business and military aircraft. Cost of sales consists principally of the cost of material to manufacture products, direct labor and overhead.\nThe accounting policies for the segments are the same as those described in Note 1. Our chief operating decision making officer (Chief Executive Officer) evaluates performance based on the reportable segments and utilizes gross profit as a primary profitability measure. Gross profit is calculated by subtracting cost of sales from sales. The assets and certain expenses related to corporate activities are not allocated to the segments. Our reportable segments are aligned principally around differences in products and services.\nSelected financial information for each segment is as follows:\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n14. Business Segment Information (Continued)\n1 Includes amortization of stock-based compensation.\nThe following table reconciles segment gross profit to income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes.\nThe U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of State, other U.S. government agencies and their contractors are our only customers representing 10% or more of total sales in any of the last three fiscal years. Sales by segment for these customers are as follows:\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n14. Business Segment Information (Continued)\nSales across the major customer markets for each of our operating segments for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nSales by type of product/service was as follows:\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n14. Business Segment Information (Continued)\nGeographic Data\nSales by geographic region for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nSales to unaffiliated customers in foreign countries (including sales through foreign sales offices of domestic subsidiaries) were approximately $591.8 million (28.6% of total sales), $661.8 million (32.3% of total sales) and $694.0 million (39.7% of total sales) in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n15. Legal Proceedings\nWe are not a party to any material pending legal proceeding (including any governmental or environmental proceeding) other than routine litigation incidental to our business except for the following:\nDepartment of Justice Investigation\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDoJ\u201d), acting through the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Illinois, is conducting an investigation of AAR Airlift Group, Inc. (\"Airlift\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAR CORP., under the federal civil False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d). The investigation relates to Airlift\u2019s performance of several contracts awarded by the U.S. Transportation Command concerning the operations and maintenance of rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft in Afghanistan and Africa, as well as several U.S. Navy contracts. In June 2018, the DoJ informed Airlift that part of the investigation was precipitated by a lawsuit filed under the qui tam provisions of the FCA by a former employee of Airlift. That lawsuit remains under seal.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n15. Legal Proceedings (Continued)\nAirlift is cooperating with the DoJ investigation. In order to explore whether a negotiated resolution of the matter is possible, and in an effort to minimize continuing legal defense costs, Airlift has entered into settlement discussions with the DoJ. Airlift believes it has meritorious defenses and counter-arguments to the concerns raised by the DoJ; however, there is no assurance that any settlement will be achieved. If no settlement is reached, the DoJ and the qui tam plaintiff could pursue civil litigation under the FCA, which provides for the recovery of, among other amounts, treble damages and penalties.\nWhile we believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss from this matter, we cannot yet reasonably estimate the maximum amount of potential loss, nor can we provide any assurance that the ultimate resolution of the remaining exposure for this matter will not be material.\nSelf-Reporting of Potential Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Violations\nThe Company retained outside counsel to investigate possible violations of the Company\u2019s Code of Conduct, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other applicable laws, relating to the Company\u2019s activities in Nepal and South Africa. Based on these investigations, we self-reported these matters to the DoJ, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the UK Serious Fraud Office. The Company is fully cooperating with the reviews by these agencies, although we are unable at this time to predict what action, if any, they may take.\n16. Sale of Composites Business\nOn June 23, 2020, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the \u201cComposites Sale Agreement\u201d) for the sale of our aerostructures and aerospace products operations located in Clearwater, Florida and Sacramento, California (the \u201cComposites\u201d). The sale of Composites is consistent with our multi-year strategy to focus our portfolio on our core services offerings and the transaction will allow the Company to further prioritize its efforts in its principal businesses. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of calendar year 2020 and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nIn connection with the entry into the Composites Sale Agreement, we anticipate recognizing an impairment charge of approximately $20 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The impairment charge reduces the net assets of Composites to the estimated net proceeds we expect to receive, which is comprised of both cash received at closing of the transaction and the fair value of contingent consideration related to achievement of sales targets for Composites over the next three years.\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n17. Selected Quarterly Data (Unaudited)\nThe unaudited selected quarterly data for fiscal years ended May 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\n(1) We recognized charges of $24.7 million and $6.6 million during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020, respectively, related to the termination and restructuring of commercial PBH contracts.\nIn fiscal 2020, we recognized impairment charges of $11.0 million related to the exit of certain product lines across our operations. We also recognized costs of $4.9 million related to the closure of two facilities and $5.0 million for workforce actions including severance and furlough costs in fiscal 2020.\n(2) We recognized an impairment charge in discontinued operations of $74.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 related to our COCO business reflecting the expected net proceeds to be received upon the completion of the sale of our DoD contracts and related assets. We recognized an impairment charge of $11.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 related to the sale of the remaining COCO operating contract.\n(3) The earnings-per-share computation for the year is a separate, annual calculation. Accordingly, the sum of the quarterly earnings-per-share amounts does not necessarily equal the earnings per share for the year.",

    "item_9A": "ITEM 9A.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cAct\u201d), as of May 31, 2020. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Therefore, effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\nBased upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of May 31, 2020, ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed under the Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner.\nManagement Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of AAR CORP. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Act. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems which are determined to be effective provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and oversight of the Board of Directors, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020 based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nAs disclosed in Part II, Item 9A Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we identified material weaknesses in internal control related to (a) our controls over the existence of inventories included in our inventory cycle counting, (b) information technology general controls (\u201cITGCs\u201d), and (c) controls over vendor payment information.\nDuring fiscal 2020, management implemented our previously disclosed remediation plan. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed our testing of the operating effectiveness of the implemented controls and found them to be effective. As a result we have concluded the material weaknesses have been remediated as of May 31, 2020. Based on our assessment, management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020.\nKPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. That report appears below.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nEffective June 1, 2019, we adopted ASC 842, which amended the existing accounting standards for lease accounting. We have implemented certain changes to our internal controls over financial reporting to support the reporting and disclosure requirements of the new lease standard. Other than changes related to our material weakness remediation efforts and the new accounting processes, systems, and controls for lease accounting, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during fiscal 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nAAR CORP.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited AAR CORP.\u2019s and subsidiaries\u2019 (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated July 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nJuly 21, 2020",
