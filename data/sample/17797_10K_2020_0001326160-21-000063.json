    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nDUKE ENERGY\nGeneral\nDuke Energy was incorporated on May 3, 2005, and is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, subject to regulation by the FERC and other regulatory agencies listed below. Duke Energy operates in the U.S. primarily through its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Certain Duke Energy subsidiaries are also Subsidiary Registrants, including Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. When discussing Duke Energy\u2019s consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of its separate Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants electronically file reports with the SEC, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to such reports.\nThe SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at sec.gov. Additionally, information about the Duke Energy Registrants, including reports filed with the SEC, is available through Duke Energy\u2019s website at duke-energy.com. Such reports are accessible at no charge and are made available as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with or furnished to the SEC.\nBusiness Segments\nDuke Energy's segment structure includes three reportable business segments: Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables. The remainder of Duke Energy\u2019s operations is presented as Other. Duke Energy's chief operating decision-maker routinely reviews financial information about each of these business segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of the business. For additional information on each of these business segments, including financial and geographic information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cBusiness Segments.\u201d The following sections describe the business and operations of each of Duke Energy\u2019s business segments, as well as Other.\nELECTRIC UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure conducts operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Ohio. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure provides retail electric service through the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 7.9 million customers within the Southeast and Midwest regions of the U.S. The service territory is approximately 91,000 square miles across six states with a total estimated population of 25 million people. The operations include electricity sold wholesale to municipalities, electric cooperative utilities and other load-serving entities. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure is also a joint owner in certain electric transmission projects. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure has a 50% ownership interest in DATC, a partnership with American Transmission Company, formed to design, build and operate transmission infrastructure. DATC owns 72% of the transmission service rights to Path 15, an 84-mile transmission line in central California. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure also has a 50% ownership interest in Pioneer, which builds, owns and operates electric transmission facilities in North America. The following map shows the service territory for Electric Utilities and Infrastructure as of December 31, 2020.\nThe electric operations and investments in projects are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC, the NRC, the NCUC, the PSCSC, the FPSC, the IURC, the PUCO and the KPSC.\nThe following table represents the distribution of GWh billed sales by customer class for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe number of residential and general service customers within the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure service territory is expected to increase over time. Sales growth is expected within the service territory but continues to be influenced by adoption of energy efficiencies and self-generation. Residential sales increased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to customer growth and the stay-at-home orders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, sales for general service and industrial customers decreased in 2020 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. These trends in residential, general service and industrial sales may continue in the short term but are not expected to be permanent. It is still expected that the continued adoption of more efficient housing and appliances will have a negative impact on average usage per residential customer over time.\nSeasonality and the Impact of Weather\nRevenues and costs are influenced by seasonal weather patterns. Peak sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months, which results in higher revenue and cash flows during these periods. By contrast, lower sales of electricity occur during the spring and fall, allowing for scheduled plant maintenance. Residential and general service customers are more impacted by weather than industrial customers. Estimated weather impacts are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather conditions. Normal weather conditions are defined as the long-term average of actual historical weather conditions.\nThe estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the temperature variances from a normal condition and customers\u2019 historic usage patterns. The methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions such as humidity in the summer or wind chill in the winter. The precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long-term weather trends to shorter-term periods.\nHeating degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature falls below a base temperature. Cooling degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature rises above the base temperature. Each degree of temperature below the base temperature counts as one heating degree day and each degree of temperature above the base temperature counts as one cooling degree day.\nCompetition\nRetail\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure\u2019s businesses operate as the sole supplier of electricity within their service territories, with the exception of Ohio, which has a competitive electricity supply market for generation service. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure owns and operates facilities necessary to generate, transmit, distribute and sell electricity. Services are priced by state commission-approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair prices.\nIn Ohio, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure conducts competitive auctions for electricity supply. The cost of energy purchased through these auctions is recovered from retail customers. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure earns retail margin in Ohio on the transmission and distribution of electricity, but not on the cost of the underlying energy.\nCompetition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources including on-site generation from industrial customers and distributed generation, such as private solar, at residential, general service and/or industrial customer sites.\nWholesale\nDuke Energy competes with other utilities and merchant generators for bulk power sales, sales to municipalities and cooperatives and wholesale transactions under primarily cost-based contracts approved by FERC. The principal factors in competing for these sales are availability of capacity and power, reliability of service and price. Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and fuel costs.\nIncreased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission access could affect Electric Utilities and Infrastructure\u2019s load forecasts, plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues. Wholesale energy sales will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market and the ability of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to attract new customers and to retain existing customers.\nEnergy Capacity and Resources\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure owns approximately 50,807 MW of generation capacity. For additional information on owned generation facilities, see Item 2, \u201cProperties.\u201d\nEnergy and capacity are also supplied through contracts with other generators and purchased on the open market. Factors that could cause Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to purchase power for its customers may include, but are not limited to, generating plant outages, extreme weather conditions, generation reliability, demand growth and price. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure has interconnections and arrangements with its neighboring utilities to facilitate planning, emergency assistance, sale and purchase of capacity and energy and reliability of power supply.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure\u2019s generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest possible cost to meet its obligation to serve retail customers. All options, including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real-time basis to select and dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements.\nSources of Electricity\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure relies principally on natural gas, nuclear fuel and coal for its generation of electricity. The following table lists sources of electricity and fuel costs for the three years ended December 31, 2020.\n(a) Statistics related to all fuels reflect Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's ownership interest in jointly owned generation facilities.\n(b) Generating figures are net of output required to replenish pumped storage facilities during off-peak periods.\nNatural Gas and Fuel Oil\nNatural gas and fuel oil supply, transportation and storage for Electric Utilities and Infrastructure\u2019s generation fleet is purchased under standard industry agreements from various suppliers, including Piedmont. Natural gas supply agreements typically provide for a percentage of forecasted burns being procured over time, with varied expiration dates. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure believes it has access to an adequate supply of natural gas and fuel oil for the reasonably foreseeable future.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure has certain dual-fuel generating facilities that can operate utilizing both natural gas and fuel oil. The cost of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure\u2019s natural gas and fuel oil is fixed price or determined by published market prices as reported in certain industry publications, plus any transportation and freight costs. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana use derivative instruments to manage a portion of their exposure to price fluctuations for natural gas. For Duke Energy Florida, there is currently an agreed to moratorium with the FPSC on future hedging of natural gas prices.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure has firm interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation agreements and storage agreements in place to support generation needed for load requirements. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure may purchase additional shorter-term natural gas transportation and utilize natural gas interruptible transportation agreements to support generation needed for load requirements. The Electric Utilities and Infrastructure natural gas plants are served by various supply zones and multiple pipelines.\nNuclear\nThe industrial processes for producing nuclear generating fuel generally involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates and services to convert, enrich and fabricate fuel assemblies.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure has contracted for uranium materials and services to fuel its nuclear reactors. Uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services are primarily met through a diversified portfolio of long-term supply contracts. The contracts are diversified by supplier, country of origin and pricing. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure staggers its contracting so that its portfolio of long-term contracts covers the majority of its fuel requirements in the near term and decreasing portions of its fuel requirements over time thereafter. Near-term requirements not met by long-term supply contracts have been and are expected to be fulfilled with spot market purchases. Due to the technical complexities of changing suppliers of fuel fabrication services, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure generally source these services to a single domestic supplier on a plant-by-plant basis using multiyear contracts.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure has entered into fuel contracts that cover 100% of its uranium concentrates and conversion services through at least 2021, 100% of its enrichment services through at least 2022, and 100% of its fabrication services requirements for these plants through at least 2027. For future requirements not already covered under long-term contracts, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure believes it will be able to renew contracts as they expire or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services.\nCoal\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure meets its coal demand through a portfolio of long-term purchase contracts and short-term spot market purchase agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased under long-term contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure uses spot market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by long-term contracts. Expiration dates for its long-term contracts, which may have various price adjustment provisions and market reopeners, range from 2021 to 2023 for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress and 2021 to 2025 for Duke Energy Indiana. Expiration dates for Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Ohio are in 2021. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers as existing contracts expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure has an adequate supply of coal under contract to meet its risk management guidelines regarding projected future consumption. As a result of volatility in natural gas prices and the associated impacts on coal-fired dispatch within the generation fleet, coal inventories will continue to fluctuate. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure continues to actively manage its portfolio and has worked with suppliers to obtain increased flexibility in its coal contracts.\nCoal purchased for the Carolinas is primarily produced from mines in Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Florida is primarily produced from mines in the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Kentucky is produced from mines along the Ohio River in Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Coal purchased for Indiana is primarily produced in Indiana and Illinois. There are adequate domestic coal reserves to serve Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's coal generation needs through end of life. The current average sulfur content of coal purchased by Electric Utilities and Infrastructure is between 1.5% and 2% for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, and between 2.5% and 3% for Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's environmental controls, in combination with the use of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission allowances, enable Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to satisfy current SO2 emission limitations for its existing facilities.\nPurchased Power\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure purchases a portion of its capacity and system requirements through purchase obligations, leases and purchase capacity contracts. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure believes it can obtain adequate purchased power capacity to meet future system load needs. However, during periods of high demand, the price and availability of purchased power may be significantly affected.\nThe following table summarizes purchased power for the previous three years:\n(a) Represents approximately 13% of total system requirements for 2020, 14% for 2019 and 7% for 2018.\n(b) For 2020, 2019 and 2018, these agreements include approximately 412 MW of firm capacity under contract by Duke Energy Florida with QFs.\nInventory\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure must maintain an adequate stock of fuel and materials and supplies in order to ensure continuous operation of generating facilities and reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2020, the inventory balance for Electric Utilities and Infrastructure was approximately $3 billion. For additional information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nAsh Basin Management\nDuring 2015, EPA issued regulations related to the management of CCR from power plants. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and new and existing surface impoundments and establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments (ash basins or impoundments) will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, such as the Coal Ash Management Act in North Carolina.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure has and will periodically submit to applicable authorities required site-specific coal ash impoundment remediation or closure plans. Closure plans and all associated permits will receive necessary approvals before any work can begin. Closure activities have begun in all of Duke Energy's jurisdictions. Excavation began in 2015 at the four sites specified as high priority by the NC Coal Ash Management Act and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of CCR materials to off-site locations for use as structural fill, to appropriate engineered off-site or on-site lined landfills or for reuse in an approved beneficial application. Duke Energy has completed excavation of coal ash at three of the four high-priority NC sites. At other sites where CCR management is required, planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs, and closure activities have commenced.\nThe EPA CCR rule and the NC Coal Ash Management Act leave the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of coal ash surface impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. Duke Energy's electric utilities have included compliance costs associated with federal and state requirements in their respective rate proceedings. In January 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress reached a settlement agreement on recovery of coal ash costs, which is subject to review and approval of the NCUC. During 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress\u2019 wholesale contracts were amended to include the recovery of expenditures related to AROs for the closure of coal ash basins. The amended contracts have retail disallowance parity or provisions limiting challenges to CCR cost recovery actions at FERC. FERC approved the amended wholesale rate schedules in 2017. For additional information on the ash basins and recovery, see Item 7, \"Other Matters\" and Notes 3, 4 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Commitments and Contingencies\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" respectively.\nNuclear Matters\nDuke Energy owns, wholly or partially, 11 operating nuclear reactors located at six operating stations. The Crystal River Unit 3 permanently ceased operation in February 2013. Nuclear insurance includes: nuclear liability coverage; property damage coverage; nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage; and accidental outage coverage for losses in the event of a major accidental outage. Joint owners reimburse Duke Energy for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance in accordance with joint owner agreements. The Price-Anderson Act requires plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the maximum total financial protection liability, which is approximately $13.8 billion. For additional information on nuclear insurance, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nDuke Energy has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate each plant safely. The NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC require Duke Energy to update their cost estimates for decommissioning their nuclear plants every five years.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of NDTF investments and the most recent site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies. Decommissioning costs are stated in 2018 or 2019 dollars, depending on the year of the cost study, and include costs to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination.\n(a) Amounts for Progress Energy equal the sum of Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida.\n(b) Decommissioning cost for Duke Energy Carolinas reflects its ownership interest in jointly owned reactors. Other joint owners are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their interest in the reactors.\n(c) Duke Energy Carolinas' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost study completed in 2018 was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in 2019. A new funding study was also completed and filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in 2019.\n(d) Duke Energy Progress' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost study completed in 2019 was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in March 2020. Duke Energy Progress also completed a funding study, which was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in July 2020.\n(e) During 2019, Duke Energy Florida reached an agreement to transfer decommissioning work for Crystal River Unit 3 to a third party and decommissioning costs are based on the agreement with this third party rather than a cost study. Regulatory approval was received from the NRC and the FPSC in April 2020 and August 2020, respectively. See Note 3 for more information.\nThe NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC have allowed Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to recover estimated decommissioning costs through retail and wholesale rates over the expected remaining service periods of their nuclear stations. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure believes the decommissioning costs being recovered through rates, when coupled with the existing fund balances and expected fund earnings, will be sufficient to provide for the cost of future decommissioning. For additional information, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cAsset Retirement Obligations.\u201d\nThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (as amended) provides the framework for development by the federal government of interim storage and permanent disposal facilities for high-level radioactive waste materials. The government has not yet developed a storage facility or disposal capacity, so Electric Utilities and Infrastructure will continue to store spent fuel on its reactor sites.\nUnder federal law, the DOE is responsible for the selection and construction of a facility for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The DOE terminated the project to license and develop a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada in 2010, and is currently taking no action to fulfill its responsibilities to dispose of spent fuel.\nUntil the DOE begins to accept the spent nuclear fuel, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida will continue to safely manage their spent nuclear fuel. Under current regulatory guidelines, Harris has sufficient storage capacity in its spent fuel pools through the expiration of its renewed operating license. With certain modifications and approvals by the NRC to expand the on-site dry cask storage facilities, spent nuclear fuel dry storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage space of spent fuel through the expiration of the operating licenses, including any license renewals, for Brunswick, Catawba, McGuire, Oconee and Robinson. Crystal River Unit 3 ceased operation in 2013 and was placed in a SAFSTOR condition in January 2018. As of January 2018, all spent fuel at Crystal River Unit 3 has been transferred from the spent fuel pool to dry storage at an on-site independent spent fuel storage installation. During 2020, the NRC and the FPSC approved an agreement to transfer ownership of spent fuel for Crystal River Unit 3 to a third party. See Note 3 for more information.\nThe nuclear power industry faces uncertainties with respect to the cost and long-term availability of disposal sites for spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, compliance with changing regulatory requirements, capital outlays for modifications and new plant construction.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC for the design, construction and operation of its nuclear generating facilities. The following table includes the current year of expiration of nuclear operating licenses for nuclear stations in operation. During 2019, Duke Energy announced its intention to seek 20-year operating license renewals for each of the reactors it operates in Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress.\nThe NRC has acknowledged permanent cessation of operation and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel at Crystal River Unit 3. Therefore, the license no longer authorizes operation of the reactor. For additional information on nuclear decommissioning activity, see Notes 3 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" respectively.\nRegulation\nState\nThe state electric utility commissions approve rates for Duke Energy's retail electric service within their respective states. The state electric utility commissions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure\u2019s generating facilities. CPCNs issued by the state electric utility commissions, as applicable, authorize Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to construct and operate its electric facilities and to sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state electric utility commission is required for the entities within Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to issue securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus earn a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity.\nIn addition to rates approved in base rate cases, each of the state electric utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost-recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over or under-recovered costs, are prudent.\nFuel, fuel-related costs and certain purchased power costs are eligible for recovery by Electric Utilities and Infrastructure. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure uses coal, hydroelectric, natural gas, oil, renewable generation and nuclear fuel to generate electricity, thereby maintaining a diverse fuel mix that helps mitigate the impact of cost increases in any one fuel. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in fuel costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for fuel costs and recovery from customers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure.\nThe table below reflects significant electric rate case applications approved and effective in the past three years or applications currently pending approval.\n(a) Step 1 rates are approximately 75% of the total and became effective July 30, 2020. Step 2 rates are approximately 25% of the total rate case increase and will be implemented in mid-2021. Amounts exclude the Utility Receipt Tax amounts.\n(b) Partial Settlements were reached on July 31, 2020, which are subject to approval by the NCUC. Components of the partial settlements included a return of equity of 9.6% and a capital structure of 52% equity. These temporary rates went into effect August 24, 2020, for Duke Energy Carolinas and September 1, 2020, for Duke Energy Progress. A settlement was also reached, subject to approval by the NCUC, on coal ash cost recovery in January of 2021.\nAdditionally, in January 2021, Duke Energy Florida filed a settlement agreement with the FPSC that, if approved, will allow annual increases to its base rates at an agreed upon return on equity (\u201cROE\u201d) band and includes a base rate stay-out provision through 2024, among other provisions. For more information on rate matters and other regulatory proceedings, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cRegulatory Matters.\u201d\nFederal\nThe FERC approves Electric Utilities and Infrastructure\u2019s cost-based rates for electric sales to certain power and transmission wholesale customers. Regulations of FERC and the state electric utility commissions govern access to regulated electric and other data by nonregulated entities and services provided between regulated and nonregulated energy affiliates. These regulations affect the activities of nonregulated affiliates with Electric Utilities and Infrastructure.\nRTOs\nPJM and MISO are the ISOs and FERC-approved RTOs for the regions in which Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana operate. PJM and MISO operate energy, capacity and other markets, and control the day-to-day operations of bulk power systems through central dispatch.\nDuke Energy Ohio is a member of PJM and Duke Energy Indiana is a member of MISO. Transmission owners in these RTOs have turned over control of their transmission facilities and their transmission systems are currently under the dispatch control of the RTOs. Transmission service is provided on a regionwide, open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the RTO members at rates based on the costs of transmission service.\nEnvironmental\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure is subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA and state and local environmental agencies. For a discussion of environmental regulation, see \u201cEnvironmental Matters\u201d in this section. See the \u201cOther Matters\u201d section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for a discussion about potential Global Climate Change legislation and other EPA regulations under development and the potential impacts such legislation and regulation could have on Duke Energy\u2019s operations.\nGAS UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure conducts natural gas operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of Piedmont, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky. The natural gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the NCUC, PSCSC, PUCO, KPSC, TPUC, PHMSA and the FERC. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure serves residential, commercial, industrial and power generation natural gas customers, including customers served by municipalities who are wholesale customers. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure has over 1.6 million customers, including 1.1 million customers located in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, and an additional 541,000 customers located within southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky. In the Carolinas, Ohio and Kentucky, the service areas are comprised of numerous cities, towns and communities. In Tennessee, the service area is the metropolitan area of Nashville. The following map shows the service territory and investments in operating pipelines for Gas Utilities and Infrastructure as of December 31, 2020.\nThe number of residential, commercial and industrial customers within the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure service territory is expected to increase over time. Average usage per residential customer is expected to remain flat or decline for the foreseeable future; however, decoupled rates in North Carolina and various rate design mechanisms in other jurisdictions partially mitigate the impact of the declining usage per customer on overall profitability.\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure also owns, operates and has investments in various pipeline transmission and natural gas storage facilities.\nNatural Gas for Retail Distribution\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure is responsible for the distribution of natural gas to retail customers in its North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky service territories. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure\u2019s natural gas procurement strategy is to contract primarily with major and independent producers and marketers for natural gas supply. It also purchases a diverse portfolio of transportation and storage service from interstate pipelines. This strategy allows Gas Utilities and Infrastructure to assure reliable natural gas supply and transportation for its firm customers during peak winter conditions. When firm pipeline services or contracted natural gas supplies are temporarily not needed due to market demand fluctuations, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure may release these services and supplies in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release provisions or make wholesale secondary market sales. In 2020, firm supply purchase commitment agreements provided 100% of the natural gas supply for both Piedmont and Duke Energy Ohio.\nImpact of Weather\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure revenues are generally protected from the impact of weather fluctuations due to the regulatory mechanisms that are available in most service territories. In North Carolina, margin decoupling provides protection from both weather and other usage variations like conservation for residential and commercial customer classes. Margin decoupling provides a set revenue per customer independent of actual usage. In South Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky, weather normalization adjusts revenues either up or down depending on how much warmer or colder than normal a given month has been. Weather normalization adjustments occur from November through March in South Carolina, from October through April in Tennessee and from November through April in Kentucky. Duke Energy Ohio collects most of its non-fuel revenue through a fixed monthly charge that is not impacted by usage fluctuations that result from weather changes or conservation.\nCompetition\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure\u2019s businesses operate as the sole provider of natural gas service within their retail service territories. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure owns and operates facilities necessary to transport and distribute natural gas. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure earns retail margin on the transmission and distribution of natural gas and not on the cost of the underlying commodity. Services are priced by state commission-approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable natural gas service at fair prices.\nIn residential, commercial and industrial customer markets, natural gas distribution operations compete with other companies that supply energy, primarily electric companies, propane and fuel oil dealers, renewable energy providers and coal companies in relation to sources of energy for electric power plants, as well as nuclear energy. A significant competitive factor is price. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure's primary product competition is with electricity for heating, water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of natural gas or decreases in the price of other energy sources could negatively impact competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer. In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse economic or market conditions, including higher natural gas costs, could cause these customers to suspend business operations or to use alternative sources of energy in favor of energy sources with lower per-unit costs.\nHigher natural gas costs or decreases in the price of other energy sources may allow competition from alternative energy sources for applications that have traditionally used natural gas, encouraging some customers to move away from natural gas-fired equipment to equipment fueled by other energy sources. Competition between natural gas and other forms of energy is also based on efficiency, performance, reliability, safety and other non-price factors. Technological improvements in other energy sources and events that impair the public perception of the non-price attributes of natural gas could erode our competitive advantage. These factors in turn could decrease the demand for natural gas, impair our ability to attract new customers and cause existing customers to switch to other forms of energy or to bypass our systems in favor of alternative competitive sources. This could result in slow or no customer growth and could cause customers to reduce or cease using our product, thereby reducing our ability to make capital expenditures and otherwise grow our business, adversely affecting our earnings.\nPipeline and Storage Investments\nDuke Energy, through its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment, has a 7.5% equity ownership interest in Sabal Trail. Sabal Trail is a joint venture that owns the Sabal Trail Natural Gas Pipeline (Sabal Trail pipeline) to transport natural gas to Florida, regulated by FERC. The Sabal Trail Phase I mainline was placed into service in July 2017 and traverses Alabama, Georgia and Florida. The remaining lateral line to the Duke Energy Florida's Citrus County CC was placed into service in March 2018. Phase II of Sabal Trail went into service in May 2020, adding approximately 200,000 Dth of capacity to the Sabal Trail pipeline.\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 47% equity ownership interest in ACP, which planned to build the ACP pipeline, an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline. The ACP pipeline was intended to transport diverse natural gas supplies into southeastern markets and would be regulated by FERC. Dominion Energy owns 53% of ACP and was contracted to construct and operate the ACP pipeline upon completion. On July 5, 2020, Dominion announced a sale of substantially all of its gas transmission and storage segment assets, which were critical to the ACP pipeline. Further, permitting delays and legal challenges had materially affected the timing and cost of the pipeline. As a result, Duke Energy determined that they would no longer invest in the construction of the ACP pipeline. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Duke Energy recorded $2.1 billion of costs related to ACP.\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 24% equity ownership interest in Constitution, an interstate pipeline development company formed to develop, construct, own and operate a 124-mile natural gas pipeline and related facilities, regulated by FERC. Constitution was slated to transport natural gas supplies from the Marcellus supply region in northern Pennsylvania to major northeastern markets. As of February 5, 2020, the Constitution partners formally resolved to initiate the dissolution of Constitution, and to terminate the Constitution Pipeline project.\nDuke Energy, through its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment, has a 21.49% equity ownership interest in Cardinal, an intrastate pipeline located in North Carolina regulated by the NCUC, a 45% equity ownership in Pine Needle, an interstate liquefied natural gas storage facility located in North Carolina and a 50% equity ownership interest in Hardy Storage, an underground interstate natural gas storage facility located in Hardy and Hampshire counties in West Virginia. Pine Needle and Hardy Storage are regulated by FERC.\nKO Transmission Company (KO Transmission), a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio, is an interstate pipeline company engaged in the business of transporting natural gas and is subject to the rules and regulations of FERC. KO Transmission's 90-mile pipeline supplies natural gas to Duke Energy Ohio and interconnects with the Columbia Gulf Transmission pipeline and Tennessee Gas Pipeline. An approximately 70-mile portion of KO Transmission's pipeline facilities is co-owned by Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation.\nSee Notes 3, 12 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\" and \"Variable Interest Entities,\" respectively, for further information on Duke Energy's pipeline investments.\nInventory\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure must maintain adequate natural gas inventory in order to provide reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2020, the inventory balance for Gas Utilities and Infrastructure was $82 million. For more information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"\nRegulation\nState\nThe state gas utility commissions approve rates for Duke Energy's retail natural gas service within their respective states. The state gas utility commissions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of Gas Utilities and Infrastructure\u2019s natural gas distribution facilities. CPCNs issued by the state gas utility commissions or other government agencies, as applicable, authorize Gas Utilities and Infrastructure to construct and operate its natural gas distribution facilities and to sell natural gas to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state gas utility commission is required for Gas Utilities and Infrastructure to issue securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity.\nIn addition to amounts collected from customers through approved base rates, each of the state gas utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost-recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over- or under-recovered costs, are prudent.\nNatural gas costs are eligible for recovery by Gas Utilities and Infrastructure. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in natural gas costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for natural gas and recovery from customers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of Gas Utilities and Infrastructure.\nThe following table summarizes certain components underlying recently approved and effective base rates or rate stabilization filings in the last three years.\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure has IMR mechanisms in North Carolina and Tennessee designed to separately track and recover certain costs associated with capital investments incurred to comply with federal pipeline safety and integrity programs. The following table summarizes information related to the recently approved IMR filing.\nIn Piedmont's Tennessee rate case settled in February 2021, the Company included projected IMR investment through December 31, 2021, in its rate base. The recovery of integrity investment was requested in the rate case and not through the Tennessee IMR mechanism.\nFor more information on rate matters and other regulatory proceedings, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cRegulatory Matters.\u201d\nFederal\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure is subject to various federal regulations, including regulations that are particular to the natural gas industry. These federal regulations include but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022Regulations of the FERC affect the certification and siting of new interstate natural gas pipeline projects, the purchase and sale of, the prices paid for, and the terms and conditions of service for the interstate transportation and storage of natural gas.\n\u2022Regulations of the PHMSA affect the design, construction, operation, maintenance, integrity, safety and security of natural gas distribution and transmission systems.\n\u2022Regulations of the EPA relate to the environment including proposed air emissions regulations that would expand to include emissions of methane.\nRegulations of the FERC and the state gas utility commissions govern access to regulated natural gas and other data by nonregulated entities and services provided between regulated and nonregulated energy affiliates. These regulations affect the activities of nonregulated affiliates with Gas Utilities and Infrastructure.\nEnvironmental\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure is subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA and state and local environmental agencies. For a discussion of environmental regulation, see \u201cEnvironmental Matters\u201d in this section. See \u201cOther Matters\u201d section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for a discussion about potential Global Climate Change legislation and other EPA regulations under development and the potential impacts such legislation and regulation could have on Duke Energy\u2019s operations.\nCOMMERCIAL RENEWABLES\nCommercial Renewables primarily acquires, develops, builds, operates and owns wind and solar renewable generation throughout the continental U.S. The portfolio includes nonregulated renewable energy and energy storage businesses.\nCommercial Renewables' renewable energy includes utility-scale wind and solar generation assets, distributed solar generation assets, distributed fuel cell assets and battery storage projects, which total 2,763 MW across 21 states from 21 wind facilities, 150 solar projects, 70 fuel cell locations and two battery storage facilities. Revenues are primarily generated by selling the power produced from renewable generation through long-term contracts to utilities, electric cooperatives, municipalities and corporate customers. In most instances, these customers have obligations under state-mandated renewable energy portfolio standards or similar state or local renewable energy goals. Energy and renewable energy credits generated by wind and solar projects are generally sold at contractual prices. The following map shows the locations of renewable generation facilities of which Commercial Renewables has an ownership interest as of December 31, 2020.\nAs eligible projects are placed in service, Commercial Renewables recognizes either PTCs as power is generated by wind projects over 10 years or ITCs when the renewable solar or fuel cell project achieves commercial availability. ITCs are recognized over the useful life of the asset as a reduction to depreciation expense. Benefits of the tax basis adjustment due to the ITC are recognized in income in the year of commercial availability. The ITC for solar and fuel cells is being phased down from a rate of 30% for projects that began construction before 2020 to a permanent 10% rate for solar and no ITC available for fuel cells if construction begins after 2023. The PTC is being phased out and wind turbines will earn 10 years of PTCs at phased-out rates if construction begins in 2017 through 2021.\nCommercial Renewables has entered into agreements for certain of its generating assets that are held by LLCs whose members include a noncontrolling tax equity investor. The allocation of tax attributes and cash flows to the tax equity investor are governed by the provisions of the LLC agreements. The GAAP earnings allocations to the tax equity investors can result in variability in earnings to Duke Energy as a result of the application of the HLBV method in allocating income or loss to the owners. As part of its growth strategy, Commercial Renewables expects to enter into these arrangements for future generating assets.\nFor additional information on Commercial Renewables' generation facilities, see Item 2, \u201cProperties.\u201d\nMarket Environment and Competition\nCommercial Renewables primarily competes for wholesale contracts for the generation and sale of electricity from generation assets it either develops or acquires and owns. The market price of commodities and services, along with the quality and reliability of services provided, drive competition in the wholesale energy business. The number and type of competitors may vary based on location, generation type and project size. Commercial Renewables' main competitors include other nonregulated generators and wholesale power providers.\nSources of Electricity\nCommercial Renewables relies on wind, solar, fuel cells and battery resources for its generation of electric energy.\nRegulation\nCommercial Renewables is subject to regulation at the federal level, primarily from the FERC. Regulations of the FERC govern access to regulated market information by nonregulated entities and services provided between regulated and nonregulated utilities.\nOTHER\nThe remainder of Duke Energy\u2019s operations is presented as Other. While it is not a business segment, Other primarily includes interest expense on holding company debt, unallocated corporate costs including costs to achieve strategic acquisitions, amounts related to certain companywide initiatives and contributions made to the Duke Energy Foundation. Other also includes Bison and an investment in NMC.\nThe Duke Energy Foundation is a nonprofit organization funded by Duke Energy shareholders that makes charitable contributions to selected nonprofits and government subdivisions.\nBison, a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy, is a captive insurance company with the principal activity of providing Duke Energy subsidiaries with indemnification for financial losses primarily related to property, workers\u2019 compensation and general liability.\nDuke Energy owns a 17.5% equity interest in NMC. The joint venture company has production facilities in Jubail, Saudi Arabia, where it manufactures certain petrochemicals and plastics. The company annually produces approximately 1 million metric tons each of MTBE and methanol and has the capacity to produce 50,000 metric tons of polyacetal. The main feedstocks to produce these products are natural gas and butane. Duke Energy records the investment activity of NMC using the equity method of accounting and retains 25% of NMC's board of directors' representation and voting rights.\nHuman Capital Management\nGovernance\nOur employees are critical to the success of our company. Our Human Resources organization is responsible for our human capital management strategy, which includes recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, diversity and inclusion, workforce planning, talent and succession planning, performance management and employee development. Key areas of focus include fostering a high-performance and inclusive culture built on strong leadership and highly engaged and diverse employees, building a pipeline of skilled workers and ensuring knowledge transfer as employees retire.\nOur Board of Directors provides oversight on certain human capital management matters, primarily through the Compensation and People Development Committee, which is responsible for reviewing strategies and policies related to human capital management, including with respect to matters such as diversity and inclusion, employee engagement and talent development. The Compensation and People Development Committee also receives updates on employee engagement surveys and action plans.\nEmployees\nOn December 31, 2020, Duke Energy had a total of 27,535 full-time, part-time and temporary employees, the overwhelming majority of which were full-time employees. The total includes 5,165 employees who are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements that generally cover wages, benefits, working practices, and other terms and conditions of employment.\nCompensation\nThe company seeks to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce and leverages Duke Energy\u2019s leadership imperatives to foster a culture focused on customers, innovation, and highly engaged employees. Our compensation program is designed to link pay to performance with the goal of attracting and retaining talented employees, rewarding individual performance, encouraging long-term commitment to our business, and aligning the interests of our management team with those of key stakeholders, including shareholders and customers. In addition to competitive base pay, we provide eligible employees with compensation and benefits under a variety of plans and programs, including with respect to health care benefits, retirement savings, pension, health savings and flexible spending accounts, wellness, family leaves, employee assistance, as well as other benefits including a charitable matching program. We supplement our pay for performance program with a number of compensation policies that are aligned with the long-term interests of Duke Energy and our shareholders, including a short-term incentive plan and a long-term incentive plan for eligible employees.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nDuke Energy is committed to continuing to build a diverse workforce that reflects the communities we serve while strengthening a culture of inclusion where employees and customers feel respected and valued. Our Enterprise Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Council, which is chaired by our Chief Operating Officer, is responsible for reviewing our diversity and inclusion initiatives for continuous improvement, as well as helping to develop actionable outcomes and results. We have established aspirational goals with respect to diversity and inclusion, and we regularly report our progress toward achieving those goals. Our aspirational goals include achieving a workforce representation of at least 25% female and 20% racial and ethnic diversity. As of December 31, 2020, our workforce consisted of approximately 23% female and 18% racial and ethnic diversity.\nThe company also has a number of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which are networks of employees formed around a common dimension of diversity whose goals and objectives align with the company's goals and objectives. These groups focus on employee professional development and networking, community outreach, cultural awareness, recruiting and retention. They also serve as a resource to the company for advocacy and community outreach and improving customer service through innovation. ERG-sponsored forums include networking events, mentoring, scholarship banquets for aspiring college students, and workshops on topics such as time management, stress reduction, career planning and work-life balance. Our ERGs are open to all employees.\nAmong other efforts, the company has developed partnerships with community organizations, community colleges and historically black colleges and universities to support our strategy of building a diverse and highly skilled talent pipeline.\nOperational Excellence\nThe foundation for our growth and success is our continued focus on operational excellence, the leading indicator of which is safety. As such, the safety of our workforce remains our top priority. The company closely monitors the Total Incident Case Rate (TICR), which is a metric based on strict OSHA definitions that measures the number of occupational injuries and illnesses per 100 employees. This objective emphasizes our focus on achieving an event-free and injury-free workplace. As an indication of our commitment to safety, we include safety metrics in both the short-term and long-term incentive plans based on the TICR for employees. Our employees delivered strong safety results in 2020, consistent with our industry-leading performance levels from 2016 through 2019.\nCOVID-19 Response\nSafety continued to be of paramount importance during the COVID-19 pandemic and included executing on robust business continuity plans that helped ensure critical functions continued to operate under a broad range of circumstances while maintaining a safe work environment. Actions included the following:\n\u2022Engaged our environmental, health and safety experts to develop new safety protocols for thousands of essential workers\n\u2022Quickly transitioned thousands of employees to virtual status\n\u2022Added bandwidth for our information technology systems, reviewed inventory in supply chain, implemented a series of surveys to get employee input, and provided ongoing communications to keep them informed as conditions evolved\n\u2022Created a cross-functional COVID-19 case management team to track and disposition positive cases, ensure appropriate contact tracing and compliance with quarantine and safe return to work requirements\n\u2022Ensured power plants and electricity and natural gas delivery facilities were staffed, helping safeguard dependable service to customers\n\u2022Implemented stringent preventive measures in alignment with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) guidance to help keep employees and customers safe and help ensure we had adequate resources to maintain reliability\nThe company also provided additional benefits to support our workforce throughout the pandemic, including:\n\u202260 hours of additional personal time off to employees who experienced a disruption in dependent care due to school, daycare or other dependent care issues\n\u2022A $1,500 stipend to assist with unplanned expenses resulting from costs related to COVID-19 to employees at a certain pay threshold\n\u2022Donated more than $550,000 to the Relief4Employees program, which is a fund that employees can draw upon for short-term financial help during times of personal need\nInformation about Our Executive Officers\nThe following table sets forth the individuals who currently serve as executive officers. Executive officers serve until their successors are duly elected or appointed.\n(a) The ages of the officers provided are as of January 31, 2021.\nThere are no family relationships between any of the executive officers, nor any arrangement or understanding between any executive officer and any other person involved in officer selection.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations with regard to air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters.

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other disclosures within this Form 10-K, including \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Matters Impacting Future Results\" for each registrant in Item 7, and other documents filed with the SEC from time to time, the following factors should be considered in evaluating Duke Energy and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to differ substantially from those currently expected or sought. Unless otherwise indicated, risk factors discussed below generally relate to risks associated with all of the Duke Energy Registrants. Risks identified at the Subsidiary Registrant level are generally applicable to Duke Energy.\nBUSINESS STRATEGY RISKS\nDuke Energy\u2019s future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to implement its business strategy.\nDuke Energy\u2019s results of operations depend, in significant part, on the extent to which it can implement its business strategy successfully. Duke Energy's strategy, which includes transforming the customer experience, achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, modernizing the regulatory construct and digital transformation, is subject to business, regulatory, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, and required advancements in technology to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, many of which are beyond its control. As a consequence, Duke Energy may not be able to fully implement or realize the anticipated results of its strategy.\nREGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE AND LEGAL RISKS\nThe Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 regulated utility revenues, earnings and results are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution and related activities, which may limit their ability to recover costs.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 regulated electric and natural gas utility businesses are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Tennessee, Indiana and Kentucky. If the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the state utility commissions, retail electric and natural gas rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the Commissions, which may decrease the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 earnings. Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service, or do not do so on a timely basis, the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 earnings could be negatively impacted.\nIf legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 exclusive rights to serve their regulated customers were eroded, their earnings could be negatively impacted. Federal and state regulations, laws and other efforts designed to promote and expand the use of EE measures and distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, in Duke Energy service territories could result in customers leaving the electric distribution system and an increase in customer net energy metering, which allows customers with private solar to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail amount. Over time, customer adoption of these technologies and increased EE could result in excess generation resources as well as stranded costs if Duke Energy is not able to fully recover the costs and investment in generation.\nState regulators have approved various mechanisms to stabilize natural gas utility margins, including margin decoupling in North Carolina and rate stabilization in South Carolina. State regulators have approved other margin stabilizing mechanisms that, for example, allow for recovery of margin losses associated with negotiated transactions designed to retain large volume customers that could use alternative fuels or that may otherwise directly access natural gas supply through their own connection to an interstate pipeline. If regulators decided to discontinue the Duke Energy Registrants' use of tariff mechanisms, it would negatively impact results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, regulatory authorities also review whether natural gas costs are prudently incurred and can disallow the recovery of a portion of natural gas costs that the Duke Energy Registrants seek to recover from customers, which would adversely impact earnings.\nThe rates that the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 regulated utility businesses are allowed to charge are established by state utility commissions in rate case proceedings, which may limit their ability to recover costs and earn an appropriate return on investment.\nThe rates that the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 regulated utility business are allowed to charge significantly influences the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. The regulation of the rates that the regulated utility businesses charge customers is determined, in large part, by state utility commissions in rate case proceedings. Negative decisions made by these regulators, or by any court on appeal of a rate case proceeding, could have a material adverse effect on the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 results of operations, financial position or cash flows and affect the ability of the Duke Energy Registrants to recover costs and an appropriate return on the significant infrastructure investments being made.\nDeregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs that could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 results of operations, financial position or cash flows and their utility businesses.\nIncreased competition resulting from deregulation or restructuring legislation could have a significant adverse impact on the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 results of operations, financial position or cash flows. If the retail jurisdictions served by the Duke Energy Registrants become subject to deregulation, the impairment of assets, loss of retail customers, lower profit margins or increased costs of capital, and recovery of stranded costs could have a significant adverse financial impact on the Duke Energy Registrants. Stranded costs primarily include the generation assets of the Duke Energy Registrants whose value in a competitive marketplace may be less than their current book value, as well as above-market purchased power commitments from QFs from whom the Duke Energy Registrants are legally obligated to purchase energy at an avoided cost rate under PURPA. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the extent and timing of entry by additional competitors into the electric markets. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict if or when they will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, nor can they predict the impact of these changes on their results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation and a wide variety of laws and governmental policies, including taxes, that may change over time in ways that affect operations and costs.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to regulations under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state regulations and policies, including by FERC, NRC, EPA and various other federal agencies as well as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. Regulation affects almost every aspect of the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 businesses, including, among other things, their ability to: take fundamental business management actions; determine the terms and rates of transmission and distribution services; make acquisitions; issue equity or debt securities; engage in transactions with other subsidiaries and affiliates; and pay dividends upstream to the Duke Energy Registrants. Changes to federal regulations are continuous and ongoing. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that result in material modifications of business models and objectives or affect returns on investment by restricting activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs, causing delays, or prohibiting them outright.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations requiring significant capital expenditures that can increase the cost of operations, and which may impact or limit business plans, or cause exposure to environmental liabilities.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations, including CCRs, air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. These laws and regulations generally require the Duke Energy Registrants to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties. Failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets. The steps the Duke Energy Registrants could be required to take to ensure their facilities are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive. As a result, the Duke Energy Registrants may be required to shut down or alter the operation of their facilities, which may cause the Duke Energy Registrants to incur losses. Further, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be successful in recovering capital and operating costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations through existing regulatory rate structures and their contracts with customers. Also, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for their operating assets or development projects. Delays in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, failure to obtain and comply with them or changes in environmental laws or regulations to more stringent compliance levels could result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or development of new facilities being prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. Although it is not expected that the costs to comply with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 results of operations, financial position and cash flows due to regulatory cost recovery, the Duke Energy Registrants are at risk that the costs of complying with environmental regulations in the future will have such an effect.\nThe EPA has enacted or proposed federal regulations governing the management of cooling water intake structures, wastewater and CO2 emissions. New state legislation, including the North Carolina Clean Energy Plan, could impose carbon reduction goals that are more aggressive than the company's plans. These regulations may require the Duke Energy Registrants to make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance costs.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' operations, capital expenditures and financial results may be affected by regulatory changes related to the impacts of global climate change.\nThere is continued concern, and increasing activism, both nationally and internationally, about climate change. The EPA and state regulators may adopt and implement regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs to address global climate change. Increased regulation of GHG emissions could impose significant additional costs on the Duke Energy Registrants' electric and natural gas operations, their suppliers and customers. Regulatory changes could result in generation facilities to be retired early and result in stranded costs if Duke Energy is not able to fully recover the costs and investment in generation, and could also affect demand for energy conservation and renewable products, which could impact our electric and natural gas businesses.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nThe Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 operations have been and may be affected by COVID-19 in ways listed below and in ways the registrants cannot predict at this time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the Duke Energy Registrants' business strategy, results of operations, financial position and cash flows, albeit not materially as of this filing date, from specific activities listed below:\n\u2022Decreased demand for electricity and natural gas;\n\u2022Delays in rate cases and other legal proceedings;\n\u2022An inability to obtain labor or equipment necessary for the construction of generation projects or pipeline expansion;\n\u2022The health and availability of our critical personnel and their ability to perform business functions; and\n\u2022Actions of state utility commissions or federal or state governments to allow customers to suspend or delay payment of bills related to the provision of electric or natural gas services.\nFurthermore, due to the unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s ongoing impact on global health and economic stability, the Duke Energy Registrants expect that the activities listed below could negatively impact their business strategy, results of operations, financial position and cash flows:\n\u2022An inability to procure satisfactory levels of fuels or other necessary equipment to continue production of electricity and delivery of natural gas;\n\u2022An inability to maintain information technology systems and protections from cyberattack;\n\u2022An inability to obtain financing in volatile financial markets;\n\u2022Additional federal regulation tied to stimulus and other aid packages; and\n\u2022Impairment charges, which could include real estate as options for working remotely are evaluated and goodwill.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 results of operations may be negatively affected by overall market, economic and other conditions that are beyond their control.\nSustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the markets in which the Duke Energy Registrants operate and negatively influence operations. Declines in demand for electricity or natural gas as a result of economic downturns in the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 regulated service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity and the use of natural gas. Although the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 regulated electric and natural gas businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs, such as fuel and purchased natural gas costs, under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity or natural gas sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair values.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also sell electricity into the spot market or other competitive power markets on a contractual basis. With respect to such transactions, the Duke Energy Registrants are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investments through mandated rates, and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices. These market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and could reduce the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 revenues and margins, thereby diminishing results of operations.\nFactors that could impact sales volumes, generation of electricity and market prices at which the Duke Energy Registrants are able to sell electricity and natural gas are as follows:\n\u2022weather conditions, including abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower energy or natural gas usage for heating or cooling purposes, as applicable, and periods of low rainfall that decrease the ability to operate facilities in an economical manner;\n\u2022supply of and demand for energy commodities;\n\u2022transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies that impact nonregulated energy operations;\n\u2022availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources, which are preferred by some customers over electricity produced from coal, nuclear or natural gas plants, and customer usage of energy-efficient equipment that reduces energy demand;\n\u2022natural gas, crude oil and refined products production levels and prices;\n\u2022ability to procure satisfactory levels of inventory, such as coal, natural gas and uranium; and\n\u2022capacity and transmission service into, or out of, the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 markets.\nNatural disasters or operational accidents may adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 operating results.\nNatural disasters or other operational accidents within the company or industry (such as forest fires, earthquakes, hurricanes or natural gas transmission pipeline explosions) could have direct or indirect impacts to the Duke Energy Registrants or to key contractors and suppliers. Further, the generation of electricity and the transportation and storage of natural gas involve inherent operating risks that may result in accidents involving serious injury or loss of life, environmental damage or property damage. Such events could impact the Duke Energy Registrants through changes to policies, laws and regulations whose compliance costs have a significant impact on the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, if a serious operational accident were to occur, existing insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred. Any losses not covered by insurance, or any increases in the cost of applicable insurance as a result of such accident, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, cash flows and reputation of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nThe reputation and financial condition of the Duke Energy Registrants could be negatively impacted due to their obligations to comply with federal and state regulations, laws, and other legal requirements that govern the operations, assessments, storage, closure, remediation, disposal and monitoring relating to CCR, the high costs and new rate impacts associated with implementing these new CCR-related requirements and the strategies and methods necessary to implement these requirements in compliance with these legal obligations.\nAs a result of electricity produced for decades at coal-fired power plants, the Duke Energy Registrants manage large amounts of CCR that are primarily stored in dry storage within landfills or combined with water in other surface impoundments, all in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. A CCR-related operational incident could have a material adverse impact on the reputation and results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nDuring 2015, EPA regulations were enacted related to the management of CCR from power plants. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under the RCRA and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and, new and existing surface impoundments, and establish requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, as well as additional legal requirements that may be imposed in the future, such as the settlement reached with the NCDEQ to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina, and partially excavate the remaining two. These federal and state laws, regulations and other legal requirements may require or result in additional expenditures, including increased operating and maintenance costs, which could affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. The Duke Energy Registrants will continue to seek full cost recovery for expenditures through the normal ratemaking process with state and federal utility commissions, who permit recovery in rates of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 regulated operations, and through other wholesale contracts with terms that contemplate recovery of such costs, although there is no guarantee of full cost recovery. In addition, the timing for and amount of recovery of such costs could have a material adverse impact on Duke Energy's cash flows.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants have recognized significant AROs related to these CCR-related requirements. Closure activities began in 2015 at the four sites specified as priority by the Coal Ash Act and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of CCR materials to off-site locations for use as structural fill, to appropriate engineered off-site or on-site lined landfills or conversion of the ash for beneficial use. Duke Energy has completed excavation of coal ash at three of the four high priority sites. At other sites, planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs, and closure activities have commenced. As the closure and CCR management work progresses and final closure plans and corrective action measures are developed and approved at each site, the scope and complexity of work and the amount of CCR material could be greater than estimates and could, therefore, materially increase compliance expenditures and rate impacts.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand or number of customers.\nGrowth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by several factors outside the control of the Duke Energy Registrants, such as mandated EE measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.\nCertain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of EE in end-use electric devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.\nAdvances in distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and solar cells, may reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level competitive with central power station electric production utilized by the Duke Energy Registrants.\nSome or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers and may cause the failure of the Duke Energy Registrants to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nFurthermore, the Duke Energy Registrants currently have EE riders in place to recover the cost of EE programs in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Should the Duke Energy Registrants be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants future results may be impacted by changing customer expectations and demands including heightened emphasis on environmental, social and governance concerns.\nDuke Energy\u2019s outcomes are influenced by the expectations of our customers and stakeholders. Those expectations are based on the core fundamentals of reliability and affordability but are also increasingly focused on our ability to meet rapidly changing demands for new and varied products, services and offerings. Additionally, the risks of global climate change continues to shape our customers\u2019 sustainability goals and energy needs. Failure to meet those expectations or to adequately address the risks and external pressures from regulators, investors and other stakeholders may impact favorable outcomes in future rate cases and the results of operations for the Duke Energy Registrants.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be negatively affected by changes in weather conditions and severe weather, including extreme weather conditions associated with climate change.\nElectric power generation and natural gas distribution are generally seasonal businesses. In most parts of the U.S., the demand for power peaks during the warmer summer months, with market prices also typically peaking at that time. In other areas, demand for power peaks during the winter. Demand for natural gas peaks during the winter months. Further, extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, droughts, heat waves, winter storms and severe weather associated with climate change could cause these seasonal fluctuations to be more pronounced. As a result, the overall operating results of the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 businesses may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make period-to-period comparison less relevant.\nSustained severe drought conditions could impact generation by hydroelectric plants, as well as fossil and nuclear plant operations, as these facilities use water for cooling purposes and for the operation of environmental compliance equipment. Furthermore, destruction caused by severe weather events, such as hurricanes, flooding, tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, snow and ice storms, can result in lost operating revenues due to outages, property damage, including downed transmission and distribution lines, and additional and unexpected expenses to mitigate storm damage. The cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 sales may decrease if they are unable to gain adequate, reliable and affordable access to transmission assets.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver electricity sold to the wholesale market. The FERC\u2019s power transmission regulations require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. If transmission is disrupted, or if transmission capacity is inadequate, the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 ability to sell and deliver products may be hindered.\nThe different regional power markets have changing regulatory structures, which could affect growth and performance in these regions. In addition, the ISOs who oversee the transmission systems in regional power markets have imposed in the past, and may impose in the future, price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets. These types of price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely impact the profitability of the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 wholesale power marketing business.\nThe availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas supply may decrease.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants purchase almost all of their natural gas supply from interstate sources that must be transported to the applicable service territories. Interstate pipeline companies transport the natural gas to the Duke Energy Registrants' systems under firm service agreements that are designed to meet the requirements of their core markets. A significant disruption to interstate pipelines capacity or reduction in natural gas supply due to events including, but not limited to, operational failures or disruptions, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, freeze off of natural gas wells, terrorist or cyberattacks or other acts of war or legislative or regulatory actions or requirements, including remediation related to integrity inspections, could reduce the normal interstate supply of natural gas and thereby reduce earnings. Moreover, if additional natural gas infrastructure, including, but not limited to, exploration and drilling rigs and platforms, processing and gathering systems, offshore pipelines, interstate pipelines and storage, cannot be built at a pace that meets demand, then growth opportunities could be limited.\nFluctuations in commodity prices or availability may adversely affect various aspects of the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 operations as well as their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal, fuel oil, nuclear fuel, electricity and other energy-related commodities as a result of their ownership of energy-related assets. Fuel costs are recovered primarily through cost-recovery clauses, subject to the approval of state utility commissions.\nAdditionally, the Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to risk that counterparties will not be able to fulfill their obligations. Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of, among other things, bankruptcies, transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, could limit the Duke Energy Registrants' ability to operate their facilities. Should counterparties fail to perform, the Duke Energy Registrants might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at prevailing market prices possibly resulting in losses in addition to the amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties.\nCertain of the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 hedge agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting of, collateral with counterparties, depending on the daily market-based calculation of financial exposure of the derivative positions. Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the return of collateral received and/or the posting of collateral with counterparties could negatively impact liquidity. Downgrades in the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 credit ratings could lead to additional collateral posting requirements. The Duke Energy Registrants continually monitor derivative positions in relation to market price activity.\nCyberattacks and data security breaches could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants' businesses.\nCybersecurity risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication, magnitude and frequency of cyberattacks and data security breaches. Duke Energy relies on the continued operation of sophisticated digital information technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of an interconnected regional grid. Additionally, connectivity to the internet continues to increase through grid modernization and other operational excellence initiatives. Because of the critical nature of the infrastructure, increased connectivity to the internet and technology systems\u2019 inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism or other types of data security breaches, the Duke Energy Registrants face a heightened risk of cyberattack from foreign or domestic sources and have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized access to information and/or information systems or to disrupt utility operations through computer viruses and phishing attempts either directly or indirectly through its material vendors or related third parties. In the event of a significant cybersecurity breach on either the Duke Energy Registrants or with one of our material vendors or related third parties, the Duke Energy Registrants could (i) have business operations disrupted, including the disruption of the operation of our assets and the power grid, theft of confidential company, employee, retiree, shareholder, vendor or customer information, and general business systems and process interruption or compromise, including preventing the Duke Energy Registrants from servicing customers, collecting revenues or the recording, processing and/or reporting financial information correctly, (ii) experience substantial loss of revenues, repair and restoration costs, penalties and costs for lack of compliance with relevant regulations, implementation costs for additional security measures to avert future cyberattacks and other financial loss and (iii) be subject to increased regulation, litigation and reputational damage. While Duke Energy maintains insurance relating to cybersecurity events, such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may be insufficient to offset any losses, costs or damage experienced. Also, the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events is evolving as the industry matures.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to standards enacted by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by FERC regarding protection of the physical and cyber security of critical infrastructure assets required for operating North America's bulk electric system. The Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to regulations set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding the protection of digital computer and communication systems and networks required for the operation of nuclear power plants. While the Duke Energy Registrants believe they are in compliance with such standards and regulations, the Duke Energy Registrants have from time to time been, and may in the future be, found to be in violation of such standards and regulations. In addition, compliance with or changes in the applicable standards and regulations may subject the Duke Energy Registrants to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures as well as substantial fines for non-compliance.\nDuke Energy Ohio\u2019s and Duke Energy Indiana\u2019s membership in an RTO presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe rules governing the various regional power markets may change, which could affect Duke Energy Ohio\u2019s and Duke Energy Indiana\u2019s costs and/or revenues. To the degree Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana incur significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in an RTO, their results of operations may be impacted. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be allocated a portion of the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in RTO transmission rate design. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be required to expand their transmission system according to decisions made by an RTO rather than their own internal planning process. In addition, RTOs have been developing rules associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning costs associated with improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights that may have a financial impact on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana.\nAs members of an RTO, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are subject to certain additional risks, including those associated with the allocation among RTO members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in the RTO markets and those associated with complaint cases filed against an RTO that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by RTO members.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled.\nDuke Energy\u2019s long-term strategy requires the construction of new projects, either wholly owned or partially owned, which involve a number of risks, including construction delays, nonperformance by equipment and other third-party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs. To limit the risks of these construction projects, the Duke Energy Registrants enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits. If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur. In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs.\nThe financial condition of some insurance companies, actual or threatened physical or cyberattacks, and natural disasters, among other things, could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. The availability of insurance covering risks that the Duke Energy Registrants and their respective competitors typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance that the Duke Energy Registrants are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms. Further, the insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred. Any losses not covered by insurance, or any increases in the cost of applicable insurance, could adversely affect the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the affected Duke Energy Registrant.\nNUCLEAR GENERATION RISKS\nDuke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida may incur substantial costs and liabilities due to their ownership and operation of nuclear generating facilities.\nOwnership interests in and operation of nuclear stations by Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida subject them to various risks. These risks include, among other things: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the current or past operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.\nOwnership and operation of nuclear generation facilities requires compliance with licensing and safety-related requirements imposed by the NRC. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines or shut down a unit depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation. Revised security and safety requirements promulgated by the NRC, which could be prompted by, among other things, events within or outside of the control of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, such as a serious nuclear incident at a facility owned by a third party, could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures, as well as assessments to cover third-party losses. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, cash flows and reputation of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND COMMON STOCK RISKS\nThe Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term borrowings and longer-term debt and equity markets to finance their capital requirements and support their liquidity needs. Access to those markets can be adversely affected by a number of conditions, many of which are beyond the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 control.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 businesses are significantly financed through issuances of debt and equity. The maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from their assets. Accordingly, as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flows from their operations and to fund investments originally financed through debt instruments with disparate maturities, the Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term money markets as well as longer-term capital markets. The Subsidiary Registrants also rely on access to short-term intercompany borrowings. If the Duke Energy Registrants are not able to access debt or equity at competitive rates or at all, the ability to finance their operations and implement their strategy and business plan as scheduled could be adversely affected. An inability to access debt and equity may limit the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that they may otherwise rely on for future growth.\nMarket disruptions may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include: economic downturns, the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company, unfavorable capital market conditions, market prices for electricity and natural gas, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, or the overall health of the energy industry. The availability of credit under Duke Energy\u2019s Master Credit Facility depends upon the ability of the banks providing commitments under the facility to provide funds when their obligations to do so arise. Systematic risk of the banking system and the financial markets could prevent a bank from meeting its obligations under the facility agreement.\nDuke Energy maintains a revolving credit facility to provide backup for its commercial paper program and letters of credit to support variable rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrant issuer at the option of the holder. The facility includes borrowing sublimits for the Duke Energy Registrants, each of whom is a party to the credit facility, and financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of the total capital for the specific entity. Failure to maintain these covenants at a particular entity could preclude Duke Energy from issuing commercial paper or the Duke Energy Registrants from issuing letters of credit or borrowing under the Master Credit Facility.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants must meet credit quality standards and there is no assurance they will maintain investment grade credit ratings. If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain investment grade credit ratings, they would be required under credit agreements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which may materially adversely affect their liquidity.\nEach of the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 senior long-term debt issuances is currently rated investment grade by various rating agencies. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot ensure their senior long-term debt will be rated investment grade in the future.\nIf the rating agencies were to rate the Duke Energy Registrants below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, perhaps significantly. In addition, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease. Further, if the short-term debt rating were to fall, access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited.\nA downgrade below investment grade could also require the posting of additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash under various credit, commodity and capacity agreements and trigger termination clauses in some interest rate derivative agreements, which would require cash payments. All of these events would likely reduce the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 liquidity and profitability and could have a material effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nNon-compliance with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 ability to execute future borrowings.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements.\nMarket performance and other changes may decrease the value of the NDTF investments of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, which then could require significant additional funding.\nOwnership and operation of nuclear generation facilities also requires the maintenance of funded trusts that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of the respective nuclear power plants. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy these future obligations. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below projected rates of return. Although a number of factors impact funding requirements, a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations for decommissioning nuclear plants. If Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are unable to successfully manage their NDTF assets, their results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected.\nPoor investment performance of the Duke Energy pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 liquidity and results of operations.\nThe costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation and required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. The Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and obligations related to these plans. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of plan assets and, depending upon the other factors impacting costs as listed above, Duke Energy could be required to fund its plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations, and the Subsidiary Registrants\u2019 proportionate share of such cash funding obligations, could have a material impact on the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nDuke Energy is a holding company and depends on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations.\nBecause Duke Energy is a holding company with no operations or cash flows of its own, its ability to meet its financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock, is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay borrowed funds. Prior to funding Duke Energy, its subsidiaries have regulatory restrictions and financial obligations that must be satisfied. These subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide Duke Energy with funds. In addition, Duke Energy may provide capital contributions or debt financing to its subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet its financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividends on Duke Energy\u2019s common stock.\nGENERAL RISKS\nThe failure of Duke Energy information technology systems, or the failure to enhance existing information technology systems and implement new technology, could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 businesses.\nDuke Energy\u2019s operations are dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal systems, including the information technology systems that support our underlying business processes. Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems may result in disruptions of our operations. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology systems, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) proprietary business information, (iii) personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, retirees and shareholders and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply chain activities. Our information technology systems are dependent upon global communications and cloud service providers, as well as their respective vendors, many of whom have at some point experienced significant system failures and outages in the past and may experience such failures and outages in the future. These providers\u2019 systems are susceptible to cybersecurity and data breaches, outages from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss from system failures or outages could materially affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nIn addition to maintaining our current information technology systems, Duke Energy believes the digital transformation of its business is key to driving internal efficiencies as well as providing additional capabilities to customers. Duke Energy\u2019s information technology systems are critical to cost-effective, reliable daily operations and our ability to effectively serve our customers. We expect our customers to continue to demand more sophisticated technology-driven solutions and we must enhance or replace our information technology systems in response. This involves significant development and implementation costs to keep pace with changing technologies and customer demand. If we fail to successfully implement critical technology, or if it does not provide the anticipated benefits or meet customer demands, such failure could materially adversely affect our business strategy as well as impact the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nPotential terrorist activities, or military or other actions, could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 businesses.\nThe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the U.S. and its allies may lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas and oil, which may have material adverse effects in ways the Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict at this time. In addition, future acts of terrorism and possible reprisals as a consequence of action by the U.S. and its allies could be directed against companies operating in the U.S. Information technology systems, transmission and distribution and generation facilities such as nuclear plants could be potential targets of terrorist activities or harmful activities by individuals or groups that could have a material adverse effect on Duke Energy Registrants' businesses. In particular, the Duke Energy Registrants may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for their information technology systems, transmission and distribution and generation facilities, including nuclear power plants under the NRC\u2019s design basis threat requirements. These increased costs could include additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 results of operations.\nCertain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the lengthy time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may increase. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business, especially considering the workforce needs associated with nuclear generation facilities and new skills required to operate a modernized, technology-enabled power grid. If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected.",

Duke Energy operates in the U.S. primarily through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. When discussing Duke Energy\u2019s consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of the Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.\nExecutive Overview\nAt Duke Energy the fundamentals of our business are strong and allow us to deliver growth in earnings and dividends in a low-risk, predictable and transparent way. In 2020, we met our near-term financial commitments and continued to provide safe and reliable service while managing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn early 2021, we continued to position the company for sustainable long-term growth, executing an important coal ash settlement agreement in North Carolina and announcing the $2 billion sale of a minority interest in Duke Energy Indiana, providing a source of efficient capital at an attractive valuation. We remain focused on a business portfolio that will deliver a reliable and growing dividend with 2020 representing the 94th consecutive year Duke Energy paid a cash dividend on its common stock. With these recent announcements, we also increased our long-term adjusted EPS growth rate to 5% to 7% through 2025. This growth is supported by our $59 billion capital plan from 2021 to 2025, clean energy investments that benefit our customers, timely cost-recovery mechanisms in most jurisdictions and our ability to effectively manage our cost structure.\nFinancial Results\n(a)See Results of Operations below for Duke Energy\u2019s definition of adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS as well as a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income available to Duke Energy and net income available to Duke Energy per basic share.\nDuke Energy's 2020 Net Income Available to Duke Energy Corporation (GAAP Reported Earnings) were impacted by: regulatory settlements related to coal ash cost recovery in Electric Utilities and Infrastructure; the cancellation of the ACP pipeline in Gas Utilities and Infrastructure; and growth in project investments in Commercial Renewables. See \u201cResults of Operations\u201d below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations and a detailed discussion of financial results for each of Duke Energy\u2019s reportable business segments, as well as Other.\n2020 Areas of Focus and Accomplishments\nClean Energy Transformation. Our industry has been undergoing an incredible transformation and 2020 was a milestone year for our company where we articulated a clear vision for the future and outlined investments to achieve a clean energy future for our customers. We continue to transform the customer experience by generating cleaner energy, modernizing the energy grid, and expanding natural gas infrastructure.\nGenerating Cleaner Energy\nIn October 2020, we held our first-ever Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Day for investors, successfully outlining our climate strategy and highlighting our strong progress to date in reducing carbon (a greater than 40% reduction from 2005) and our commitment to do more (at least 50% reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050). In the Carolinas, we participated in extensive stakeholder processes focused on carbon reduction and regulatory reform and filed comprehensive IRP consistent with that strategy. Our planned coal retirements and transition to cleaner energy sources in the Carolinas are some of the largest in the industry. We also committed to an all-electric light-duty fleet and 50% of all medium- and heavy-duty vehicles by 2030 - a pledge that also leads our industry. Our commitment for 2030 includes retiring plants, operating our existing carbon-free resources and investing in renewables, our energy delivery system, and natural gas infrastructure. As we look beyond 2030, we will need additional tools to continue our progress. We will work actively to advocate for research and development of carbon-free, dispatchable resources. That includes longer-duration energy storage, advanced nuclear technologies, carbon capture and zero-carbon fuels.\nModernizing the Power Grid\nOur grid improvement programs continue to be a key component of our growth strategy. Modernization of the electric grid, including smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing and targeted undergrounding, helps to ensure the system is better prepared for severe weather, improves the system's reliability and flexibility, and provides better information and services for customers. In 2020, 98% of our jurisdictions were equipped with smart meters and we remain on track to be fully deployed across all regions by the end of this year. We continue to expand our self-optimizing grid capabilities, and in 2020, smart, self-healing technologies helped to avoid more than 800,000 extended customer outages across our six-state electric service area, saving customers more than 1.8 million hours of lost outage time. Duke Energy also has a demonstrated track record of driving efficiencies and productivity into the business and we continue to leverage new technology, digital tools and data analytics across the business in response to a transforming landscape.\nExpanding Natural Gas Infrastructure\nIn July 2020, Duke Energy and Dominion announced the cancellation of the ACP pipeline. Litigation risks and delays presented too much uncertainty on our ability to economically complete the project on schedule to meet our customers\u2019 needs. Additionally, Dominion reached a decision to exit their natural gas transmission business, further impeding our ability to consider ongoing investment in the project. The Company remains committed to pursuing natural gas infrastructure investments and continues to explore additional resources in eastern North Carolina for the Piedmont system and securing more transport capacity to support power generation. Construction is expected to be completed this year on a liquefied natural gas facility in Robeson County, North Carolina, on property Piedmont owns. This investment will help Piedmont provide a reliable gas supply to customers during peak usage periods and protect customers from price volatility when there is a higher-than-normal demand for natural gas. In the fall of 2020, recognizing the continued importance of natural gas to our plans, we announced a net-zero methane emission goal by 2030 related to our gas distribution business, as well as our commitment to lead on reduction of upstream methane emissions through work with our natural gas supply chain.\nConstructive Regulatory and Legislative Outcomes. One of our long-term strategic goals is to achieve modernized regulatory constructs in our jurisdictions. Modernized constructs provide benefits, which include improved earnings and cash flows through more timely recovery of investments, as well as stable pricing for customers.\nIn 2020, we conducted the bulk of proceedings related to our North Carolina rate cases for both Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress and achieved a partial settlement with the North Carolina Public Staff and ten other intervening parties. In January 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress reached an important settlement agreement, which subject to NCUC approval, resolves historical coal ash prudence and cost recovery issues and provides clarity on coal ash cost recovery for the next decade. In 2020, we also achieved constructive rate case outcomes in Indiana (our first rate base request in 15 years) and Kentucky (electric). We have a multiyear rate plan in Florida and in January 2021 reached a constructive settlement agreement with key consumer groups, subject to FPSC approval, to bring additional certainty to rates through 2024, In addition, grid investment riders in the Midwest enable more timely cost recovery and earnings growth.\nCustomer Satisfaction. Duke Energy continues to transform the customer experience through our use of customer data to better inform operational priorities and performance levels. This data-driven approach allows us to identify the investments that are the most important to the customer experience. Our work has been recognized by our customers with external measures showing Duke Energy is improving customer satisfaction at a rate greater than the utility industry. Additionally, in 2020, we surpassed our internal target that measures customer satisfaction by approximately 14%.\nOperational Excellence, Safety and Reliability. The reliable and safe operation of our power plants, electric distribution system and natural gas infrastructure in our communities is foundational to our customers, our financial results and our credibility with stakeholders. Our regulated generation fleet and nuclear sites had strong performance throughout the year and our electric distribution system performed well. The safety of our workforce is a core value. Our employees delivered strong safety results in 2020, and we are at or near the top of our industry. Additionally, the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was incredibly active and marked the fifth consecutive year of above-average damaging storms. Our ability to effectively handle all facets of the 2020 storm response efforts, including navigating COVID-19 protocols, is a testament to our team\u2019s extensive preparation and coordination, applying lessons learned from previous storms, and to on-the-ground management throughout the restoration efforts.\nLeading Through COVID-19. COVID-19 impacted all that we accomplished in 2020 and demonstrated our resiliency and agility:\n\u2022As the pandemic spread, stay-at-home orders coupled with recessionary economic conditions caused overall retail electric sales to decline by approximately 2%. To offset this challenge, as well as mild weather and other COVID-related costs, we successfully achieved the high end of our goal of $400 million to $450 million of broad-based O&M reductions and other mitigating actions. The Company\u2019s results were within its adjusted EPS guidance range and we expect to sustain approximately $200 million of the 2020 O&M cost mitigation into 2021 forward.\n\u2022Duke Energy kept electricity and gas flowing while voluntarily making significant accommodations for our customers. We led the way in our sector nationally, suspending all nonpay disconnects in all jurisdictions and waiving late payment fees and other fees until the national state of emergency was lifted. In the fall, we began returning to normal business practices, ensuring diligent communication with our customers and providing flexible payment arrangements.\n\u2022We ensured the physical safety of our workers and provided support for our employees. As cases spiked nationally, we deployed COVID-19 safety protocols for our front-line essential workers and moved 18,000 colleagues to remote work. Our COVID-19 Case Management Team managed exposures of our workforce and IT ensured our networks could handle the remote work while strengthening cyber protection. Under our COVID-19 protocols, our front-line employees completed 150 fossil and nuclear outages, executed large major projects, restored service from storms and hurricanes, and managed high-water events. Overall, our operations continued, and our team completed their work with excellence.\nDuke Energy Objectives - 2021 and Beyond\nDuke Energy will continue to deliver exceptional value to customers, be an integral part of the communities in which we do business and provide attractive returns to investors. We have an achievable, long-term strategy in place, and it is producing tangible results, yet the industry in which we operate is becoming more and more dynamic. We are adjusting, where necessary, and accelerating our focus in key areas to ensure the company is well positioned to be successful for many decades into the future. As we look ahead to 2021, our plans include:\n\u2022Continuing to place the customer at the center of all that we do, which includes providing customized products and solutions\n\u2022Strengthening our relationships with all our vast stakeholders in the communities in which we operate and invest\n\u2022Generating cleaner energy and working to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and net zero methane emissions by 2030\n\u2022Modernizing and strengthening a green-enabled energy grid\n\u2022Expanding our natural gas infrastructure\n\u2022Maintaining the safety of our communities and employees\n\u2022Deploying digital tools across our business\nMatters Impacting Future Results\nThe matters discussed herein could materially impact the future operating results, financial condition and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants and Business Segments.\nRegulatory Matters\nCoal Ash Costs\nAs a result of the NCDEQ settlement on December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress agreed to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina with ash moved to on-site lined landfills. At the two remaining basins, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. The majority of spend is expected to occur over the next 15-20 years. In January 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress reached a settlement agreement on recovery of coal ash costs as outlined in Note 3, \"Regulatory Matters,\" which is subject to review and approval of the NCUC. The company agreed not to seek recovery of approximately $1 billion of deferred coal ash expenditures and Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress took a charge of approximately $500 million each.\nIn 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress received orders from the PSCSC denying recovery of certain coal ash costs. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have appealed these decisions to the South Carolina Supreme Court and those appeals are pending. An order from regulatory or judicial authorities that rejects our proposed settlement or disallows recovery of costs related to closure of these ash basins could have an adverse impact on future results.\nDuke Energy Indiana has interpreted the CCR rule to identify the coal ash basin sites impacted and has assessed the amounts of coal ash subject to the rule and a method of compliance. In 2020, the Hoosier Environmental Council filed a petition challenging the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's partial approval of Duke Energy Indiana\u2019s ash pond closure plans. Interpretation of the requirements of the CCR rule is subject to further legal challenges and regulatory approvals, which could result in additional ash basin closure requirements, higher costs of compliance and greater AROs. Additionally, Duke Energy Indiana has retired facilities that are not subject to the CCR rule. Duke Energy Indiana may incur costs at these facilities to comply with environmental regulations or to mitigate risks associated with on-site storage of coal ash.\nStorm Costs\nDuke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida\u2019s service territories were impacted by several named storms in 2018. Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael and Winter Storm Diego caused flooding, extensive damage and widespread power outages to the service territories of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. Duke Energy Florida\u2019s service territory was also impacted by Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 hurricane and the most powerful storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history. In September 2019, Hurricane Dorian impacted Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida's service territories. In 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress reached partial settlements in the 2019 North Carolina rates cases by filing a petition to securitize deferred storm costs, which is subject to review and approval of the NCUC. In January 2021, Duke Energy Florida filed a settlement agreement with the FPSC, which if approved, allows recovery of the remaining storm cost balance for hurricanes Michael and Dorian. An order from regulatory authorities disallowing the deferral and future recovery of storm restoration costs could have an adverse impact.\nGrid Improvement Costs\nDuke Energy Carolinas received an order from the NCUC in 2018, which denied the Grid Rider Stipulation and deferral treatment of grid improvement costs. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have petitioned for deferral of future grid improvement costs in their 2019 rate cases. Partial settlements filed with the NCUC in July 2020 included the allowance for deferral for certain grid projects placed in service from June 2020 through December 2022. There could be adverse impacts if grid improvement costs are not ultimately approved for recovery and/or deferral treatment.\nRate Cases\nIn 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed general rate cases with the NCUC. Several partial settlement agreements have been filed with the NCUC and are awaiting approval. The outcome of these rate cases could have a material impact.\nMGP\nThe PUCO has issued an order authorizing recovery of MGP costs at certain sites in Ohio with a deadline to complete the MGP environmental investigation and remediation work prior to December 31, 2016. This deadline was subsequently extended to December 31, 2019. Duke Energy Ohio has filed for a request for extension of the deadline. A hearing on that request has not been scheduled. Disallowance of costs incurred, failure to complete the work by the deadline or failure to obtain an extension from the PUCO could result in an adverse impact.\nFor additional information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cRegulatory Matters.\u201d\nSale of Minority Interest in Duke Energy Indiana\nIn January 2021, Duke Energy entered into a definitive agreement providing for the sale of a 19.9% minority interest in Duke Energy Indiana with an affiliate of GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund. The sale is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions described in the investment agreement, including receipt of the approval of the FERC and completion of review by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States. Failure to obtain related approvals or satisfy the conditions in the investment agreement could result in the termination of the transaction and could result in an adverse impact. For additional information, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nCommercial Renewables\nDuke Energy continues to monitor recoverability of renewable merchant plants located in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas West market and PJM, due to declining market pricing and declining long-term forecasted energy prices, primarily driven by lower forecasted natural gas prices. Based on the most recent recoverability test, the carrying value approximated the aggregate estimated future undiscounted cash flows for the assets under review. A continued decline in energy market pricing would likely result in a future impairment. Impairment of these assets could result in adverse impacts. For additional information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Property, Plant and Equipment.\"\nIn February 2021, a severe winter storm impacted certain Commercial Renewables assets in Texas. Extreme weather conditions limited the ability for these solar and wind facilities to generate and sell electricity into the Electric Reliability Council of Texas market. Both lost revenues and higher than expected purchased power costs are expected to negatively impact the operating results of these generating units. The estimated financial impact of the storm is expected to have a material impact on the Commercial Renewables segment's 2021 operating results. See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Subsequent Events.\"\nCOVID-19\nDuke Energy cannot predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact its results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future. Duke Energy will continue to actively monitor the impacts of COVID-19 including the economic slowdown caused by business closures or by reduced operations of businesses and governmental agencies. The pandemic and resultant economic slowdown continues to cause an increase in certain costs, such as bad debt, and a reduction in the demand for energy. Duke Energy has mitigation plans in place to partially offset these impacts, and the ability to execute these plans is critical to preserving future financial results.The Company is in the process of reviewing the long-term real estate strategy due to a potential change of in-office work policies after the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan may result in a reduction of physical work space which could create accounting impacts starting in 2021. Accounting impacts may include reassessments of lease terms and lease modifications which could result in termination penalties, as well as, asset impairments on property, plant and equipment. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of risks associated with COVID-19 and Liquidity and Capital Resources within this section for a discussion of liquidity impacts of COVID-19.\nWithin this Item 7, see Liquidity and Capital Resources for a discussion on risks associated with the Tax Act.\nResults of Operations\nNon-GAAP Measures\nManagement evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS. These items represent income from continuing operations available to Duke Energy common stockholders in dollar and per-share amounts, adjusted for the dollar and per-share impact of special items. As discussed below, special items include certain charges and credits, which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy's ongoing performance. Management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy\u2019s performance across periods.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting, and for reporting financial results to the Board of Directors, employees, stockholders, analysts and investors. Adjusted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS are GAAP Reported Earnings and EPS Available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders (GAAP Reported EPS), respectively.\nSpecial items included in the periods presented include the following, which management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:\n\u2022Gas Pipeline Investments represents costs related to the cancellation of the ACP pipeline and additional exit costs related to Constitution.\n\u2022Regulatory Settlements represents charges related to Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' CCR Settlement Agreement and the partial settlements in the 2019 North Carolina rate cases.\n\u2022Severance represents the reversal of 2018 costs, which were deferred as a result of a partial settlement in the Duke Energy Carolinas and the Duke Energy Progress 2019 North Carolina rate cases.\n\u2022Impairment Charges represents a reduction of a prior year impairment at Citrus County CC and an OTTI on the remaining investment in Constitution.\nDuke Energy\u2019s adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner.\nReconciliation of GAAP Reported Amounts to Adjusted Amounts\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n(a) Net of tax benefit of $399 million.\n(b) Net of tax benefit of $263 million.\n(c) Net of tax expense of $23 million.\n(d) Net of tax expense of $3 million.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019\nGAAP Reported EPS was $1.72 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $5.06 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in GAAP Reported Earnings/EPS was primarily due to the cancellation of the ACP pipeline and the CCR Settlement Agreement filed with the NCUC.\nAs discussed and shown in the table above, management also evaluates financial performance based on adjusted EPS. Duke Energy\u2019s adjusted EPS was $5.12 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $5.06 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in Adjusted Earnings/Adjusted EPS was primarily due to positive rate case contributions, growth in wholesale, lower operations and maintenance expense in response to the pandemic and growth in Commercial Renewables, partially offset by higher depreciation expense from a growing asset base, impacts of the pandemic, mild weather and the loss of ACP earnings.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nThe remaining information presented in this discussion of results of operations is on a GAAP basis. Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends. Segment income includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuke Energy's segment structure includes the following segments: Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables. The remainder of Duke Energy\u2019s operations is presented as Other. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cBusiness Segments,\u201d for additional information on Duke Energy\u2019s segment structure.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure\nYear Ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure\u2019s variance is primarily due to impairment charges and revenue reductions related to the CCR settlement agreement filed with the NCUC to resolve coal ash cost recovery issues, unfavorable weather and lower volumes driven by impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by base rate adjustments in various jurisdictions. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.\nOperating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:\n\u2022an $826 million decrease in fuel revenues driven by lower sales volumes as well as an accelerated refund of fuel costs at Duke Energy Florida in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022a $237 million decrease in wholesale revenue primarily driven by the CCR Settlement Agreement filed with the NCUC in January 2021 and decreased volumes;\n\u2022a $207 million decrease in retail sales, net of fuel revenues, due to unfavorable weather;\n\u2022a $130 million decrease in rider revenues from EE programs;\n\u2022a $44 million decrease in nuclear cost recovery rider revenue due to recovery of the Crystal River 3 uprate regulatory asset in 2019 at Duke Energy Florida; and\n\u2022a $17 million decrease in weather-normal retail sale volumes driven by lower nonresidential customer demand due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPartially offset by:\n\u2022a $214 million increase due to higher pricing from the Indiana retail rate case, net of rider revenues;\n\u2022a $92 million increase in retail pricing due to Duke Energy Florida's base rate adjustments related to annual increases from the 2017 Settlement Agreement and the Solar Base Rate Adjustment; and\n\u2022a $32 million increase due to higher pricing from South Carolina retail rate cases, net of a return of EDIT to customers.\nOperating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:\n\u2022a $979 million increase in impairment charges primarily driven by the CCR Settlement Agreement filed with the NCUC in January 2021;\n\u2022a $117 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to additional plant in service and new depreciation rates from the Indiana retail rate cases; and\n\u2022a $13 million increase in property and other taxes primarily due to prior year property tax reassessments.\nPartially offset by:\n\u2022a $776 million decrease in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power primarily due to lower generation demand and lower fuel and natural gas costs; and\n\u2022a $106 million decrease in operation, maintenance and other expense primarily driven by cost mitigation efforts.\nInterest Expense. The variance was primarily due to lower interest rates on outstanding debt.\nIncome Tax Expense. The ETRs for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, were 11.3% and 18.2%, respectively. The decrease in the ETR was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of excess deferred taxes.\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure\nYear Ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure\u2019s results were impacted primarily by the cancellation of the ACP pipeline. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.\nOperating Revenues. The variance was driven primarily by:\n\u2022a $167 million decrease due to lower natural gas costs passed through to customers, lower volumes, and decreased off-system sales natural gas costs; and\n\u2022a $47 million decrease due to return of EDIT to customers.\nPartially offset by:\n\u2022an $87 million increase due to North Carolina base rate case increases.\nOperating Expenses. The variance was driven primarily by:\n\u2022a $167 million decrease in cost of natural gas due to lower natural gas prices, lower volumes and decreased off-system sales natural gas costs.\nEquity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. The variance was driven primarily by the cancellation of the ACP pipeline.\nOther Income and Expenses, net. The variance was driven primarily by AFUDC equity and other income related to Belews Creek and Marshall Power Generation contracts.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense. The increase in tax benefit was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income driven by the impact of the cancellation of the ACP pipeline. The ETRs for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, were 21.6% and 4.8%, respectively. The increase in the ETR was primarily due to an adjustment, recorded in the first quarter of 2019, related to the income tax recognition for equity method investments. The equity method investment adjustment was immaterial and relates to prior years.\nCommercial Renewables\n(a) Certain projects are included in tax-equity structures where investors have differing interests in the project's economic attributes. Amounts shown represent 100% of the tax-equity project's capacity.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019\nCommercial Renewables' results were favorable primarily due to growth of new project investments. Since December 31, 2019, Commercial Renewables has placed in service approximately 500 MW of capacity.\nThe following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.\nOperating Revenues. The variance was primarily driven by a $39 million increase associated with the growth of new projects placed in service, partially offset by a $24 million decrease primarily within the distributed energy portfolios for lower engineering and construction activities related to delays from COVID-19.\nOperating Expenses. The variance was primarily driven by a $52 million increase in operating expenses due to the growth of new projects placed in service. This was partially offset by a $24 million decrease in operating expenses within the distributed energy portfolios for lower engineering and construction costs related to delays from COVID-19.\nInterest Expense. The decrease was primarily driven by non-qualifying hedge activity in the prior year, higher capitalized interest in the current year for solar and wind projects in development and lower outstanding debt balances.\nIncome Tax Benefit. The decrease in the tax benefit was primarily driven by an increase in taxes associated with tax equity investments and a decrease in PTCs generated.\nLoss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. The increase was driven primarily by the growth of new projects financed by tax equity.\nOther\nYear Ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019\nThe variance was primarily driven by a reversal of corporate allocated severance costs, obligations to the Duke Energy Foundation in 2019, and lower state income tax expense, partially offset by lower returns on investments, higher loss experience related to captive insurance claims, the declaration of preferred stock dividends, and lower earnings on the NMC investment. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.\nOperating Expenses. The decrease was primarily due to the deferral of 2018 corporate allocated severance costs due to the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress partial settlements in the 2019 North Carolina retail rate case and obligations to the Duke Energy Foundation in 2019, partially offset by higher loss experience related to captive insurance claims and higher franchise tax expense.\nOther Income and Expenses, net. The variance was primarily due to lower returns on investments that fund certain employee benefit obligations and lower earnings on the NMC investment primarily due to lower pricing.\nInterest Expense. The variance was primarily due to lower outstanding short-term debt and lower interest rates.\nIncome Tax Benefit. The decrease in the tax benefit was primarily driven by a decrease in pretax losses, partially offset by an increase in state income tax benefits. The ETRs for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, were 33.8% and 29.6%, respectively. The increase in the ETR was primarily due to an increase in state income tax benefits in 2020, in relation to pretax losses.\nPreferred Dividends. The variance was driven by the declaration of preferred stock dividends on preferred stock issued in late 2019.\nSUBSIDIARY REGISTRANTS\nBasis of Presentation\nThe results of operations and variance discussion for the Subsidiary Registrants is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instruction (I)(2)(a) of Form 10-K.\nDUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS\nResults of Operations\nThe following table shows the percent changes in GWh sales and average number of customers for Duke Energy Carolinas.

Judgments made include the likelihood of success of particular projects, possible legal and regulatory challenges, earnings assumptions on pension and other benefit fund investments and anticipated recovery of costs, especially through regulated operations.\nManagement discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with senior members of management on a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the Audit Committee. Management believes the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods.\nFor further information, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"\nRegulated Operations Accounting\nSubstantially all of Duke Energy\u2019s regulated operations meet the criteria for application of regulated operations accounting treatment. As a result, Duke Energy is required to record assets and liabilities that would not be recorded for nonregulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a regulator will require Duke Energy to make refunds to customers or reduce rates to customers for previous collections or deferred revenue for costs that have yet to be incurred.\nManagement continually assesses whether recorded regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as:\n\u2022applicable regulatory environment changes;\n\u2022historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in Duke Energy\u2019s jurisdictions;\n\u2022litigation of rate orders;\n\u2022recent rate orders to other regulated entities;\n\u2022levels of actual return on equity compared to approved rates of return on equity; and\n\u2022the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.\nIf future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, asset write-offs would be recognized in operating income. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, recognition of asset retirement costs and amortization of regulatory assets, or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets.\nAs required by regulated operations accounting rules, significant judgment can be required to determine if an otherwise recognizable incurred cost qualifies to be deferred for future recovery as a regulatory asset. Significant judgment can also be required to determine if revenues previously recognized are for entity specific costs that are no longer expected to be incurred or have not yet been incurred and are therefore a regulatory liability.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessments\nDuke Energy performed its annual goodwill impairment tests for all reporting units as of August 31, 2020. Additionally, Duke Energy monitors all relevant events and circumstances during the year to determine if an interim impairment test is required. Such events and circumstances include an adverse regulatory outcome, declining financial performance and deterioration of industry or market conditions. As of August 31, 2020, all of the reporting units' estimated fair value of equity substantially exceeded the carrying value of equity. The fair values of the reporting units were calculated using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries.\nEstimated future cash flows under the income approach are based on Duke Energy\u2019s internal business plan. Significant assumptions used are growth rates, future rates of return expected to result from ongoing rate regulation and discount rates. Management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the WACC for each individual reporting unit. The WACC takes into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. A major component of the cost of equity is the current risk-free rate on 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds. In the 2020 impairment tests, Duke Energy considered implied WACCs for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate WACC rates to use in its analysis. As each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations, including factors such as regulation, the WACC for each reporting unit may differ. Accordingly, the WACCs were adjusted, as appropriate, to account for company specific risk premiums. The discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of August 31, 2020, for each of Duke Energy\u2019s reporting units ranged from 5.2% to 5.7%. The underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes, particularly changes in the discount rates, authorized regulated rates of return or growth rates inherent in management\u2019s estimates of future cash flows, could result in future impairment charges.\nOne of the most significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units under the market approach is implied market multiples for certain peer companies. Management selects comparable peers based on each peer\u2019s primary business mix, operations, and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market values as of August 31.\nDuke Energy primarily operates in environments that are rate-regulated. In such environments, revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs, sales volumes and costs of capital. Accordingly, Duke Energy\u2019s regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects, positive or negative, of significant swings in market or economic conditions. However, significant changes in discount rates over a prolonged period may have a material impact on the fair value of equity.\nFor further information, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\"\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAROs are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment at the present value of the projected liability in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.\nThe present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding timing of future cash flows, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among other factors. These estimates are subject to change.\nObligations for nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress assume prompt dismantlement of the nuclear facilities after operations are ceased. During 2020, Duke Energy Florida, closed an agreement for the accelerated decommissioning of the Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station after receiving approval from the NRC and FPSC. The retirement obligations for the decommissioning of Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station are measured based on accelerated decommissioning from 2020 continuing through 2027. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also assume that spent fuel will be stored on-site until such time that it can be transferred to a yet to be built DOE facility.\nObligations for closure of ash basins are based upon discounted cash flows of estimated costs for site-specific plans. During 2020, the Hoosier Environmental Council filed a Petition for Administrative Review with the Indiana Office of Environmental Adjudication challenging the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's partial approval of Duke Energy Indiana's ash pond closure plan. Due to these challenges, in 2020, Duke Energy Indiana remeasured and increased the closure estimates for certain coal ash impoundments.\nFor further information, see Notes 3, 4 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Commitments and Contingencies\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations.\"\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment Assessments, Excluding Regulated Operations, and Equity Method Investments\nDuke Energy evaluates property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant change in cash flow projections or the determination that it is more likely than not that an asset or asset group will be sold) indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with their carrying value.\nPerforming an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets and developing the undiscounted future cash flows. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. Additionally, determining fair value requires probability weighting future cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results.\nWhen determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has discrete cash flows. Investments in affiliates that are not controlled by Duke Energy, but over which it has significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method. Equity method investments are assessed for impairment when conditions exist that indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than book value. It the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value, which establishes a new cost basis in the investment.\nDuring 2020, Duke Energy evaluated recoverability of certain renewable merchant plants due to declining market pricing and declining long-term forecasted energy prices, primarily driven by lower forecasted natural gas prices, capital cost of new renewables and increase renewable penetration. It was determined the assets were all recoverable as the carrying value of the assets approximated or exceeded the aggregate estimated future cash flows.\nFor further information, see Notes 2, 10 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Business Segments,\" \"Property, Plant and Equipment\" and \"Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates.\"\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits\nThe calculation of pension expense, other post-retirement benefit expense and net pension and other post-retirement assets or liabilities require the use of assumptions and election of permissible accounting alternatives. Changes in assumptions can result in different expense and reported asset or liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Duke Energy believes the most critical assumptions for pension and other post-retirement benefits are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate applied to future projected benefit payments.\nDuke Energy elects to amortize net actuarial gain or loss amounts that are in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation, into net pension or other post-retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of active participants expected to benefit under the plan. If all or almost all of a plan's participants are inactive, the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants is used instead of average remaining service period. Prior service cost or credit, which represents an increase or decrease in a plan's pension benefit obligation resulting from plan amendment, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the average expected remaining service period of active participants expected to benefit under the plan. If all or almost all of a plan's participants are inactive, the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants is used instead of average remaining service period.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Duke Energy assumes pension and other post-retirement plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 6.50%. The expected long-term rate of return was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers, where applicable. The asset allocation targets were set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile. Equity securities are held for their higher expected returns. Debt securities are primarily held to hedge the qualified pension liability. Real assets, return-seeking fixed income, hedge funds and other global securities are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers on investments.\nDuke Energy discounted its future U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a rate of 2.60% as of December 31, 2020. Discount rates used to measure benefit plan obligations for financial reporting purposes reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. As of December 31, 2020, Duke Energy determined its discount rate for U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan\u2019s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.\nFuture changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in Duke Energy\u2019s pension and post-retirement plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities. Duke Energy cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future. The following table presents the approximate effect on Duke Energy\u2019s 2020 pretax pension expense, pretax other post-retirement expense, pension obligation and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 0.25% change in rates were to occur.\nDuke Energy\u2019s other post-retirement plan uses a health care cost trend rate covering both pre- and post-age 65 retired plan participants, which is comprised of a medical care cost trend rate, which reflects the near- and long-term expectation of increases in medical costs, and a prescription drug cost trend rate, which reflects the near- and long-term expectation of increases in prescription drug costs. As of December 31, 2020, the health care cost trend rate was 6.25%, trending down to 4.75% by 2028. These plans are closed to new employees.\nFor further information, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cEmployee Benefit Plans.\u201d\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSources and Uses of Cash\nDuke Energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations, debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and capital requirements. Duke Energy\u2019s capital requirements arise primarily from capital and investment expenditures, repaying long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders.\nAmong other provisions, the Tax Act lowered the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and eliminated bonus depreciation for regulated utilities. For Duke Energy\u2019s regulated operations, the reduction in federal income taxes will result in lower regulated customer rates. However, due to its existing NOL position and other tax credits, Duke Energy does not expect to be a significant federal cash taxpayer through at least 2029. As a result, any reduction in customer rates could cause a material reduction in consolidated cash flows from operations in the short term. Over time, the reduction in deferred tax liabilities resulting from the Tax Act will increase Duke Energy\u2019s regulated rate base investments and customer rates. Impacts of the Tax Act to Duke Energy\u2019s cash flows and credit metrics are subject to the regulatory actions of its state commissions and the FERC. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cRegulatory Matters,\u201d for additional information.\nThe Subsidiary Registrants generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, support their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its other subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. The companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating under this arrangement. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cDebt and Credit Facilities,\u201d for additional discussion of the money pool arrangement.\nDuke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may also use short-term debt, including commercial paper and the money pool, as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows from operations. From time to time, Duke Energy\u2019s current liabilities exceed current assets resulting from the use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate due to the seasonality of its businesses.\nDuring March 2020, in response to market volatility and the ongoing economic uncertainty related to COVID-19, Duke Energy took several actions to enhance the company's liquidity position including:\n\u2022Duke Energy drew down the remaining $500 million of availability under the existing $1 billion Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility. That additional borrowing was subsequently repaid during the second quarter of 2020; and\n\u2022Duke Energy entered into and borrowed the full amount under a $1.5 billion, 364-day Term Loan Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Credit Agreement contained a provision for additional borrowing capacity of $500 million. Duke Energy exercised the provision and borrowed an additional $188 million, for a total borrowing of approximately $1.7 billion. By November 2020, Duke Energy repaid the entire borrowing under the 364-day Term Loan.\nFollowing March 2020, access to credit and equity markets has normalized. In addition to the March 2020 financings to address the company's liquidity position, for the year ended December 31, 2020, Duke Energy issued approximately $5.6 billion in debt and raised approximately $2.9 billion of common equity through equity forward agreements and the company's dividend reinvestment and ATM programs. A portion of the proceeds from the equity forward settlements will be used to fully repay Duke Energy's portion of the ACP construction loan of approximately $860 million. Despite the recovery in capital markets, Duke Energy continues to monitor access to credit and equity markets amid the ongoing economic uncertainty related to COVID-19.\nIn addition to actions taken by the company, the CARES Act, enacted in March 2020, as an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, included provisions providing relief to entities with remaining AMT credit refund allowances. Through the CARES Act, Duke Energy accelerated remaining AMT credit refund allowances and claimed a refund in full for any AMT credit carryforwards. As a result, in the third quarter of 2020, Duke Energy received $572 million related to AMT credit carryforwards and $19 million of interest income. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Income Taxes,\" for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Duke Energy had approximately $259 million of cash on hand, $5.6 billion available under its $8 billion Master Credit Facility and $500 million available under the $1 billion Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility. Duke Energy expects to have sufficient liquidity in the form of cash on hand, cash from operations and available credit capacity to support its funding needs. Refer to Notes 6 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities\" and \"Stockholders' Equity,\" respectively, for information regarding Duke Energy's debt and equity issuances, debt maturities and available credit facilities including the Master Credit Facility.\nCredit Facilities and Registration Statements\nSee Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities,\" for further information regarding credit facilities and shelf registration statements available to Duke Energy and the Duke Energy Registrants.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nDuke Energy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest business sectors. Duke Energy\u2019s projected capital and investment expenditures, including AFUDC debt and capitalized interest, for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below.\nDEBT MATURITIES\nSee Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities,\" for further information regarding significant components of Current Maturities of Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDIVIDEND PAYMENTS\nIn 2020, Duke Energy paid quarterly cash dividends for the 94th consecutive year and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future. There is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.\nDuke Energy targets a dividend payout ratio of between 65% and 75%, based upon adjusted EPS, and expects this trend to continue through 2025. Duke Energy increased the dividend by approximately 2% annually in both 2020 and 2019, and the company remains committed to continued growth of the dividend.\nDividend and Other Funding Restrictions of Duke Energy Subsidiaries\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cRegulatory Matters,\u201d Duke Energy\u2019s wholly owned public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy through dividends, advances or loans as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with merger transactions. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation, which in certain circumstances, limit their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on common stock. Additionally, certain other Duke Energy subsidiaries have other restrictions, such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy. At December 31, 2020, the amount of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of Duke Energy that may not be distributed to Duke Energy in the form of a loan or dividend does not exceed a material amount of Duke Energy\u2019s net assets. Duke Energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated equity accounts. Although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to Duke Energy, management does not believe these restrictions will have a significant impact on Duke Energy\u2019s ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations.\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nCash flows from operations of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure are primarily driven by sales of electricity and natural gas, respectively, and costs of operations. These cash flows from operations are relatively stable and comprise a substantial portion of Duke Energy\u2019s operating cash flows. Weather conditions, working capital and commodity price fluctuations and unanticipated expenses including unplanned plant outages, storms, legal costs and related settlements can affect the timing and level of cash flows from operations.\nAs part of Duke Energy\u2019s continued effort to improve its cash flows from operations and liquidity, Duke Energy works with vendors to improve terms and conditions, including the extension of payment terms. To support this effort, Duke Energy established a supply chain finance program (the \u201cprogram\u201d) in 2020, under which suppliers, at their sole discretion, may sell their receivables from Duke Energy to the participating financial institution. The financial institution administers the program. Duke Energy does not issue any guarantees with respect to the program and does not participate in negotiations between suppliers and the financial institution. Duke Energy does not have an economic interest in the supplier\u2019s decision to participate in the program and receives no interest, fees or other benefit from the financial institution based on supplier participation in the program. Suppliers\u2019 decisions on which invoices are sold do not impact Duke Energy\u2019s payment terms, which are based on commercial terms negotiated between Duke Energy and the supplier regardless of program participation. A significant deterioration in the credit quality of Duke Energy, economic downturn or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institutions willingness to participate in the program. Duke Energy does not believe such risk would have a material impact on our cash flows from operations or liquidity, as substantially all our payments are made outside the program.\nDuke Energy believes it has sufficient liquidity resources through the commercial paper markets, and ultimately, the Master Credit Facility, to support these operations. Cash flows from operations are subject to a number of other factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory constraints, economic trends and market volatility (see Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d for additional information).\nDEBT ISSUANCES\nDepending on availability based on the issuing entity, the credit rating of the issuing entity, and market conditions, the Subsidiary Registrants prefer to issue first mortgage bonds and secured debt, followed by unsecured debt. This preference is the result of generally higher credit ratings for first mortgage bonds and secured debt, which typically result in lower interest costs. Duke Energy Corporation primarily issues unsecured debt.\nIn 2021, Duke Energy anticipates issuing additional securities of $8 billion through debt capital markets. Additionally, Duke Energy may utilize other instruments, including equity-content securities, such as preferred stock. Proceeds will primarily be for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and debt maturities. See to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities,\" for further information regarding significant debt issuances in 2020.\nDuke Energy\u2019s capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the table below.\nRestrictive Debt Covenants\nDuke Energy\u2019s debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Duke Energy's Master Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 65% for each borrower, excluding Piedmont, and 70% for Piedmont. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements or sublimits thereto. As of December 31, 2020, each of the Duke Energy Registrants was in compliance with all covenants related to their debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses.\nCredit Ratings\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. and S&P provide credit ratings for various Duke Energy Registrants. During January 2021, S&P downgraded the issuer credit rating for Duke Energy (Parent) and all of its subsidiaries senior unsecured debt, excluding Progress Energy, from A- to BBB+. Additionally, S&P downgraded the credit rating for Duke Energy (Parent) and Progress Energy senior unsecured debt from BBB+ to BBB. As part of the credit rating report, S&P affirmed their credit rating on senior secured debt for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana, while also affirming the short-term and commercial paper credit ratings. These actions followed a December 2020, report by S&P to revise the credit rating outlook from stable to negative for Duke Energy and all its subsidiaries. As a result of the downgrade, credit rating outlooks returned to stable. Additionally, during October 2020, Moody's revised their credit rating outlook for Duke Energy (Parent), Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress from stable to negative and in February 2021, revised the credit rating outlook for these same registrants to review for downgrade. The following table includes Duke Energy and certain subsidiaries\u2019 credit ratings and ratings outlook as of February 2021.\nCredit ratings are intended to provide credit lenders a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold. The Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 credit ratings are dependent on the rating agencies\u2019 assessments of their ability to meet their debt principal and interest obligations when they come due. If, as a result of market conditions or other factors, the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain current balance sheet strength, or if earnings and cash flow outlook materially deteriorates, credit ratings could be negatively impacted.\nCash Flow Information\nThe following table summarizes Duke Energy\u2019s cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years.\nOPERATING CASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy\u2019s operating cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years.\nThe variance was driven primarily by:\n\u2022a $117 million increase in net income after adjustment for non-cash items primarily due to increases in current year non-cash adjustments, partially offset by decreases in revenues due to lower sales volumes, accelerated refund of fuel costs at Duke Energy Florida in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and lower wholesale revenue driven by the CCR Settlement Agreement;\n\u2022a $395 million decrease in cash outflows from working capital primarily due to fluctuations in inventory levels, accounts payable levels and lower income taxes paid in the current year; and\n\u2022a $136 million decrease in payments for AROs.\nINVESTING CASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy\u2019s investing cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years.\nThe primary use of cash related to investing activities is capital, investment and acquisition expenditures, net of return of investment capital detailed by reportable business segment in the following table. The decrease relates primarily to decreases in capital expenditures due to lower overall investments in the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables segments.\nFINANCING CASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy\u2019s financing cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years.\nThe variance was driven primarily by:\n\u2022a $1,962 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock;\n\u2022a $1,791 million net decrease in proceeds from issuances of long-term debt primarily due to timing of issuances and redemptions of long-term debt; and\n\u2022a $417 million decrease in contributions from noncontrolling interests, primarily due to $415 million related to the sale of a noncontrolling interest in the Commercial Renewables segment in 2019.\nPartially offset by:\n\u2022a $2,361 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, primarily from the settlement of equity forwards.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include performance guarantees, standby letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications.\nMost of the guarantee arrangements entered into by Duke Energy enhance the credit standing of certain subsidiaries, non-consolidated entities or less than wholly owned entities, enabling them to conduct business. As such, these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not always included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility of Duke Energy, either on its own or on behalf of Spectra Capital through indemnification agreements entered into as part of the January 2, 2007, spin-off of Spectra Energy Corp, having to honor its contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries, investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events.\nDuke Energy performs ongoing assessments of its respective guarantee obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been incurred as a result of potential increased nonperformance risk by third parties for which Duke Energy has issued guarantees. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cGuarantees and Indemnifications,\u201d for further details of the guarantee arrangements. Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of Duke Energy\u2019s operations. Thus, if Duke Energy discontinued issuing these guarantees, there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nOther than the guarantee arrangements discussed above and off-balance sheet debt related to non-consolidated VIEs, Duke Energy does not have any material off-balance sheet financing entities or structures. For additional information, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Variable Interest Entities.\"\nContractual Obligations\nDuke Energy enters into contracts that require payment of cash at certain specified periods, based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices. The following table summarizes Duke Energy\u2019s contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2020.\n(a)See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cDebt and Credit Facilities.\u201d\n(b)Interest payments on variable rate debt instruments were calculated using December 31, 2020, interest rates and holding them constant for the life of the instruments.\n(c)See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cLeases.\u201d Amounts in the table above include the interest component of finance leases based on the interest rates stated in the lease agreements and exclude certain related executory costs. Amounts exclude contingent lease obligations.\n(d)Current liabilities, except for current maturities of long-term debt, and purchase obligations reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been excluded from the above table.\n(e)Includes firm capacity payments that provide Duke Energy with uninterrupted firm access to electricity transmission capacity and natural gas transportation contracts, as well as undesignated contracts and contracts that qualify as NPNS. For contracts where the price paid is based on an index, the amount is based on market prices at December 31, 2020, or the best projections of the index. For certain of these amounts, Duke Energy may settle on a net cash basis since Duke Energy has entered into payment netting arrangements with counterparties that permit Duke Energy to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties.\n(f)Amounts exclude obligations under the OVEC PPA. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Variable Interest Entities,\" for additional information.\n(g)Includes contracts for software, telephone, data and consulting or advisory services. Amount also includes contractual obligations for EPC costs for new generation plants, wind and solar facilities, plant refurbishments, maintenance and day-to-day contract work and commitments to buy certain products. Amount excludes certain open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand for which the timing of the purchase cannot be determined.\n(h)Related to future annual funding obligations to NDTF through nuclear power stations' relicensing dates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Asset Retirement Obligations.\"\n(i)Related to Commercial Renewables wind facilities.\n(j)Unrecognized tax benefits of $125 million are not reflected in this table as Duke Energy cannot predict when open income tax years will close with completed examinations. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Income Taxes.\"\n(k)The table above excludes reserves for litigation, environmental remediation, asbestos-related injuries and damages claims and self-insurance claims (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d) because Duke Energy is uncertain as to the timing and amount of cash payments that will be required. Additionally, the table above excludes annual insurance premiums that are necessary to operate the business, including nuclear insurance (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d), funding of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans (see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Employee Benefit Plans\"), AROs, including ash management expenditures (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Asset Retirement Obligations\") and regulatory liabilities (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d) because the amount and timing of the cash payments are uncertain. Also excluded are Deferred Income Taxes and ITCs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets since cash payments for income taxes are determined based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nRisk Management Policies\nThe Enterprise Risk Management policy framework at Duke Energy includes strategy, operational, project execution and financial or transaction related risks. Enterprise Risk Management includes market risk as part of the financial and transaction related risks in its framework.\nDuke Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. Duke Energy has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke Energy\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors receives periodic updates from the Chief Risk Officer and other members of management on market risk positions, corporate exposures and overall risk management activities. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits.\nThe following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. See Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d and \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information\u201d for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward-looking statements made herein.\nCommodity Price Risk\nDuke Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy-related assets. Duke Energy\u2019s exposure to these fluctuations is primarily limited by the cost-based regulation of its regulated operations as these operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through various cost-recovery clauses, including fuel clauses, formula-based contracts, or other cost-sharing mechanisms. While there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when they are recovered through rates, changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results of these regulated operations. Within Duke Energy\u2019s Commercial Renewables segment, the company has limited exposure to market price fluctuations in prices of energy-related products as a result of its ownership of renewable assets.\nPrice risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energy\u2019s exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including contract size, length, market liquidity, market conditions, location and unique or specific contract terms. Duke Energy employs established policies and procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations, which may include using various commodity derivatives, such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. For additional information, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cDerivatives and Hedging.\u201d\nHedging Strategies\nDuke Energy closely monitors risks associated with commodity price changes on its future operations and, where appropriate, uses various commodity instruments such as electricity, coal and natural gas forward contracts and options to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations. Duke Energy\u2019s primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge against exposure to the prices of power, fuel for generation and natural gas for customers. Additionally, Duke Energy\u2019s Commercial Renewables business may enter into short-term or long-term hedge agreements to manage price risk associated with project output.\nThe majority of instruments used to manage Duke Energy\u2019s commodity price exposure are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts. Mark-to-market changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Undesignated contracts entered into by nonregulated businesses are marked-to-market each period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in earnings.\nDuke Energy may also enter into other contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception. When a contract meets the criteria to qualify as NPNS, Duke Energy applies such exception. Income recognition and realization related to NPNS contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity. For contracts qualifying for the NPNS exception, no recognition of the contract\u2019s fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring.\nGeneration Portfolio Risks\nThe Duke Energy Registrants optimize the value of their generation portfolios, which include generation assets, fuel and emission allowances. Modeled forecasts of future generation output and fuel requirements are based on forward power and fuel markets. The component pieces of the portfolio are bought and sold based on models and forecasts of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategies of the business units.\nFor the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure segment, the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operations or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations. However, the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations is partially offset by mechanisms in these regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of net profits from these activities with retail customers.\nInterest Rate Risk\nDuke Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance or anticipated issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Duke Energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. Duke Energy also enters into financial derivative instruments, which may include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See Notes 1, 6, 14 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d \u201cDebt and Credit Facilities,\u201d \u201cDerivatives and Hedging,\u201d and \u201cFair Value Measurements.\u201d\nDuke Energy had $7.6 billion of unhedged long- and short-term floating interest rate exposure at December 31, 2020. The impact of a 100-basis point change in interest rates on pretax income is approximately $76 million at December 31, 2020. This amount was estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate securities outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges as of December 31, 2020.\nCertain Duke Energy Registrants have variable-rate debt and manage interest rate risk by entering into financial contracts including interest rate swaps. See Notes 6 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities\" and \"Derivatives and Hedging.\" Such financial arrangements generally are indexed based upon LIBOR, which is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) has been identified by regulators and industry participants as the preferred successor rate for U.S. dollar-based LIBOR at that time. Impacted financial arrangements extending beyond 2021 may require contractual amendment or termination and renegotiation to fully adapt to a post-LIBOR environment, and there may be uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative index methodologies. Alternative index provisions are being assessed and incorporated into new financial arrangements that extend beyond 2021. Additionally, the progress of the phaseout is being monitored, including proposed transition relief from the FASB.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk represents the loss that the Duke Energy Registrants would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. Where exposed to credit risk, the Duke Energy Registrants analyze the counterparty's financial condition prior to entering into an agreement and monitor exposure on an ongoing basis. The Duke Energy Registrants establish credit limits where appropriate in the context of contractual arrangements and monitor such limits.\nTo reduce credit exposure, the Duke Energy Registrants seek to include netting provisions with counterparties, which permit the offset of receivables and payables with such counterparties. The Duke Energy Registrants also frequently use master agreements with credit support annexes to further mitigate certain credit exposures. The master agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral agreements generally also provide that the failure to post collateral when required is sufficient cause to terminate transactions and liquidate all positions.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash, letters of credit, or surety bonds from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cDerivatives and Hedging,\u201d for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 principal counterparties for its electric and natural gas businesses are RTOs, distribution companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U.S. Exposure to these entities consists primarily of amounts due to Duke Energy Registrants for delivered electricity. Additionally, there may be potential risks associated with remarketing of energy and capacity in the event of default by wholesale power customers. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of receivables from certain of such entities that may affect the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 credit risk.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to credit risk from transactions with their suppliers that involve prepayments or milestone payments in conjunction with outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and certain commodity purchases. The Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 credit exposure to such suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of nonperformance. The Duke Energy Registrants' frequently require guarantees or letters of credit from suppliers to mitigate this credit risk.\nCredit risk associated with the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 service to residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable. The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring tariff customers to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit or surety bond until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction at which time the deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the Duke Energy Registrants and are typically recovered through retail rates. Management continually monitors customer charge-offs, payment patterns and the impact of current economic conditions on customers' ability to pay their outstanding balance to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the Duke Energy Registrants announced a suspension of disconnections for nonpayment to be effective throughout the national emergency. While disconnections have resumed, the company continues to offer flexible options to customers struggling with the pandemic and the economic fallout, including extended payment arrangements to satisfy delinquent balances. In addition, the Duke Energy Registrants are monitoring the effects of the resultant economic slowdown on counterparties\u2019 abilities to perform under their contractual obligations. The Duke Energy Registrants have observed a significant increase in utility account arrears, which were roughly double historical levels as of December 31, 2020. There is an expectation of an increase in charge-offs in the future. See Notes 1, 3 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Revenue,\" respectively, for more information. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through CRC, a Duke Energy consolidated VIE. Losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of CRC and next by the subordinated retained interests held by Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cVariable Interest Entities.\u201d\nThe Duke Energy Registrants provide certain non-tariff services, primarily to large commercial and industrial customers in which incurred costs, including invested capital, are intended to be recovered from the individual customer and therefore are not subject to rate recovery in the event of customer default. Customer creditworthiness is assessed prior to entering into these transactions. Credit concentration related to these transactions exists for certain of these customers.\nDuke Energy\u2019s Commercial Renewables segment enters into long-term agreements with certain creditworthy buyers that may not include the right to call for collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade. Credit concentration exists to certain counterparties on these agreements, including entities that could be subject to wildfire liability. Additionally, Commercial Renewables may invest in projects for which buyers are below investment grade, although such buyers are required to post negotiated amounts of credit support. Also, power sales agreements and/or hedges of project output are generally for an initial term that does not cover the entire life of the asset. As a result, Commercial Renewables is exposed to market price risk and credit risk related to these agreements.\nDuke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for information on asbestos-related injuries and damages claims.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance and financial guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued these guarantees, it is possible that they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale, they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cGuarantees and Indemnifications,\u201d for further information on guarantees issued by the Duke Energy Registrants.\nBased on the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 policies for managing credit risk, their exposures and their credit and other reserves, the Duke Energy Registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of nonperformance by any counterparty.\nMarketable Securities Price Risk\nAs described further in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities,\u201d Duke Energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations. The vast majority of investments in equity securities are within the NDTF and assets of the various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.\nPension Plan Assets\nDuke Energy maintains investments to facilitate funding the costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. The equity securities held in these pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment, sector or geographic region. Duke Energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings, which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cEmployee Benefit Plans,\u201d for additional information regarding investment strategy of pension plan assets.\nA significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require Duke Energy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods. Additionally, a decline in the fair value of plan assets, absent additional cash contributions to the plan, could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods, which could adversely affect Duke Energy\u2019s results of operations in those periods.\nNuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds\nAs required by the NRC, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC, subsidiaries of Duke Energy maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. As of December 31, 2020, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities, debt securities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Per the NRC, Internal Revenue Code, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC requirements, these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. Duke Energy actively monitors its portfolios by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically reviewing, target allocation percentages for various asset classes.\nAccounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through retail and wholesale rates; therefore, fluctuations in investment prices do not materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as changes in the fair value of these investments are primarily deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to Orders by the NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC. Earnings or losses of the funds will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through retail and wholesale rates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cAsset Retirement Obligations,\u201d for additional information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities,\u201d for additional information regarding NDTF assets.\nOTHER MATTERS\nEnvironmental Regulations\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, coal ash and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time and result in new obligations of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nOn May 14, 2020, the five-year probation period following the Dan River coal ash spill ended. The court-appointed monitor confirmed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina that Duke Energy met or exceeded every obligation throughout the process. Separately, in a final report to the EPA, it was noted that the company made significant enhancements to its Ethics and Compliance Program and its environmental compliance programs.\nThe following sections outline various proposed and recently enacted legislation and regulations that may impact the Duke Energy Registrants. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for further information regarding potential plant retirements and regulatory filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants.\nCoal Combustion Residuals\nIn April 2015, EPA published a rule to regulate the disposal of CCR from electric utilities as solid waste. The federal regulation classifies CCR as nonhazardous waste and allows for beneficial use of CCR with some restrictions. The regulation applies to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface impoundments receiving CCR and existing surface impoundments located at stations generating electricity (regardless of fuel source), which were no longer receiving CCR but contained liquids as of the effective date of the rule. The rule establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR.\nOn July 17, 2018, EPA issued a final rule (Phase 1, Part 1) revising certain closure deadlines and groundwater protection standards in the CCR rule. The rule does not change the primary requirements for groundwater monitoring, corrective action, inspections and maintenance, and closure, and thus does not materially affect Duke Energy\u2019s coal ash basin closure plans or compliance obligations under the CCR rule. On October 22, 2018, a coalition of environmental groups filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit Court) challenging EPA's final Phase 1, Part 1 revisions to the CCR rule. On March 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court issued an order in the Phase 1, Part 1 litigation granting EPA\u2019s motion to remand the rule without vacatur. To date, EPA has finalized two notice-and-comment rulemakings to implement the court\u2019s decision on remand. The \u201cPart A\u201d rule, which was promulgated on August 28, 2020, establishes an April 11, 2021 deadline to cease placement of CCR and non-CCR waste streams into unlined ash basins and initiate closure, and the \u201cPart B\u201d rule, which was promulgated on November 12, 2020, establishes procedures to allow facilities to request approval to operate an existing CCR surface impoundment with an alternate liner. A future rulemaking is expected to address legacy impoundments. Duke Energy does not expect these rulemakings to have a material impact in light of its progress in closing CCR units across the enterprise.\nIn addition to the requirements of the federal CCR rule, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by the states. Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions and via wholesale contracts, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy\u2019s regulated operations. For more information, see Notes 3 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" respectively.\nCoal Ash Management Act of 2014\nAROs recorded on the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of the Coal Ash Act, the EPA CCR rule and other agreements. The Coal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for compliance deadlines and other issues surrounding the management of CCR and CCR surface impoundments and prohibits cost recovery in customer rates for unlawful discharge of ash impoundment waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The Coal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of ash impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions.\nConsistent with the requirements of the Coal Ash Act, Duke Energy previously submitted comprehensive site assessments and groundwater corrective plans to NCDEQ. In addition, on December 31, 2019, Duke Energy submitted updated groundwater corrective action plans and site-specific coal ash impoundment closure plans to NCDEQ.\nOn April 1, 2019, NCDEQ issued a closure determination requiring Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to excavate all remaining coal ash impoundments at the Allen, Belews Creek, Rogers, Marshall, Mayo and Roxboro facilities in North Carolina. On April 26, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed Petitions for Contested Case Hearings in the Office of Administrative Hearings to challenge NCDEQ's April 1 Order. On December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into a settlement agreement with NCDEQ and certain community groups under which Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress agreed to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins at these sites with ash moved to on-site lined landfills, including two at Allen, one at Belews Creek, one at Mayo, one at Roxboro, and two at Rogers. At the two remaining basins at Marshall and Roxboro, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. Those portions of the basins at Marshall and Roxboro, which were previously filled with ash and on which permitted facilities were constructed, will not be disturbed and will be closed pursuant to other state regulations.\nFollowing NCDEQ's April 1 Order, Duke Energy estimated the incremental undiscounted cost to close the nine remaining impoundments by excavation would be approximately $4 billion to $5 billion, potentially increasing the total estimated costs to permanently close all ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina to $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion. The settlement lowers the estimated total undiscounted cost to close the nine remaining basins by excavation by approximately $1.5 billion as compared to Duke Energy\u2019s original estimate that followed the order. As a result, the estimated total cost to permanently close all ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina is approximately $8 billion to $9 billion of which approximately $2.8 billion has been spent through 2020. The majority of the remaining spend is expected to occur over the next 15 to 20 years.\nDuke Energy has completed excavation of all coal ash at the Riverbend, Dan River and Sutton plants\nFor further information on ash basins and recovery, see Notes 3 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \u201cAsset Retirement Obligations,\u201d respectively.\nOther Environmental Regulations\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to various federal, state and local laws regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters, including the following:\n\u2022CWA\n\u2022Steam Effluent Limitation Guidelines\n\u2022Cross-State Air Pollution Rule\nDuke Energy continues to comply with enacted environmental statutes and regulations even as certain of these regulations are in various stages of clarification, revision or legal challenge. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters.\nSection 126 Petitions\nOn November 16, 2016, the state of Maryland filed a petition with EPA under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act alleging that 19 power plants, including two plants (three units) that Duke Energy Registrants own and operate, contribute to violations of EPA\u2019s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone in the state of Maryland. On March 12, 2018, the state of New York filed a petition with EPA, also under Section 126 of the Clean Air Act, alleging that over 60 power plants, including five that Duke Energy Registrants own and operate, contribute to violations of EPA\u2019s ozone NAAQS in the state of New York. Both Maryland and New York sought EPA orders requiring the states in which the named power plants operate impose more stringent nitrogen oxide emission limitations on the plants. On October 5, 2018, EPA denied the Maryland petition. That same day, Maryland appealed EPA's denial. On October 18, 2019, EPA denied the New York petition, and New York appealed that decision on October 29, 2019. On May 19, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued its decision, finding, with one exception, that EPA reasonably denied the Maryland petition. The court remanded one issue to EPA regarding target sources lacking catalytic controls. All of the Duke Energy units targeted have selective catalytic reduction, so the decision is favorable for these units.\nA different panel of the same court heard oral argument in New York\u2019s appeal of EPA\u2019s denial of its Section 126 Petition on May 7, 2020, and on July 14, 2020, the panel issued its decision remanding the Petition to EPA for further review. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nNorth Carolina Clean Energy Plan (NCCEP)\nOn October 29, 2018, Governor Roy Cooper signed an executive order calling for a 40% reduction in statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. The order tasked the NCDEQ with developing a clean energy plan for North Carolina. In October 2019, the NCDEQ published its plan, which includes the reduction of electric power sector greenhouse gas emissions by 70% below 2005 levels by 2030 and attainment of carbon neutrality by 2050, fostering long-term energy affordability and price stability for North Carolina\u2019s residents and businesses by modernizing regulatory and planning processes, and acceleration of clean energy innovation to create economic opportunities for both rural and urban areas. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress are significant stakeholders in this process. The magnitude and timing of investment in response to the NCCEP will depend on the speed of adoption and consensus developed by other stakeholders on how best to successfully transition to this clean energy future while establishing a regulatory model that incentivizes business decisions that benefit both the utilities and the public. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nGlobal Climate Change\nOn September 17, 2019, Duke Energy announced an updated climate strategy with new goals of at least 50% reduction in carbon emissions from electric generation by 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions from electric generation by 2050. On October 9, 2020, Duke Energy announced a new goal to achieve net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas distribution system by 2030. Timelines and initiatives, as well as implementation of new technologies, will vary in each state in which the company operates and will involve collaboration with regulators, customers and other stakeholders.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 GHG emissions consist primarily of CO2 and result primarily from operating a fleet of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants. Future levels of CO2 emissions will be influenced by variables that include economic conditions that affect electricity demand, fuel prices, market prices, compliance with new or existing regulations and the technologies deployed to generate the electricity necessary to meet customer demand.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants have taken actions that have resulted in a reduction of CO2 emissions over time. Actions have included the retirement of 51 coal-fired electric generating units with a combined generating capacity of 6,539 MW. Much of that capacity has been replaced with state-of-the-art highly efficient natural gas-fired generation that produces far fewer CO2 emissions per unit of electricity generated. Duke Energy also has made investments to expand its portfolio of wind and solar projects, increase EE offerings and ensure continued operations of its zero-CO2 emissions hydropower and nuclear plants. These efforts have diversified its system and significantly reduced CO2 emissions. Between 2005 and 2020, the Duke Energy Registrants have collectively lowered the CO2 emissions from their electricity generation by more than 40%, which potentially lowers the exposure to any future mandatory CO2 emission reduction requirements or carbon tax, whether as a result of federal legislation, EPA regulation, state regulation or other as yet unknown emission reduction requirement. Duke Energy will continue to explore the use of currently available and commercially demonstrated technology to reduce CO2 emissions, including EE, wind, solar, storage, carbon capture, utilization and sequestration, the use of hydrogen and other low-carbon fuels and advanced nuclear. Duke Energy will adjust to evolving and innovative technologies in a way that balances the reliability and affordability that meet regulatory requirements and customer demands. Under any future scenario involving mandatory CO2 limitations, the Duke Energy Registrants would plan to seek recovery of their compliance costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants recognize that scientists associate severe weather events with increasing levels of GHGs in the atmosphere and forecast the possibility these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater severity. However, the uncertain nature of potential changes in extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration and severity), the long period of time over which any potential changes might take place and the inability to predict potential changes with any degree of accuracy, make estimating with any certainty any potential future financial risk to the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 operations difficult.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants annually, biennially or triennially prepare lengthy, forward-looking IRPs. These detailed, highly technical plans are based on the company\u2019s thorough analysis of numerous factors that can impact the cost of producing and delivering electricity that influence long-term resource planning decisions. The IRP process helps to evaluate a range of options, taking into account stakeholder input as well as forecasts of future electricity demand, fuel prices, transmission improvements, new generating capacity, integration of renewables, energy storage, EE and demand response initiatives. The IRP process also helps evaluate potential environmental and regulatory scenarios to better mitigate policy and economic risks. The IRPs we file with regulators look out 10 to 20 years depending on the jurisdiction.\nFor a number of years, the Duke Energy Registrants have included a price on CO2 emissions in their IRP planning process to account for the potential regulation of CO2 emissions. Incorporating a price on CO2 emissions in the IRPs allows for the evaluation of existing and future resource needs against potential climate change policy risk in the absence of policy certainty. One of the challenges with using a CO2 price, especially in the absence of a clear and certain policy, is determining the appropriate price to use. To address this uncertainty and ensure the company remains agile, the Duke Energy Registrants typically use a range of potential CO2 prices to reflect a range of potential policy outcomes.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants routinely take steps to reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on their electric transmission and distribution systems and natural gas facilities. The steps include modernizing the electric grid through smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing and targeted undergrounding and applying lessons learned from previous storms to restoration efforts. The Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 electric generating facilities and natural gas facilities are designed to withstand extreme weather events without significant damage. The Duke Energy Registrants maintain inventories of coal, oil and liquified natural gas to mitigate the effects of any potential short-term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity and/or natural gas.\nState Legislation\nIn 2017, the North Carolina General Assembly passed House Bill 589, and it was subsequently signed into law by the governor. The law includes, among other things, overall reform of the application of PURPA for new solar projects in the state, a requirement for the utility to procure renewable energy through a competitive bidding process administered by an independent third party and recovery of costs related to the competitive bidding process through a competitive procurement rider. The process used was approved by the NCUC to select projects that would deliver the lowest cost of renewable energy for customers.\nIn accordance with the provisions of House Bill 589, Duke Energy estimates the total competitive procurement will be approximately 1,185 to 1,385 MW. Duke Energy will own or purchase at least 1,185 MW of energy from renewable energy projects under the North Carolina\u2019s CPRE program. Two tranches of the CPRE process have been completed with contracts executed for winning proposals. Five Duke Energy projects, totaling about 190 MW, were selected during the first tranche and none were selected during the second tranche. Two of the Duke Energy winning projects achieved commercial operation in December 2020 and the remaining three will be online by the third quarter 2021. The need for a third tranche of CPRE will be determined prior to November 2021.\nIn various states, legislation is being considered to allow third-party sales of electricity. Deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these initiatives.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d for a discussion of the impact of new accounting standards.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Matters - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 1, 3, and 9 to the financial statements.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to regulation by federal and state utility regulatory agencies (the \u201cCommissions\u201d), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of the Company\u2019s electric and natural gas distribution companies. Management has determined it meets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant judgment can be required to determine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has approximately $14 billion recorded as regulatory assets.\nThe Company\u2019s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. Rates charged to customers are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company\u2019s costs to provide utility service and a return on the Company\u2019s investment in the utility business. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. As discussed in Note 3, regulatory proceedings in recent years in North Carolina and South Carolina have focused on the recoverability of asset retirement obligations specific to coal ash.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

Management has determined it meets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant judgment can be required to determine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has approximately $3.5 billion recorded as regulatory assets.\nThe Company\u2019s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. Rates charged to customers are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company\u2019s costs to provide utility service and a return on the Company\u2019s investment in the utility business. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. As discussed in Note 3, regulatory proceedings in recent years in North Carolina and South Carolina have focused on the recoverability of asset retirement obligations specific to coal ash. As a result, assessing the potential outcomes of future regulatory orders in North Carolina and South Carolina requires significant management judgment.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management, including assumptions regarding the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions; to support its assertions on the likelihood of future recovery for deferred costs.

We evaluated the external information and compared it to management\u2019s recorded regulatory asset balances for completeness.\n\u2022For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company\u2019s and intervenors\u2019 filings with the Commission, including the settlement agreement filed with the Commission subsequent to December 31, 2020, that may impact the Company\u2019s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management\u2019s assertions.\n\u2022We evaluated the reasonableness of management\u2019s judgments regarding the recoverability of regulatory asset balances by performing the following:\n\u25e6We inquired of management regarding changes in regulatory orders and regulatory asset balances during the year.\n\u25e6We evaluated the reasonableness of such changes based on our knowledge of commission-approved amortization, expected incurred costs, and recently approved regulatory orders, as applicable.\n\u25e6We utilized trend analyses to evaluate the historical consistency of regulatory asset balances.\n\u25e6We compared the recorded regulatory asset balance to an independently developed expectation of the corresponding balance.\n\u2022We obtained representation from management asserting that regulatory assets recorded on the financial statements are probable of recovery.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nFebruary 25, 2021\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2001.\nDUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, LLC\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, LLC\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, LLC\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDUKE ENERGY FLORIDA, LLC\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\n(a) Amounts represent a cumulative-effect adjustment due to implementation of a new accounting standard related to Financial Instruments Classification and Measurement.

These legal obligations are the result of Indiana state and federal regulations. There is significant judgment in determining the assumptions used in estimating the closure costs for each site since Duke Energy Indiana does not have approved closure plans for certain sites. Potential changes to the projected closure costs for each site as well as probability weightings for the cash flows associated with the different potential closure methods (\u201cprobability weightings\u201d) creates estimation uncertainty. The liability for coal ash asset retirement obligations at Duke Energy Indiana was $1,140 million at December 31, 2020.\nWe identified the asset retirement obligations associated with coal ash impoundments at Duke Energy Indiana as a critical audit matter because of the significant management estimates and assumptions, including projected closure costs as well as the different potential closure methods. The audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates and assumptions related to potential changes to the projected closure costs for each site as well as probability weightings for the cash flows associated with the different potential closure methods required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our environmental specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the underlying estimated closure costs for coal ash asset retirement obligations at Duke Energy Indiana included the following, among others:\n\u2022We tested the effectiveness of controls over management\u2019s coal ash asset retirement obligation estimate, including those over management\u2019s determination of the estimated closure costs and probability weightings.\n\u2022We evaluated management\u2019s ability to accurately estimate future closure costs by comparing actual closure costs to management\u2019s historical estimates.\n\u2022We tested the mathematical accuracy of management\u2019s coal ash asset retirement obligation calculations, including the application of probability weightings.\n\u2022We made inquiries of internal and external legal counsel regarding the status of the legal matters associated with the probability weightings.\n\u2022We inspected the opinions from internal and external legal counsel supporting the probability weightings.\n\u2022We inspected the Company\u2019s filings with and orders from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, for evidence that might contradict management\u2019s assertions regarding the estimated closure costs and probability weightings.\n\u2022With the assistance of our environmental specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimated closure costs by comparing the costs to actual costs incurred at comparable coal ash impoundments, underlying contracts, and publicly available industry cost data, as applicable.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nFebruary 25, 2021\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.\nDUKE ENERGY INDIANA, LLC\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDUKE ENERGY INDIANA, LLC\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDUKE ENERGY INDIANA, LLC\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDUKE ENERGY INDIANA, LLC\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholder and the Board of Directors of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\").

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Operations and Basis of Consolidation\nDuke Energy is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, subject to regulation by the FERC and other regulatory agencies listed below. Duke Energy operates in the U.S. primarily through its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Certain Duke Energy subsidiaries are also subsidiary registrants, including Duke Energy Carolinas; Progress Energy; Duke Energy Progress; Duke Energy Florida; Duke Energy Ohio; Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. When discussing Duke Energy\u2019s consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of its separate Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.\nThe information in these combined notes relates to each of the Duke Energy Registrants as noted in the Index to Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. However, none of the Subsidiary Registrants make any representation as to information related solely to Duke Energy or the Subsidiary Registrants of Duke Energy other than itself.\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include, after eliminating intercompany transactions and balances, the accounts of the Duke Energy Registrants and subsidiaries or VIEs where the respective Duke Energy Registrants have control. See Note 17 for additional information on VIEs. These Consolidated Financial Statements also reflect the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 proportionate share of certain jointly owned generation and transmission facilities. See Note 8 for additional information on joint ownership. Substantially all of the Subsidiary Registrants' operations qualify for regulatory accounting.\nDuke Energy Carolinas is a regulated public utility primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. Duke Energy Carolinas is subject to the regulatory provisions of the NCUC, PSCSC, NRC and FERC.\nProgress Energy is a public utility holding company, which conducts operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida. Progress Energy is subject to regulation by FERC and other regulatory agencies listed below.\nDuke Energy Progress is a regulated public utility primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. Duke Energy Progress is subject to the regulatory provisions of the NCUC, PSCSC, NRC and FERC.\nDuke Energy Florida is a regulated public utility primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in portions of Florida. Duke Energy Florida is subject to the regulatory provisions of the FPSC, NRC and FERC.\nDuke Energy Ohio is a regulated public utility primarily engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in portions of Ohio and Kentucky, the generation and sale of electricity in portions of Kentucky and the transportation and sale of natural gas in portions of Ohio and Kentucky. Duke Energy Ohio conducts competitive auctions for retail electricity supply in Ohio whereby the energy price is recovered from retail customers and recorded in Operating Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Operations in Kentucky are conducted through its wholly owned subsidiary, Duke Energy Kentucky. References herein to Duke Energy Ohio collectively include Duke Energy Ohio and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise noted. Duke Energy Ohio is subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUCO, KPSC and FERC.\nDuke Energy Indiana is a regulated public utility primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in portions of Indiana. Duke Energy Indiana is subject to the regulatory provisions of the IURC and FERC.\nPiedmont is a regulated public utility primarily engaged in the distribution of natural gas in portions of North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. Piedmont is subject to the regulatory provisions of the NCUC, PSCSC, TPUC and FERC.\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on global health and economic environments. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and the federal government proclaimed that the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States constitutes a national emergency. The Duke Energy Registrants are monitoring developments closely and responding appropriately. The company incurred approximately $112 million of incremental COVID-19 costs before deferral for the year ended December 31, 2020, included in Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Further, the company waived approximately $64 million of late payment fees for the year ended December 31, 2020. The company has deferred approximately $76 million of the incremental costs, which were primarily bad debt expense, personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies, and a cost component of late payment fees. See Notes 3, 6, 17, 18 and 23 for additional information as well as steps taken to mitigate the impacts to our business and customers from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther Current Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table provides a description of amounts included in Other within Current Assets or Current Liabilities that exceed 5% of total Current Assets or Current Liabilities on the Duke Energy Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets at either December 31, 2020, or 2019.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDuke Energy has elected to present cash flows of discontinued operations combined with cash flows of continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, the notes to these consolidated financial statements exclude amounts related to discontinued operations for all periods presented. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations, net of tax on Duke Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations is entirely attributable to controlling interest.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nDuke Energy maintains a controlling financial interest in certain less than wholly owned nonregulated subsidiaries. As a result, Duke Energy consolidates these subsidiaries and presents the third-party investors' portion of Duke Energy's net income (loss), net assets and comprehensive income (loss) as noncontrolling interest. Noncontrolling interest is included as a component of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nSeveral operating agreements of Duke Energy's subsidiaries with noncontrolling interest are subject to allocations of tax attributes and cash flows in accordance with contractual agreements that vary throughout the lives of the subsidiaries. Therefore, Duke Energy and the other investors' (the owners) interests in the subsidiaries are not fixed, and the subsidiaries apply the HLBV method in allocating income or loss and other comprehensive income or loss (all measured on a pretax basis) to the owners. The HLBV method measures the amounts that each owner would hypothetically claim at each balance sheet reporting date, including tax benefits realized by the owners, most of which is over the IRS recapture period, upon a hypothetical liquidation of the subsidiary at the net book value of its underlying assets. The change in the amount that each owner would hypothetically receive at the reporting date compared to the amount it would have received on the previous reporting date represents the amount of income or loss allocated to each owner for the reporting period.\nOther operating agreements of Duke Energy's subsidiaries with noncontrolling interest allocate profit and loss based on their pro rata shares of the ownership interest in the respective subsidiary. Therefore, Duke Energy allocates net income or loss and other comprehensive income or loss of these subsidiaries to the owners based on their pro rata shares.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, Duke Energy completed a sale of minority interest in a portion of certain renewable assets within the Commercial Renewables Segment for pretax proceeds to Duke Energy of $415 million. The portion of Duke Energy's commercial renewables energy portfolio sold includes 49% of 37 operating wind, solar and battery storage assets and 33% of 11 operating solar assets across the U.S. Duke Energy retained control of these assets, and, therefore, no gain or loss was recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The difference between the consideration received and the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest claim on net assets is $466 million, net of tax benefit of $8 million, and was recorded to equity.\nThe following table presents cash received for the sale of noncontrolling interest and allocated losses to noncontrolling interest for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019.\n2021 Sale of Minority Interest in Duke Energy Indiana\nIn January 2021, Duke Energy entered into a definitive agreement providing for the sale of a 19.9% minority interest in Duke Energy Indiana with an affiliate of GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund and an experienced investor in U.S. infrastructure. To facilitate the transaction, Duke Energy will issue and sell membership interests in Duke Energy Indiana Holdco, LLC. a newly created holding company that will own 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Duke Energy Indiana. The transaction will be completed following two closings for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2 billion. The first closing is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021 and Duke Energy will issue and sell 11.1% of the membership interests in exchange for 50% of the purchase price. Under the terms of the agreement, Duke Energy has the discretion to determine the timing of the second closing, but it will occur no later than January 2023. At the second closing, Duke Energy will issue and sell additional membership interests such that GIC will own 19.9% of the membership interests for the remaining 50% of the purchase price. Duke Energy will continue to operate and retain control of Duke Energy Indiana and, therefore, no gain or loss is expected to be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, the transaction will be reflected within Duke Energy Corporations' stockholders' equity as a sale of a noncontrolling interest.\nAcquisitions\nThe Duke Energy Registrants consolidate assets and liabilities from acquisitions as of the purchase date and include earnings from acquisitions in consolidated earnings after the purchase date.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing financial statements that conform to GAAP, the Duke Energy Registrants must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRegulatory Accounting\nThe majority of the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 operations are subject to price regulation for the sale of electricity and natural gas by state utility commissions or FERC. When prices are set on the basis of specific costs of the regulated operations and an effective franchise is in place such that sufficient natural gas or electric services can be sold to recover those costs, the Duke Energy Registrants apply regulatory accounting. Regulatory accounting changes the timing of the recognition of costs or revenues relative to a company that does not apply regulatory accounting. As a result, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized consistent with the treatment of the related cost in the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets are reviewed for recoverability each reporting period. If a regulatory asset is no longer deemed probable of recovery, the deferred cost is charged to earnings. See Note 3 for further information.\nRegulatory accounting rules also require recognition of a disallowance (also called \"impairment\") loss if it becomes probable that part of the cost of a plant under construction (or a recently completed plant or an abandoned plant) will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. For example, if a cost cap is set for a plant still under construction, the amount of the disallowance is a result of a judgment as to the ultimate cost of the plant. These disallowances can require judgments on allowed future rate recovery.\nWhen it becomes probable that regulated generation, transmission or distribution assets will be abandoned, the cost of the asset is removed from plant in service. The value that may be retained as a regulatory asset on the balance sheet for the abandoned property is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return. As such, an impairment charge could be partially or fully offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset if rate recovery is probable. The impairment charge for a disallowance of costs for regulated plants under construction, recently completed or abandoned is based on discounted cash flows.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants utilize cost-tracking mechanisms, commonly referred to as fuel adjustment clauses or PGA clauses. These clauses allow for the recovery of fuel and fuel-related costs, portions of purchased power, natural gas costs and hedging costs through surcharges on customer rates. The difference between the costs incurred and the surcharge revenues is recorded either as an adjustment to Operating Revenues, Operating Expenses - Fuel used in electric generation or Operating Expenses - Cost of natural gas on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, with an off-setting impact on regulatory assets or liabilities.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. Duke Energy, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Florida have restricted cash balances related primarily to collateral assets, escrow deposits and VIEs. See Note 17 for additional information. Restricted cash amounts are included in Other within Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table presents the components of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInventory\nInventory related to regulated operations is valued at historical cost. Inventory related to nonregulated operations is valued at the lower of cost or market. Inventory is charged to expense or capitalized to property, plant and equipment when issued, primarily using the average cost method. Excess or obsolete inventory is written down to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Once inventory has been written down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written up. Provisions for inventory write-offs were not material at December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The components of inventory are presented in the tables below.\nInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities\nThe Duke Energy Registrants classify investments in equity securities as FV-NI and investments in debt securities as AFS. Both categories are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities classified as FV-NI are reported through net income. Unrealized gains and losses for debt securities classified as AFS are included in AOCI until realized, unless it is determined the carrying value of an investment has a credit loss. For certain investments of regulated operations, such as substantially all of the NDTF, realized and unrealized gains and losses (including any credit losses) on debt securities are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability. The credit loss portion of debt securities of nonregulated operations are included in earnings. Investments in debt and equity securities are classified as either current or noncurrent based on management\u2019s intent and ability to sell these securities, taking into consideration current market liquidity. See Note 15 for further information.\nGoodwill\nDuke Energy, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont perform annual goodwill impairment tests as of August 31 each year at the reporting unit level, which is determined to be a business segment or one level below. Duke Energy, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont update these tests between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. See Note 11 for further information.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are included in Other in Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, intangible assets are amortized using an amortization method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or on a straight-line basis if that pattern is not readily determinable. Amortization of intangibles is reflected in Depreciation and amortization on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Intangible assets are subject to impairment testing and if impaired, the carrying value is accordingly reduced.\nRECs are used to measure compliance with renewable energy standards and are held primarily for consumption. See Note 11 for further information.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairments\nThe Duke Energy Registrants evaluate long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when a long-lived asset\u2019s carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. The estimated cash flows may be based on alternative expected outcomes that are probability weighted. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable based on these estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value of the asset is written down to its then current estimated fair value and an impairment charge is recognized.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants assess fair value of long-lived assets using various methods, including recent comparable third-party sales, internally developed discounted cash flow analysis and analysis from outside advisors. Triggering events to reassess cash flows may include, but are not limited to, significant changes in commodity prices, the condition of an asset or management\u2019s interest in selling the asset.\nEquity Method Investment Impairments\nInvestments in affiliates that are not controlled by Duke Energy, but over which it has significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method. Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. If the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value, which establishes a new cost basis in the investment.\nImpairment assessments use a discounted cash flow income approach and include consideration of the severity and duration of any decline in the fair value of the investments. The estimated cash flows may be based on alternative expected outcomes that are probability weighted. Key inputs that involve estimates and significant management judgment include cash flow projections, selection of a discount rate, probability weighting of potential outcomes, and whether any decline in value is considered temporary.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at the lower of depreciated historical cost net of any disallowances or fair value, if impaired. The Duke Energy Registrants capitalize all construction-related direct labor and material costs, as well as indirect construction costs such as general engineering, taxes and financing costs. See \u201cAllowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalized\u201d for information on capitalized financing costs. Costs of renewals and betterments that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are also capitalized. The cost of repairs, replacements and major maintenance projects, which do not extend the useful life or increase the expected output of the asset, are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is generally computed over the estimated useful life of the asset using the composite straight-line method. Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update composite rates and are approved by state utility commissions and/or the FERC when required. The composite weighted average depreciation rates, excluding nuclear fuel, are included in the table that follows.\nIn general, when the Duke Energy Registrants retire regulated property, plant and equipment, the original cost plus the cost of retirement, less salvage value and any depreciation already recognized, is charged to accumulated depreciation. However, when it becomes probable the asset will be retired substantially in advance of its original expected useful life or is abandoned, the cost of the asset and the corresponding accumulated depreciation is recognized as a separate asset. If the asset is still in operation, the net amount is classified as Generation facilities to be retired, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the asset is no longer operating, the net amount is classified in Regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets if deemed recoverable (see discussion of long-lived asset impairments above). The carrying value of the asset is based on historical cost if the Duke Energy Registrants are allowed to recover the remaining net book value and a return equal to at least the incremental borrowing rate. If not, an impairment is recognized to the extent the net book value of the asset exceeds the present value of future revenues discounted at the incremental borrowing rate.\nWhen the Duke Energy Registrants sell entire regulated operating units, or retire or sell nonregulated properties, the original cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization balances are removed from Property, Plant and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any gain or loss is recorded in earnings, unless otherwise required by the applicable regulatory body. See Note 10 for additional information.\nLeases\nDuke Energy determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception based on whether the arrangement involves the use of a physically distinct identified asset and whether Duke Energy has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period as well as the right to direct the use of the asset. As a policy election, Duke Energy does not evaluate arrangements with initial contract terms of less than one year as leases.\nOperating leases are included in Operating lease ROU assets, net, Other current liabilities and Operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in Property, plant and equipment, Current maturities of long-term debt and Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor lessee and lessor arrangements, Duke Energy has elected a policy to not separate lease and non-lease components for all asset classes. For lessor arrangements, lease and non-lease components are only combined under one arrangement and accounted for under the lease accounting framework if the non-lease components are not the predominant component of the arrangement and the lease component would be classified as an operating lease.\nNuclear Fuel\nNuclear fuel is classified as Property, Plant and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNuclear fuel in the front-end fuel processing phase is considered work in progress and not amortized until placed in service. Amortization of nuclear fuel is included within Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amortization is recorded using the units-of-production method.\nAllowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalized\nFor regulated operations, the debt and equity costs of financing the construction of property, plant and equipment are reflected as AFUDC and capitalized as a component of the cost of property, plant and equipment. AFUDC equity is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as non-cash income in Other income and expenses, net. AFUDC debt is reported as a non-cash offset to Interest Expense. After construction is completed, the Duke Energy Registrants are permitted to recover these costs through their inclusion in rate base and the corresponding subsequent depreciation or amortization of those regulated assets.\nAFUDC equity, a permanent difference for income taxes, reduces the ETR when capitalized and increases the ETR when depreciated or amortized. See Note 23 for additional information.\nFor nonregulated operations, interest is capitalized during the construction phase with an offsetting non-cash credit to Interest Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAROs are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment. Substantially all AROs are related to regulated operations. When recording an ARO, the present value of the projected liability is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The liability is accreted over time. For operating plants, the present value of the liability is added to the cost of the associated asset and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset. For retired plants, the present value of the liability is recorded as a regulatory asset unless determined not to be probable of recovery.\nThe present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding timing of future cash flows, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among other factors. These estimates are subject to change. Depreciation expense is adjusted prospectively for any changes to the carrying amount of the associated asset. The Duke Energy Registrants receive amounts to fund the cost of the ARO for regulated operations through a combination of regulated revenues and earnings on the NDTF. As a result, amounts recovered in regulated revenues, earnings on the NDTF, accretion expense and depreciation of the associated asset are netted and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.\nAccounts Payable\nDuring 2020, Duke Energy established a supply chain finance program (the \u201cprogram\u201d) with a global financial institution. The program is voluntary and allows Duke Energy suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from Duke Energy to the financial institution at a rate that leverages Duke Energy\u2019s credit rating and, which may result in favorable terms compared to the rate available to the supplier on their own credit rating. Suppliers participating in the program, determine at their sole discretion which invoices they will sell to the financial institution. Suppliers\u2019 decisions on which invoices are sold do not impact Duke Energy\u2019s payment terms, which are based on commercial terms negotiated between Duke Energy and the supplier regardless of program participation. The commercial terms negotiated between Duke Energy and its suppliers are consistent regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the program. Duke Energy does not issue any guarantees with respect to the program and does not participate in negotiations between suppliers and the financial institution. Duke Energy does not have an economic interest in the supplier\u2019s decision to participate in the program and receives no interest, fees or other benefit from the financial institution based on supplier participation in the program.\nAt December 31, 2020, $15 million, $1 million and $14 million of the outstanding Accounts payable balance for Duke Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont, respectively, was sold to the financial institution by our suppliers. Suppliers invoices sold to the financial institution under the program totaled $45 million, $9 million and $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, for Duke Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont, respectively. All activity related to amounts due to suppliers who elected to participate in the program are included within Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nDuke Energy recognizes revenue as customers obtain control of promised goods and services in an amount that reflects consideration expected in exchange for those goods or services. Generally, the delivery of electricity and natural gas results in the transfer of control to customers at the time the commodity is delivered and the amount of revenue recognized is equal to the amount billed to each customer, including estimated volumes delivered when billings have not yet occurred. See Note 18 for further information.\nDerivatives and Hedging\nDerivative and non-derivative instruments may be used in connection with commodity price and interest rate activities, including swaps, futures, forwards and options. All derivative instruments, except those that qualify for the NPNS exception, are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Qualifying derivative instruments may be designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. Other derivative instruments (undesignated contracts) either have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recorded in AOCI. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of a fair value hedge is offset in net income by changes in the hedged item. For activity subject to regulatory accounting, gains and losses on derivative contracts are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities and not as other comprehensive income or current period income. As a result, changes in fair value of these derivatives have no immediate earnings impact.\nFormal documentation, including transaction type and risk management strategy, is maintained for all contracts accounted for as a hedge. At inception and at least every three months thereafter, the hedge contract is assessed to see if it is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items.\nSee Note 14 for further information.\nCaptive Insurance Reserves\nDuke Energy has captive insurance subsidiaries that provide coverage, on an indemnity basis, to the Subsidiary Registrants as well as certain third parties, on a limited basis, for financial losses, primarily related to property, workers\u2019 compensation and general liability. Liabilities include provisions for estimated losses incurred but not reported (IBNR), as well as estimated provisions for known claims. IBNR reserve estimates are primarily based upon historical loss experience, industry data and other actuarial assumptions. Reserve estimates are adjusted in future periods as actual losses differ from experience.\nDuke Energy, through its captive insurance entities, also has reinsurance coverage with third parties for certain losses above a per occurrence and/or aggregate retention. Receivables for reinsurance coverage are recognized when realization is deemed probable.\nUnamortized Debt Premium, Discount and Expense\nPremiums, discounts and expenses incurred with the issuance of outstanding long-term debt are amortized over the term of the debt issue. The gain or loss on extinguishment associated with refinancing higher-cost debt obligations in the regulated operations is amortized over the remaining life of the original instrument. Amortization expense is recorded as Interest Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and is reflected as Depreciation, amortization and accretion within Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nPremiums, discounts and expenses are presented as an adjustment to the carrying value of the debt amount and included in Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets presented.\nPreferred Stock\nPreferred stock is reviewed to determine the appropriate balance sheet classification and embedded features, such as call options, are evaluated to determine if they should be bifurcated and accounted for separately. Costs directly related to the issuance of preferred stock is recorded as a reduction of the proceeds received. The liability for the dividend is recognized when declared. The accumulated dividends on the cumulative preferred stock is recognized to net income available to Duke Energy Corporation in the EPS calculation. See Note 19 for further information.\nLoss Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities\nContingent losses are recorded when it is probable a loss has occurred and can be reasonably estimated. When a range of the probable loss exists and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range is recorded. Unless otherwise required by GAAP, legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nEnvironmental liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental remediation or other liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated. Environmental expenditures related to past operations that do not generate current or future revenues are expensed. Environmental expenditures related to operations that generate current or future revenues are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Certain environmental expenditures receive regulatory accounting treatment and are recorded as regulatory assets.\nSee Notes 3 and 4 for further information.\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nDuke Energy maintains qualified, non-qualified and other post-retirement benefit plans. Eligible employees of the Subsidiary Registrants participate in the respective qualified, non-qualified and other post-retirement benefit plans and the Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of benefit costs. See Note 22 for further information, including significant accounting policies associated with these plans.\nSeverance and Special Termination Benefits\nDuke Energy has severance plans under which in general, the longer a terminated employee worked prior to termination the greater the amount of severance benefits. A liability for involuntary severance is recorded once an involuntary severance plan is committed to by management if involuntary severances are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For involuntary severance benefits incremental to its ongoing severance plan benefits, the fair value of the obligation is expensed at the communication date if there are no future service requirements or over the required future service period. Duke Energy also offers special termination benefits under voluntary severance programs. Special termination benefits are recorded immediately upon employee acceptance absent a significant retention period. Otherwise, the cost is recorded over the remaining service period. Employee acceptance of voluntary severance benefits is determined by management based on the facts and circumstances of the benefits being offered. See Note 20 for further information.\nGuarantees\nIf necessary, liabilities are recognized at the time of issuance or material modification of a guarantee for the estimated fair value of the obligation it assumes. Fair value is estimated using a probability weighted approach. The obligation is reduced over the term of the guarantee or related contract in a systematic and rational method as risk is reduced. Duke Energy recognizes a liability for the best estimate of its loss due to the nonperformance of the guaranteed party. This liability is recognized at the inception of a guarantee and is updated periodically. See Note 7 for further information.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation represents costs related to stock-based awards granted to employees and Board of Directors members. Duke Energy recognizes stock-based compensation based upon the estimated fair value of awards, net of estimated forfeitures at the date of issuance. The recognition period for these costs begins at either the applicable service inception date or grant date and continues throughout the requisite service period. Compensation cost is recognized as expense or capitalized as a component of property, plant and equipment. See Note 21 for further information.\nIncome Taxes\nDuke Energy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and other state and foreign jurisdictional returns. The Subsidiary Registrants are parties to a tax-sharing agreement with Duke Energy. Income taxes recorded represent amounts the Subsidiary Registrants would incur as separate C-Corporations. Deferred income taxes have been provided for temporary differences between GAAP and tax bases of assets and liabilities because the differences create taxable or tax-deductible amounts for future periods. ITCs associated with regulated operations are deferred and amortized as a reduction of income tax expense over the estimated useful lives of the related properties. For ITCs associated with nonregulated operations see \u201cAccounting for Renewable Energy Tax Credits.\u201d\nAccumulated deferred income taxes are valued using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be settled or realized. In the event of a change in tax rates, deferred tax assets and liabilities are remeasured as of the enactment date of the new rate. To the extent that the change in the value of the deferred tax represents an obligation to customers, the impact of the remeasurement is deferred to a regulatory liability. Remaining impacts are recorded in income from continuing operations. Duke Energy's results of operations could be impacted if the estimate of the tax effect of reversing temporary differences is not reflective of actual outcomes, is modified to reflect new developments or interpretations of the tax law, revised to incorporate new accounting principles, or changes in the expected timing or manner of a reversal.\nTax-related interest and penalties are recorded in Interest Expense and Other Income and Expenses, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSee Note 23 for further information.\nAccounting for Renewable Energy Tax Credits\nWhen Duke Energy receives ITCs on wind or solar facilities associated with its nonregulated operations, it reduces the basis of the property recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets by the amount of the ITC and, therefore, the ITC benefit is ultimately recognized in the statement of operations through reduced depreciation expense. Additionally, certain tax credits and government grants result in an initial tax depreciable base in excess of the book carrying value by an amount equal to one half of the ITC. Deferred tax benefits are recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in the period that the basis difference is created.\nWhen Duke Energy receives ITCs on wind or solar facilities associated with its regulated operations, the ITC is deferred and amortized as a reduction of income tax expense over the estimated useful lives of the related properties.\nDuke Energy receives PTCs on wind facilities that are recognized as electricity is produced and records related amounts as a reduction of income tax expense.\nExcise Taxes\nCertain excise taxes levied by state or local governments are required to be paid even if not collected from the customer. These taxes are recognized on a gross basis. Taxes for which Duke Energy operates merely as a collection agent for the state and local government are accounted for on a net basis. Excise taxes accounted for on a gross basis within both Operating Revenues and Property and other taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were as follows.\nDividend Restrictions and Unappropriated Retained Earnings\nDuke Energy does not have any current legal, regulatory or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders. However, if Duke Energy were to defer dividend payments on the preferred stock, the declaration of common stock dividends would be prohibited. See Note 19 for more information. Additionally, as further described in Note 3, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont have restrictions on paying dividends or otherwise advancing funds to Duke Energy due to conditions established by regulators in conjunction with merger transaction approvals. At December 31, 2020, and 2019, an insignificant amount of Duke Energy\u2019s consolidated Retained earnings balance represents undistributed earnings of equity method investments.\nNew Accounting Standards\nThe following new accounting standard was adopted by Duke Energy Registrants in 2020.\nCredit Losses. In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for credit losses. Duke Energy adopted the new accounting guidance for credit losses effective January 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective method of adoption, which does not require restatement of prior year results. Duke Energy did not adopt any practical expedients.\nDuke Energy recognizes allowances for credit losses based on management's estimate of losses expected to be incurred over the lives of certain assets or guarantees. Management monitors credit quality, changes in expected credit losses and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a forward-looking basis. Management reviews the risk of loss periodically as part of the existing assessment of collectability of receivables.\nDuke Energy reviews the credit quality of its counterparties as part of its regular risk management process and requires credit enhancements, such as deposits or letters of credit, as appropriate and as allowed by regulators.\nDuke Energy recorded cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles related to the adoption of new credit loss standard, for allowances and credit losses of trade and other receivables, insurance receivables and financial guarantees. These amounts are included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in Receivables, Receivables of VIEs, Other Noncurrent Assets and Other Noncurrent Liabilities. See Notes 7 and 18 for more information.\nDuke Energy recorded an adjustment for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle due to the adoption of this standard on January 1, 2020, as shown in the table below:\nThe following new accounting standard has been issued but not yet adopted by the Duke Energy Registrants as of December 31, 2020.\nReference Rate Reform. In March 2020, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for reference rate reform. This guidance is elective and provides expedients to facilitate financial reporting for the anticipated transition away from the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank reference rates by the end of 2021. The optional expedients are effective for modification of existing contracts or new arrangements executed between March 12, 2020, through December 31, 2022.\nDuke Energy has variable-rate debt and manages interest rate risk by entering into financial contracts including interest rate swaps that are generally indexed to LIBOR. Impacted financial arrangements extending beyond 2021 may require contractual amendment or termination to fully adapt to a post-LIBOR environment. Duke Energy is assessing these financial arrangements and is evaluating the use of optional expedients outlined in the new accounting guidance. Alternative index provisions are also being assessed and incorporated into new financial arrangements that extend beyond 2021. The full outcome of the transition away from LIBOR cannot be determined at this time, but is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.\n2. BUSINESS SEGMENTS\nReportable segments are determined based on information used by the chief operating decision-maker in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of the business. Duke Energy evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends. Segment income, as discussed below, includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain governance costs are allocated to each segment. In addition, direct interest expense and income taxes are included in segment income.\nProducts and services are sold between affiliate companies and reportable segments of Duke Energy at cost. Segment assets as presented in the tables that follow exclude all intercompany assets.\nDuke Energy\nDuke Energy's segment structure includes the following segments: Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables.\nThe Electric Utilities and Infrastructure segment includes Duke Energy's regulated electric utilities in the Carolinas, Florida and the Midwest. The regulated electric utilities conduct operations through the Subsidiary Registrants that are substantially all regulated and, accordingly, qualify for regulatory accounting treatment. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure also includes Duke Energy's electric transmission infrastructure investments.\nThe Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment includes Piedmont, Duke Energy's natural gas local distribution companies in Ohio and Kentucky, and Duke Energy's natural gas storage and midstream pipeline investments. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure's operations are substantially all regulated and, accordingly, qualify for regulatory accounting treatment.\nThe Commercial Renewables segment is primarily comprised of nonregulated utility-scale wind and solar generation assets located throughout the U.S.\nThe remainder of Duke Energy\u2019s operations is presented as Other, which is primarily comprised of interest expense on holding company debt, unallocated corporate costs and Duke Energy\u2019s wholly owned captive insurance company, Bison. Other also includes Duke Energy's interest in NMC. See Note 12 for additional information on the investment in NMC.\nBusiness segment information is presented in the following tables. Segment assets presented exclude intercompany assets.\n(a) Electric Utilities and Infrastructure includes $948 million of Impairment charges and a reversal of $152 million included in Regulated electric operating revenue related to the CCR Settlement Agreement filed with the NCUC. Additionally, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure includes $19 million of Impairment charges related to the Clemson University Combined Heat and Power Plant, $5 million of Impairment charges related to the gas pipeline assets and $16 million of shareholder contributions within Operations, maintenance and other related to Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' 2019 North Carolina rate cases. See Note 3 for additional information.\n(b) Gas Utilities and Infrastructure includes $2.1 billion recorded within Equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and $7 million of Impairment charges related to gas pipeline investments. See Notes 3 and 12 for additional information.\n(c) Other includes a $98 million reversal of 2018 severance costs due to a partial settlement in the Duke Energy Carolinas' 2019 North Carolina rate case. See Note 3 and 20 for additional information.\n(a) Electric Utilities and Infrastructure includes a $27 million reduction of a prior year impairment at Citrus County CC related to the plant's cost cap. See Note 3 for additional information.\n(b) Gas Utilities and Infrastructure includes an after-tax impairment charge of $19 million for the remaining investment in Constitution. See Note 12 for additional information.\n(a) All segments include adjustments to the December 31, 2017, estimate of the income tax effects of the Tax Act. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure includes a $24 million expense, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure includes a $1 million expense, Commercial Renewables includes a $3 million benefit and Other includes a $2 million benefit. See Note 23 for additional information.\n(b) Electric Utilities and Infrastructure includes after-tax regulatory and legislative impairment charges of $202 million related to rate case orders, settlements or other actions of regulators or legislative bodies and an after-tax impairment charge of $46 million related to the Citrus County CC at Duke Energy Florida. See Note 3 for additional information.\n(c) Gas Utilities and Infrastructure includes an after-tax impairment charge of $42 million for the investment in Constitution. See Note 12 for additional information.\n(d) Commercial Renewables includes an impairment charge of $91 million, net of $2 million Noncontrolling interests, related to goodwill. See Note 11 for additional information.\n(e) Other includes $65 million of after-tax costs to achieve the Piedmont merger, $144 million of after-tax severance charges related to a companywide initiative and an $82 million after-tax loss on the sale of Beckjord described below. For additional information, see Note 1 for the Piedmont merger and Note 20 for severance charges.\nIn February 2018, Duke Energy sold Beckjord, a nonregulated facility retired during 2014, and recorded a pretax loss of $106 million within Gains (Losses) on Sales of Other Assets and Other, net and $1 million within Operation, maintenance and other on Duke Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. The sale included the transfer of coal ash basins and other real property and indemnification from any and all potential future claims related to the property, whether arising under environmental laws or otherwise.\nGeographical Information\nSubstantially all assets and revenues from continuing operations are within the U.S.\nMajor Customers\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues from one customer of Duke Energy Progress are $553 million. Duke Energy Progress has one reportable segment, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure. No other Subsidiary Registrant has an individual customer representing more than 10% of its revenues.\nProducts and Services\nThe following table summarizes revenues of the reportable segments by type.\nDuke Energy Ohio\nDuke Energy Ohio has two reportable segments, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure transmits and distributes electricity in portions of Ohio and generates, distributes and sells electricity in portions of Northern Kentucky. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure transports and sells natural gas in portions of Ohio and Northern Kentucky.

Certain subsidiaries may transfer funds to the Parent by obtaining approval of the respective state regulatory commissions. These conditions imposed restrictions on the ability of the public utility subsidiaries to pay cash dividends as discussed below.\nDuke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures, which in certain circumstances, limit their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on common stock. Amounts restricted as a result of these provisions were not material at December 31, 2020.\nDuke Energy Indiana has certain dividend restrictions as a result of the agreement entered in January 2021 to sell a minority interest to GIC. Duke Energy Indiana will not declare a dividend prior to the first closing, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021, and will declare dividends between the first closing and the second closing, which is required to be completed no later than January 2023, in accordance with the sale agreement. See additional information in Note 1.\nAdditionally, certain other subsidiaries of Duke Energy have restrictions on their ability to dividend, loan or advance funds to Duke Energy due to specific legal or regulatory restrictions, including, but not limited to, minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements.\nThe restrictions discussed below were not a material amount of Duke Energy's and Progress Energy's net assets at December 31, 2020.\nDuke Energy Carolinas\nDuke Energy Carolinas must limit cumulative distributions subsequent to mergers to (i) the amount of retained earnings on the day prior to the closing of the mergers, plus (ii) any future earnings recorded.\nDuke Energy Progress\nDuke Energy Progress must limit cumulative distributions subsequent to the mergers between Duke Energy and Progress Energy and Duke Energy and Piedmont to (i) the amount of retained earnings on the day prior to the closing of the respective mergers, plus (ii) any future earnings recorded.\nDuke Energy Ohio\nDuke Energy Ohio will not declare and pay dividends out of capital or unearned surplus without the prior authorization of the PUCO. Duke Energy Ohio received FERC and PUCO approval to pay dividends from its equity accounts that are reflective of the amount that it would have in its retained earnings account had push-down accounting for the Cinergy merger not been applied to Duke Energy Ohio\u2019s balance sheet. The conditions include a commitment from Duke Energy Ohio that equity, adjusted to remove the impacts of push-down accounting, will not fall below 30% of total capital.\nDuke Energy Kentucky is required to pay dividends solely out of retained earnings and to maintain a minimum of 35% equity in its capital structure.\nDuke Energy Indiana\nDuke Energy Indiana must limit cumulative distributions subsequent to the merger between Duke Energy and Cinergy to (i) the amount of retained earnings on the day prior to the closing of the merger, plus (ii) any future earnings recorded.

The FERC approves rates for electric sales to wholesale customers served under cost-based rates (excluding Ohio and Indiana), as well as sales of transmission service. The FERC also regulates certification and siting of new interstate natural gas pipeline projects.\nDuke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress\n2021 Coal Ash Settlement\nOn January 22, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into the Coal Combustion Residuals Settlement Agreement (the \u201cCCR Settlement Agreement\u201d) with the North Carolina Public Staff (Public Staff), the North Carolina Attorney General\u2019s Office and the Sierra Club (collectively, the \"Settling Parties\"), which was filed with the NCUC on January 25, 2021. The CCR Settlement Agreement resolves all coal ash prudence and cost recovery issues in connection with 2019 rate cases filed by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress with the NCUC, as well as the equitable sharing issue on remand from the 2017 Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina rate cases as a result of the December 11, 2020, North Carolina Supreme Court opinion. The settlement also provides clarity on coal ash cost recovery in North Carolina for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress through January 2030 and February 2030 (the \"Term\"), respectively.\nDuke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress agreed not to seek recovery of approximately $1 billion of systemwide deferred coal ash expenditures, but will retain the ability to earn a debt and equity return during the amortization period, which shall be five years in the pending 2019 North Carolina rate cases and will be set by the NCUC in future rate case proceedings. The equity return and the amortization period on deferred coal ash costs under the 2017 Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina rate cases will remain unaffected. The equity return on deferred coal ash costs under the 2019 North Carolina rate cases and future rate cases in North Carolina will be set at 150 basis points lower than the authorized return on equity then in effect, with a capital structure composed of 48% debt and 52% equity. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress retain the ability to earn a full WACC return during the deferral period, which is the period from when costs are incurred until they are recovered in rates.\nThe Settling Parties agreed that execution by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress of a settlement agreement between themselves and the NCDEQ dated December 31, 2019, (the \u201cDEQ Settlement\u201d) and the coal ash management plans included therein or subsequently approved by DEQ are reasonable and prudent. The Settling Parties retain the right to challenge the reasonableness and prudence of actions taken by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress and costs incurred to implement the scope of work agreed upon in the DEQ Settlement, after February 1, 2020, and March 1, 2020, for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, respectively. The Settling Parties further agreed to waive rights through the Term to challenge the reasonableness or prudence of Duke Energy Carolinas\u2019 and Duke Energy Progress\u2019 historical coal ash management practices, and to waive the right to assert any arguments that future coal ash costs, including financing costs, shall be shared between either company and customers through equitable sharing or any other rate base or return adjustment that shares the revenue requirement burden of coal ash costs not otherwise disallowed due to imprudence.\nThe Settling Parties agreed to a sharing arrangement for future coal ash insurance litigation proceeds between Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress and North Carolina customers, if achieved.\nThe settlement is subject to the review and approval of the NCUC. The Settling Parties requested an expedited review by the NCUC and anticipate an order on the pending 2019 North Carolina rate cases for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress by the second quarter of 2021. On January 29, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed joint motions with the Settling Parties seeking approval of the CCR Settlement Agreement, along with supporting testimony and exhibits from Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. On February 5, 2021, the Public Staff filed testimony and exhibits supporting the CCR Settlement Agreement.\nAs a result of the CCR Settlement Agreement, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recorded a pretax charge of approximately $454 million and $494 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2020 to Impairment charges and a reversal of approximately $50 million and $102 million, respectively, to Regulated electric operating revenues on the respective Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nCOVID-19 Filings\nNorth Carolina\nOn March 10, 2020, Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 19, 2020, the NCUC issued an order directing that utilities under its jurisdiction suspend disconnections for nonpayment of utility bills during the state of emergency and allow for customers to enter into payment arrangements to pay off arrearages accumulated during the state of emergency after the end of the state of emergency. Additionally, to help mitigate the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on their customers, on March 19, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed a request with the NCUC seeking authorization to waive: (1) any late payment charges incurred by a residential or nonresidential customer, effective March 21, 2020; (2) the application of fees for checks returned for insufficient funds for residential and nonresidential customers; (3) the reconnection charge when a residential or nonresidential customer seeks to have service restored for those customers whose service was recently disconnected for nonpayment and to work with customers regarding the other requirements to restore service, including re-establishment of credit; and (4) the fees and charges associated with the use of credit cards or debit cards to pay residential electric utility bills, effective March 21, 2020. The NCUC granted the companies\u2019 request on March 20, 2020.\nOn July 29, 2020, the NCUC issued its Order Lifting Disconnection Moratorium and Allowing Collection of Arrearages Pursuant to Special Repayment Plans. The order contained the following: (1) public utilities may resume customer disconnections due to nonpayment for bills first rendered on or after September 1, 2020, after appropriate notice; (2) the late fee moratorium will continue through the end of the state of emergency or until further order of the Commission; (3) Duke Energy utilities may reinstate fees for checks returned for insufficient funds as well as transaction fees for use of credit cards or debit cards for bills first rendered on or after September 1, 2020; and (4) no sooner than September 1, 2020, the collection of past-due or delinquent accounts accrued up to and including August 31, 2020, may proceed subject to conditions. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress resumed normal billing practices as of October 1, 2020, with the exception of the billing of late payment charges. Customers were notified of the resumption of normal billing practices, the option of deferred payment arrangements and where to find assistance, if necessary. Service disconnections for nonpayment for residential customers resumed on November 2, 2020.\nDuke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed a joint petition on August 7, 2020, with the NCUC for deferral treatment of incremental costs and waived customer fees due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Comments on the joint petition were filed on November 5, 2020, and reply comments were filed on November 30, 2020. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nSouth Carolina\nOn March 13, 2020, Governor Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The governor also issued a letter on March 14, 2020, to the ORS Executive Director regarding the suspension of disconnection of essential utility services for nonpayment. On March 18, 2020, the PSCSC issued an order approving such waivers, and also approved waivers for regulations related to late fees and reconnect fees. The PSCSC's order also required utilities to track the financial impacts of actions taken pursuant to such waivers for possible reporting to the PSCSC.\nOn May 13, 2020, the ORS filed a letter with the PSCSC that included a request from Governor McMaster that utilities proceed with developing and implementing plans for phasing in normal business operations. On May 14, 2020, the PSCSC conditionally vacated the regulation waivers regarding termination of service and suspension of disconnect fees. Prior to termination, utilities are to refer past-due customers to local organizations for assistance and/or deferred payment arrangements. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed a report on June 30, 2020, as required by PSCSC order, reporting revenue impact, costs and savings related to COVID-19 to date. On August 14, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed a joint petition with the PSCSC for approval of an accounting order to defer incremental COVID-19 related costs incurred through June 30, 2020, and for the ongoing months during the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. The deferral request did not include lost revenues. Updates on cost impacts were filed on September 30, 2020, and included financial impacts through the end of August 2020. On October 16, 2020, the ORS requested the PSCSC delay taking formal action on the deferral request until the ORS and any intervenors complete discovery. The PSCSC issued an order on October 21, 2020, to grant additional time to complete discovery until January 20, 2021, and to establish a procedural schedule. Updates on cost impacts were filed on December 30, 2020, and included financial impacts through November 30, 2020. On January 15, 2021, ORS requested the PSCSC suspend the dates for the ORS report and public hearing. The ORS conferred with the companies regarding the status of the docket, and the parties mutually agreed that recently enacted federal laws addressing COVID-19 aid and recovery should be studied before further action is taken in this docket. On January 27, 2021, the PSCSC voted to grant the ORS request to suspend the virtual public hearing. ORS is to file its report on or before March 29, 2021.\nOn August 17, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed an update on their planned return to normal operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Normal billing practices resumed in South Carolina as of October 1, 2020, and service disconnections for nonpayment resumed on October 12, 2020. Customers were notified of the resumption of normal billing practices, the option of payment arrangements and where to find assistance, if necessary. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\n2020 North Carolina Storm Securitization Filings\nOn October 26, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed a joint petition with the NCUC, as agreed to in partial settlements reached in the 2019 North Carolina Rate Cases for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, seeking authorization for the financing of the costs of each utility's storm recovery activities required as a result of Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael, Hurricane Dorian and Winter Storm Diego. Specifically, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress requested that the NCUC find that their storm recovery costs and related financing costs are appropriately financed by debt secured by storm recovery property, and that the Commission issue financing orders by which each utility may accomplish such financing using a securitization structure. On January 27, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and the Public Staff filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement, which is subject to review and approval of the NCUC, resolving certain accounting issues, including agreement to support an 18- to 20-year bond period. The total revenue requirement over a proposed 20-year bond period for the storm recovery charges is approximately $287 million for Duke Energy Carolinas and $920 million for Duke Energy Progress. A remote evidentiary hearing ended on January 29, 2021, and on February 1, 2021, the NCUC granted a motion by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress for a temporary 30-day waiver of the 135-day time frame for the NCUC to issue orders on the joint petition, extending the deadline for the NCUC to issue an order to no later than April 9, 2021. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nDuke Energy Carolinas\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe following tables present the regulatory assets and liabilities recorded on Duke Energy Carolinas' Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(a) Regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from rate base unless otherwise noted.\n(b) The expected recovery or refund period varies or has not been determined.\n(c) Included in rate base.\n(d) Includes regulatory liabilities related to the change in the federal tax rate as a result of the Tax Act and the change in the North Carolina tax rate, both discussed in Note 23. Portions are included in rate base.\n(e) Pays interest on over-recovered costs in North Carolina. Includes certain purchased power costs in North Carolina and South Carolina and costs of distributed energy in South Carolina.\n(f) Recovered over the life of the associated assets.\n(g) Includes incentives on DSM/EE investments and is recovered through an annual rider mechanism.\n(h) Earns a debt and equity return on coal ash expenditures for North Carolina and South Carolina retail customers as permitted by various regulatory orders.\n(i) Recovered primarily over the average remaining service periods or life expectancies of employees covered by the benefit plans. See Note 22 for additional detail.\n2017 North Carolina Rate Case\nOn August 25, 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the NCUC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $647 million. On February 28, 2018, Duke Energy Carolinas and the Public Staff filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement resolving certain portions of the proceeding. Terms of the settlement included a return on equity of 9.9% and a capital structure of 52% equity and 48% debt. On June 22, 2018, the NCUC issued an order approving the Stipulation of Partial Settlement and requiring a revenue reduction. As a result of the June 22, 2018, order, Duke Energy Carolinas recorded a pretax charge of approximately $150 million to Impairment charges and Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The charge was primarily related to the denial of a return on the Lee Nuclear Project and the assessment of a $70 million cost of service penalty by reducing the annual recovery of deferred coal ash costs by $14 million per year over a five-year recovery period.\nThe North Carolina Attorney General and other parties separately filed Notices of Appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court. The North Carolina Supreme Court consolidated the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress appeals. On December 11, 2020, the North Carolina Supreme Court issued an opinion on the consolidated appeals of the 2018 Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress rate case orders which affirmed, in part, and reversed and remanded, in part, the NCUC\u2019s decisions. In the Opinion, the court upheld the NCUC's decision to include coal ash costs in the cost of service, as well as the NCUC\u2019s discretion to allow a return on the unamortized balance of coal ash costs. The court also remanded to the NCUC a single issue to consider the assessment of support for the Public Staff\u2019s equitable sharing argument. In response to a NCUC order seeking comments on the proposed procedure on remand, on January 11, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, the Public Staff, the North Carolina Attorney General, Sierra Club and Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates II and III filed joint comments proposing that the NCUC not hold additional evidentiary hearings, but instead rely upon existing records in the 2017 North Carolina rate cases, or in the alternative the records in the 2019 North Carolina rate cases, in deciding the issue on remand. On January 22, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into the CCR Settlement Agreement with the Settling Parties, which was filed with the NCUC on January 25, 2021. For information on a proposed settlement pending before the NCUC, see \"2021 Coal Ash Settlement.\" Duke Energy Carolinas cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\n2019 North Carolina Rate Case\nOn September 30, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the NCUC for a net rate increase for retail customers of approximately $291 million, which represented an approximate 6% increase in annual base revenues. The gross rate case revenue increase request was $445 million, which was offset by an EDIT rider of $154 million to return to customers North Carolina and federal EDIT resulting from recent reductions in corporate tax rates. The request for a rate increase was driven by major capital investments subsequent to the previous base rate case, coal ash pond closure costs, accelerated coal plant depreciation and deferred 2018 storm costs. Duke Energy Carolinas requested rates be effective no later than August 1, 2020. The NCUC established a procedural schedule with an evidentiary hearing to begin on March 23, 2020. On March 16, 2020, in consideration of public health and safety as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a motion with the NCUC seeking a suspension of the procedural schedule in the rate case, including issuing discovery requests, and postponement of the evidentiary hearing for 60 days. Also on March 16, 2020, the NCUC issued an Order Postponing Hearing and Addressing Procedural Matters, which postponed the evidentiary hearing until further order by the Commission.\nOn March 25, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas and the Public Staff filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement, which is subject to review and approval of the NCUC, resolving certain issues in the base rate proceeding. Major components of the settlement included:\n\u2022Removal of deferred storm costs from the rate case;\n\u2022Filing a petition seeking to securitize the deferred storm costs within 120 days of a commission order in this rate case regarding the reasonableness and prudency of the storm costs;\n\u2022Agreement of certain assumptions to demonstrate the quantifiable benefits to customers of a securitization financing; and\n\u2022Agreement on certain accounting matters, including recovery of employee incentives, severance, aviation costs and executive compensation.\nOn May 6, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and the Public Staff filed a joint motion requesting that the NCUC issue an order scheduling one consolidated evidentiary hearing to consider the companies\u2019 applications for net rate increases. On June 17, 2020, the NCUC issued an order adopting procedures for the expert witness hearings to take place in three phases: (1) a hearing on issues common to both rate cases conducted remotely; (2) a hearing on Duke Energy Carolinas specific rate case issues, followed immediately by; (3) a hearing on Duke Energy Progress specific rate case issues. On July 24, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas filed its request for approval of its notice to customers required to implement temporary rates. On July 27, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a joint motion with Duke Energy Progress and the Public Staff notifying the Commission that the parties reached a joint partial settlement with the Public Staff. Also, on July 27, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a letter stating that it intended to update its temporary rates calculation to reflect the terms of the partial settlement.\nOn July 31, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas and the Public Staff filed a Second Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement (Second Partial Settlement), which is subject to review and approval of the NCUC, resolving certain remaining issues in the base rate proceeding. Major components of the Second Partial Settlement included:\n\u2022A return on equity of 9.6% and a capital structure of 52% equity and 48% debt;\n\u2022Agreement on amortization over a five-year period for unprotected federal EDIT flowbacks to customers;\n\u2022Agreement on the inclusion of plant in service and other revenue requirement updates through May 31, 2020, subject to Public Staff review. Annual revenue requirement associated with the May 31 update is estimated at $45 million; and\n\u2022Settlement to allow the deferral of costs for certain grid projects placed in service between June 1, 2020, and December 31, 2022, totaling $0.8 billion.\nThe remaining items litigated at hearing included recovery of deferred coal ash compliance costs that are subject to asset retirement obligation accounting, implementation of new depreciation rates and the amortization period of the loss on the hydro station sale.\nOn August 4, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an amended motion for approval of its amended notice to customers, seeking to exercise its statutory right to implement temporary rates subject to refund on or after August 24, 2020. The revenue requirement to be recovered, subject to refund, through the temporary rates is based on and consistent with the base rate component of the Second Partial Settlement with the Public Staff and excludes the items to be litigated noted above. Duke Energy Carolinas will not begin the amortization or implementation of these items until a final order is issued in the rate case and new base rates are implemented. These items will also be excluded when determining whether a refund of amounts collected through these temporary rates is needed. In addition, Duke Energy Carolinas also seeks authorization to place a temporary decrement EDIT Rider into effect, concurrent with the temporary base rate change. The temporary rate changes are not final rates and remain subject to the NCUC's determination of the just and reasonable rates to be charged by Duke Energy Carolinas on a permanent basis. The NCUC approved the August 4, 2020 amended temporary rates motion on August 6, 2020, and temporary rates went into effect on August 24, 2020.\nThe Duke Energy Carolinas evidentiary hearing concluded on September 18, 2020, and post-hearing filings were made with the NCUC from all parties by November 4, 2020. On January 22, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into the CCR Settlement Agreement with the Settling Parties, which was filed with the NCUC on January 25, 2021. Duke Energy Carolinas expects the NCUC to issue an order on its net rate increase by the second quarter of 2021. For information on a proposed settlement pending before the NCUC, see \"2021 Coal Ash Settlement.\" Duke Energy Carolinas cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\n2018 South Carolina Rate Case\nOn November 8, 2018, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the PSCSC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $168 million.\nAfter hearings in March 2019, the PSCSC issued an order on May 21, 2019, which included a return on equity of 9.5% and a capital structure of 53% equity and 47% debt. The order also included the following material components:\n\u2022Approval of cancellation of the Lee Nuclear Project, with Duke Energy Carolinas maintaining the Combined Operating License;\n\u2022Approval of recovery of $125 million (South Carolina retail portion) of Lee Nuclear Project development costs (including AFUDC through December 2017) over a 12-year period, but denial of a return on the deferred balance of costs;\n\u2022Approval of recovery of $96 million of coal ash costs over a five-year period with a return at Duke Energy Carolinas' WACC;\n\u2022Denial of recovery of $115 million of certain coal ash costs deemed to be related to the Coal Ash Act and incremental to the federal CCR rule;\n\u2022Approval of a $66 million decrease to base rates to reflect the change in ongoing tax expense, primarily the reduction in the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%;\n\u2022Approval of a $45 million decrease through the EDIT Rider to return EDIT resulting from the federal tax rate change and deferred revenues since January 2018 related to the change, to be returned in accordance with the Average Rate Assumption Method (ARAM) for protected EDIT, over a 20-year period for unprotected EDIT associated with Property, Plant and Equipment, over a five-year period for unprotected EDIT not associated with Property, Plant and Equipment and over a five-year period for the deferred revenues; and\n\u2022Approval of a $17 million decrease through the EDIT Rider related to reductions in the North Carolina state income tax rate from 6.9% to 2.5% to be returned over a five-year period.\nAs a result of the order, revised customer rates were effective June 1, 2019. On May 31, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a Petition for Rehearing or Reconsideration of that order contending substantial rights of Duke Energy Carolinas were prejudiced by unlawful, arbitrary and capricious rulings by the PSCSC on certain issues presented in the proceeding. On June 19, 2019, the PSCSC issued a Directive denying Duke Energy Carolinas' request to rehear or reconsider the Commission's rulings on certain issues presented in the proceeding including coal ash remediation and disposal costs, return on equity and the recovery of a return on deferred operation and maintenance expenses. An order detailing the Commission's decision in the Directive was issued on October 18, 2019. Duke Energy Carolinas filed a notice of appeal on November 15, 2019, with the Supreme Court of South Carolina. On November 20, 2019, the South Carolina Energy Users Committee filed a Notice of Appeal and the ORS filed a Notice of Cross Appeal with the Supreme Court of South Carolina. On February 12, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas and the ORS filed a joint motion to extend briefing schedule deadlines, which was approved by the Supreme Court of South Carolina on February 20, 2020. On March 10, 2020, the ORS filed a consent motion requesting withdrawal of their appeal, which was granted by the Supreme Court of South Carolina on April 30, 2020. Initial briefs were filed on April 21, 2020, which included the South Carolina Energy User's Committee brief arguing that the PSCSC erred in allowing Duke Energy Carolinas' recovery of costs related to the Lee Nuclear Station. Response briefs were filed on July 6, 2020, and reply briefs were filed on August 11, 2020. Oral arguments have not yet been scheduled by the Supreme Court of South Carolina. Based on legal analysis and the filing of the appeal, Duke Energy Carolinas has not recorded an adjustment for its deferred coal ash costs in this matter. Duke Energy Carolinas cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nDuke Energy Progress\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe following tables present the regulatory assets and liabilities recorded on Duke Energy Progress' Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(a) Regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from rate base unless otherwise noted.\n(b) The expected recovery or refund period varies or has not been determined.\n(c) Recovery period for costs related to nuclear facilities runs through the decommissioning period of each unit.\n(d) South Carolina storm costs are included in rate base.\n(e) Included in rate base.\n(f) Pays interest on over-recovered costs in North Carolina. Includes certain purchased power costs in North Carolina and South Carolina and costs of distributed energy in South Carolina.\n(g) South Carolina retail allocated costs are earning a return.\n(h) Earns a debt and equity return on coal ash expenditures for North Carolina and South Carolina retail customers as permitted by various regulatory orders.\n(i) Includes incentives on DSM/EE investments and is recovered through an annual rider mechanism.\n(j) Recovered over the life of the associated assets.\n(k) Recovered primarily over the average remaining service periods or life expectancies of employees covered by the benefit plans. See Note 22 for additional detail.\n(l) Includes regulatory liabilities related to the change in the federal tax rate as a result of the Tax Act and the change in the North Carolina tax rate, both discussed in Note 23. Portions are included in rate base.\n2017 North Carolina Rate Case\nOn June 1, 2017, Duke Energy Progress filed an application with the NCUC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $477 million, which was subsequently adjusted to $420 million. On November 22, 2017, Duke Energy Progress and the Public Staff filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement resolving certain portions of the proceeding. Terms of the settlement included a return on equity of 9.9% and a capital structure of 52% equity and 48% debt. On February 23, 2018, the NCUC issued an order approving the stipulation. The order also impacted certain amounts that were similarly recorded on Duke Energy Carolinas' Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result of the order, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas recorded pretax charges of $68 million and $14 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2018 to Impairment charges, Operation, maintenance and other and Interest Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Public Staff, the North Carolina Attorney General and the Sierra Club filed notices of appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court.\nThe North Carolina Supreme Court consolidated the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress appeals. On December 11, 2020, the North Carolina Supreme Court issued an opinion on the consolidated appeals of the 2018 Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress rate case orders which affirmed, in part, and reversed and remanded, in part, the NCUC\u2019s decisions. In the Opinion, the court upheld the NCUC's decision to include coal ash costs in the cost of service, as well as the NCUC\u2019s discretion to allow a return on the unamortized balance of coal ash costs. The court also remanded to the NCUC a single issue to consider the assessment of support for the Public Staff\u2019s equitable sharing argument. In response to a NCUC order seeking comments on the proposed procedure on remand, on January 11, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, the Public Staff, the North Carolina Attorney General, Sierra Club and Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates II and III filed joint comments proposing that the NCUC not hold additional evidentiary hearings, but instead rely upon existing records in the 2017 North Carolina rate cases or in the alternative the records in the 2019 North Carolina rate cases, in deciding the issue on remand. On January 22, 2021, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas entered into the CCR Settlement Agreement with the Settling Parties, which was filed with the NCUC on January 25, 2021. For information on the proposed settlement pending before the NCUC, see \"2021 Coal Ash Settlement.\" Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\n2019 North Carolina Rate Case\nOn October 30, 2019, Duke Energy Progress filed an application with the NCUC for a net rate increase for retail customers of approximately $464 million, which represented an approximate 12.3% increase in annual base revenues. The gross rate case revenue increase request was $586 million, which was offset by riders of $122 million, primarily an EDIT rider of $120 million to return to customers North Carolina and federal EDIT resulting from recent reductions in corporate tax rates. The request for rate increase was driven by major capital investments subsequent to the previous base rate case, coal ash pond closure costs, accelerated coal plant depreciation and deferred 2018 storm costs. Duke Energy Progress seeks to defer and recover incremental Hurricane Dorian storm costs in this proceeding and requests rates be effective no later than September 1, 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 24, 2020, the NCUC suspended the procedural schedule and postponed the previously scheduled evidentiary hearing on this matter indefinitely. On April 7, 2020, the NCUC issued an order partially resuming the procedural schedule requiring intervenors to file direct testimony on April 13, 2020. Public Staff filed supplemental direct testimony on April 23, 2020. Duke Energy Progress filed rebuttal testimony on May 4, 2020.\nOn June 2, 2020, Duke Energy Progress and the Public Staff filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement, which is subject to review and approval of the NCUC, resolving certain issues in the base rate proceeding. Major components of the settlement included:\n\u2022Removal of deferred storm costs from the rate case;\n\u2022Filing a petition seeking to securitize the deferred storm costs within 120 days of a commission order in this rate case regarding the reasonableness and prudency of the storm costs;\n\u2022Agreement of certain assumptions to demonstrate the quantifiable benefits to customers of a securitization financing;\n\u2022Agreement that the Asheville CC project is complete and in service and agreement on the amount to be included in rate base; and\n\u2022Agreement on certain accounting matters, including recovery of employee incentives, severance, aviation costs and executive compensation.\nOn May 6, 2020, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Carolinas and the Public Staff filed a joint motion requesting that the NCUC issue an order scheduling one consolidated evidentiary hearing to consider the companies\u2019 applications for net rate increases. On June 17, 2020, the NCUC issued an order adopting procedures for the expert witness hearings to take place in three phases: (1) a hearing on issues common to both rate cases conducted remotely; (2) a hearing on Duke Energy Carolinas specific rate case issues, followed immediately by; (3) a hearing on Duke Energy Progress specific rate case issues. On July 27, 2020, Duke Energy Progress filed a joint motion with Duke Energy Carolinas and the Public Staff notifying the Commission that the parties reached a joint partial settlement with the Public Staff.\nOn July 31, 2020, Duke Energy Progress and the Public Staff filed a Second Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement (Second Partial Settlement), which is subject to review and approval of the NCUC, resolving certain remaining issues in the base rate proceeding. Major components of the Second Partial Settlement included:\n\u2022A return on equity of 9.6% and a capital structure of 52% equity and 48% debt;\n\u2022Agreement on amortization over a five-year period for unprotected federal EDIT flowbacks to customers;\n\u2022Agreement on the inclusion of plant in service and other revenue requirement updates through May 31, 2020, subject to Public Staff review. Annual revenue requirement associated with the May 31 update is estimated at $25 million; and\n\u2022Settlement to allow the deferral of costs for certain grid projects placed in service between June 1, 2020, and December 31, 2022, of $0.5 billion.\nThe remaining items litigated at hearing included recovery of deferred coal ash compliance costs that are subject to asset retirement obligation accounting and implementation of new depreciation rates.\nOn August 7, 2020, Duke Energy Progress filed a motion for approval of notice required to implement temporary rates, seeking to exercise its statutory right to implement temporary rates subject to refund on or after September 1, 2020. The revenue requirement to be recovered subject to refund through the temporary rates is based on and consistent with the terms of the base rate component of the settlement agreements with the Public Staff and excludes items to be litigated noted above. Duke Energy Progress will not begin the amortization or implementation of these items until a final determination is issued in the rate case and new base rates are implemented. These items will also be excluded when determining whether a refund of amounts collected through these temporary rates is needed. In addition, Duke Energy Progress also seeks authorization to place a temporary decrement EDIT Rider into effect, concurrent with the temporary base rate change. The temporary rate changes are not final rates and remain subject to the NCUC's determination of the just and reasonable rates to be charged by Duke Energy Progress on a permanent basis. The NCUC approved the August 7, 2020 temporary rates motion on August 11, 2020, and temporary rates went into effect on September 1, 2020.\nThe Duke Energy Progress evidentiary hearing concluded on October 6, 2020, and post-hearing filings were filed with the NCUC from all parties by December 4, 2020. On January 22, 2021, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas entered into the CCR Settlement Agreement with the Settling Parties, which was filed with the NCUC on January 25, 2021. Duke Energy Progress expects the NCUC to issue an order on its net rate increase by the second quarter of 2021. For information on a proposed settlement pending before the NCUC, see \"2021 Coal Ash Settlement.\" Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nHurricane Dorian\nHurricane Dorian reached the Carolinas in September 2019 as a Category 2 hurricane making landfall within Duke Energy Progress\u2019 service territory. Total estimated incremental operation and maintenance expenses incurred to repair and restore the system are approximately $168 million with an additional $4 million in capital investments made for restoration efforts. Approximately $145 million and $179 million of the operation and maintenance expenses are deferred in Regulatory assets within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. A request for an accounting order to defer incremental storm costs associated with Hurricane Dorian was included in Duke Energy Progress' October 30, 2019, general rate case filing with the NCUC. Terms of the June 2, 2020, Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement removed incremental storm costs from the general rate case. A petition seeking to securitize these costs, along with costs from Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael and Winter Storm Diego, was filed on October 26, 2020, with the NCUC. For information on the securitization filing, see \"2020 North Carolina Storm Securitization Filings.\" Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nOn February 7, 2020, a petition was filed with the PSCSC in the 2019 storm deferrals docket requesting deferral of approximately $22 million in operation and maintenance expenses to an existing storm deferral balance previously approved by the PSCSC. The PSCSC voted to approve the request on March 4, 2020, and issued a final order on April 7, 2020. On July 1, 2020, Duke Energy Progress filed a supplemental true up reducing the actual costs to $17 million.\n2018 South Carolina Rate Case\nOn November 8, 2018, Duke Energy Progress filed an application with the PSCSC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $59 million.\nAfter hearings in April 2019, the PSCSC issued an order on May 21, 2019, which included a return on equity of 9.5% and a capital structure of 53% equity and 47% debt. The order also included the following material components:\n\u2022Approval of recovery of $4 million of coal ash costs over a five-year period with a return at Duke Energy Progress' WACC;\n\u2022Denial of recovery of $65 million of certain coal ash costs deemed to be related to the Coal Ash Act and incremental to the federal CCR rule;\n\u2022Approval of a $17 million decrease to base rates to reflect the change in ongoing tax expense, primarily the reduction in the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%;\n\u2022Approval of a $12 million decrease through the EDIT Tax Savings Rider resulting from the federal tax rate change and deferred revenues since January 2018 related to the change, to be returned in accordance with ARAM for protected EDIT, over a 20-year period for unprotected EDIT associated with Property, Plant and Equipment, over a five-year period for unprotected EDIT not associated with Property, Plant and Equipment and over a three-year period for the deferred revenues; and\n\u2022Approval of a $12 million increase due to the expiration of EDIT related to reductions in the North Carolina state income tax rate from 6.9% to 2.5%.\nAs a result of the order, revised customer rates were effective June 1, 2019. On May 31, 2019, Duke Energy Progress filed a Petition for Rehearing or Reconsideration of that order contending substantial rights of Duke Energy Progress were prejudiced by unlawful, arbitrary and capricious rulings by the PSCSC on certain issues presented in the proceeding. On June 19, 2019, the PSCSC issued a Directive denying Duke Energy Progress' request to rehear or reconsider the Commission's rulings on certain issues presented in the proceeding including coal ash remediation and disposal costs, return on equity and the recovery of a return on deferred operation and maintenance expenses, but allowing additional litigation-related costs. As a result of the Directive allowing litigation-related costs, customer rates were revised effective July 1, 2019. An order detailing the Commission's decision in the Directive was issued on October 18, 2019. Duke Energy Progress filed a notice of appeal on November 15, 2019, with the Supreme Court of South Carolina. The ORS filed a Notice of Cross Appeal on November 20, 2019. On February 12, 2020, Duke Energy Progress and the ORS filed a joint motion to extend briefing schedule deadlines, which was approved by the Supreme Court of South Carolina on February 20, 2020. On March 10, 2020, the ORS filed a consent motion requesting withdrawal of their appeal, which was granted by the Supreme Court of South Carolina on April 30, 2020. Initial briefs were filed on April 21, 2020. Response briefs were filed on July 6, 2020, and reply briefs were filed on August 11, 2020. Oral arguments have not yet been scheduled by the Supreme Court of South Carolina. Based on legal analysis and the filing of the appeal, Duke Energy Progress has not recorded an adjustment for its deferred coal ash costs in this matter. Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nWestern Carolinas Modernization Plan\nDuke Energy Progress retired the 376-MW Asheville coal-fired plant on January 29, 2020, at which time the net book value, including associated ash basin closure costs, of $214 million was transferred from Generation facilities to be retired, net to Regulatory assets within Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn December 27, 2019, Asheville Combined Cycle Unit 5 Combustion Turbine and Unit 6 Steam Turbine Generator and the common systems that serve combined cycle units went into commercial operation. Duke Energy Progress placed the Unit 7 Combustion Turbine into commercial operation in simple-cycle mode on January 15, 2020. The Unit 8 Steam Turbine Generator went into commercial operation on April 5, 2020. On June 2, 2020, Duke Energy Progress filed a request with the PSCSC for an accounting order for the deferral of post-in-service costs incurred in connection with the addition of the Asheville combined-cycle generating plant. The petition requested the PSCSC issue an accounting order authorizing Duke Energy Progress to defer post-in-service costs including the Asheville combined-cycle\u2019s depreciation expense, property taxes, incremental operations and maintenance expenses and carrying costs at WACC of approximately $8 million annually. On June 17, 2020, the PSCSC voted to approve the petition and issued its final order on July 6, 2020.\nOn October 8, 2018, Duke Energy Progress filed an application with the NCUC for a CPCN to construct the Hot Springs Microgrid Solar and Battery Storage Facility, which was approved with certain conditions on May 10, 2019. A hearing to update the NCUC on the status of the project was held on March 5, 2020. Construction began in May 2020 with commercial operation expected to begin in October 2021.\nOn July 27, 2020, Duke Energy Progress filed an application with the NCUC for a CPCN to construct the Woodfin Solar Facility, a 5-MW solar generating facility to be constructed on a closed landfill in Buncombe County. The expert hearing was held on November 18, 2020. Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nFERC Return on Equity Complaints\nOn October 11, 2019, NCEMPA filed a complaint at the FERC against Duke Energy Progress pursuant to Section 206 of the Federal Power Act (FPA), alleging that the 11% stated return on equity (ROE) component contained in the demand formula rate in the Full Requirements Power Purchase Agreement (FRPPA) between NCEMPA and Duke Energy Progress is unjust and unreasonable. On July 16, 2020, the FERC set this matter for hearing and settlement judge procedures and established a refund effective date of October 11, 2019. In its order setting the matter for settlement, the FERC allowed for the consideration of variations to the base transmission-related ROE methodology developed in its Order No. 569-A, through the introduction of \u201cspecific facts and circumstances\u201d involving issues specific to the case. It is Duke Energy Progress\u2019 view that, in consideration of the specific facts and circumstances of risks under the provisions of the FRPPA, the stated 11% ROE is just and reasonable. The parties are currently in FERC settlement procedures. Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nOn October 16, 2020, NCEMC filed a complaint at the FERC against Duke Energy Progress pursuant to Section 206 of the FPA, alleging that the 11% stated ROE component in the demand formula rate in the Power Supply and Coordination Agreement between NCEMC and Duke Energy Progress is unjust and unreasonable. Under FPA Section 206, the earliest refund effective date that the FERC can establish is the date of the filing of the complaint. Duke Energy Progress responded to the complaint on November 20, 2020, demonstrating that the 11% ROE is just and reasonable for the service provided. The parties have filed additional pleadings. The FERC has not issued an order, and there is no deadline for the FERC to act. Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nDuke Energy Florida\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe following tables present the regulatory assets and liabilities recorded on Duke Energy Florida's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(a) Regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from rate base unless otherwise noted.\n(b) The expected recovery or refund period varies or has not been determined.\n(c) Included in rate base.\n(d) Certain costs earn/pay a return.\n(e) Earns a debt return/interest once collections begin.\n(f) Earns commercial paper rate.\n(g) Recovered primarily over the average remaining service periods or life expectancies of employees covered by the benefit plans. See Note 22 for additional detail.\nCOVID-19 Filings\nIn March 2020, Governor Ron DeSantis directed the State Health Officer of Florida to declare a public health emergency in Florida related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The governor also issued an Executive Order on March 9, 2020, in which he declared a state of emergency in Florida and directed the Director of the Division of Emergency Management to implement the state\u2019s Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan. On March 19, 2020, Duke Energy Florida filed a request to modify its tariff to allow it to waive late fees for customers, and on April 6, 2020, the FPSC issued an order approving the request. Duke Energy Florida had already voluntarily waived reconnect fees and credit card fees and ceased disconnecting customers for nonpayment. On April 2, 2020, Duke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC to accelerate a $78 million fuel cost refund to customers in the month of May 2020. Typically, the refund would be made over the course of 2021. The FPSC approved the petition on April 28, 2020. Duke Energy Florida resumed normal billing practices as of August 24, 2020, with the exception of the billing of late payment charges. Customers were notified of the resumption of normal billing practices, the option of deferred payment arrangements and where to find assistance, if necessary. Service disconnections for nonpayment for residential customers resumed on October 5, 2020.\n2021 Settlement Agreement\nOn January 14, 2021, Duke Energy Florida filed a Settlement Agreement (the \u201cSettlement\u201d) with the FPSC. The parties to the Settlement include Duke Energy Florida, the Office of Public Counsel (OPC), the Florida Industrial Power Users Group, White Springs Agricultural Chemicals, Inc. d/b/a PCS Phosphate and NUCOR Steel Florida, Inc. (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d).\nPursuant to the Settlement, the Parties agreed to a base rate stay-out provision that expires year-end 2024; however, Duke Energy Florida is allowed an increase to its base rates of an incremental $67 million in 2022, $49 million in 2023 and $79 million in 2024, subject to adjustment in the event of tax reform during the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. The Parties also agreed to a return on equity (\u201cROE\u201d) band of 8.85% to 10.85% with a midpoint of 9.85% based on a capital structure of 53% equity and 47% debt. The ROE band can be increased by 25 basis points if the average 30-year U.S. Treasury rate increases 50 basis points or more over a six-month period in which case the midpoint ROE would rise from 9.85% to 10.10%. Duke Energy Florida will also be able to retain the DOE award of $173 million for spent nuclear fuel, which is expected to be received in 2022, in order to mitigate customer rates over the term of the Settlement. In return, Duke Energy Florida will be able to recognize the $173 million into earnings from 2022 through 2024.\nIn addition to these terms, the Settlement contains provisions related to the accelerated depreciation of Crystal River Units 4-5, the approval of approximately $1 billion in future investments in new cost effective solar power, the implementation of a new Electric Vehicle Charging Station Program and the deferral and recovery of costs in connection with the implementation of Duke Energy Florida\u2019s Vision Florida program, which explores various emerging non-carbon emitting generation technology, distributed technologies and resiliency projects, among other things. The Settlement also resolves remaining unrecovered storm costs for hurricanes Dorian and Michael.\nThe Settlement is subject to the review and approval of the FPSC, which may occur in the second quarter of 2021. If the FPSC approves the Settlement, the new rates will be effective January 1, 2022, with subsequent base rate increases effective January 1, 2023, and January 1, 2024. Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nStorm Restoration Cost Recovery\nDuke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on April 30, 2019, to recover $223 million of estimated retail incremental storm restoration costs for Hurricane Michael, consistent with the provisions in the 2017 Settlement, and the FPSC approved the petition on June 11, 2019. The FPSC also approved allowing Duke Energy Florida to use the tax savings resulting from the Tax Act to recover these storm costs in lieu of implementing a storm surcharge. Approved storm costs are currently expected to be fully recovered by approximately year-end 2021. On November 22, 2019, Duke Energy Florida filed a petition for approval of actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Michael in the amount of $191 million plus interest. On May 19, 2020, Duke Energy Florida filed a supplemental true up reducing the actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Michael by approximately $3 million, resulting in a total request to recover $188 million actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs, plus interest. On November 12, 2020, Duke Energy Florida and OPC requested a 90 day abatement to engage in discussions to narrow the issues being litigated. The Prehearing Officer approved this request on November 16, 2020, and ordered Duke Energy Florida and OPC to update the commission on their discussions by February 12, 2021. Approximately $80 million and $204 million of these costs are included in Regulatory assets within Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nDuke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on December 19, 2019, to recover $169 million of estimated retail incremental storm restoration costs for Hurricane Dorian, consistent with the provisions in the 2017 Settlement and the FPSC approved the petition on February 24, 2020. Approximately $167 million of these costs are included in Regulatory assets within Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019, representing recoverable costs under the FPSC\u2019s storm rule and Duke Energy Florida's OATT formula rates. The amount at December 31, 2020 was immaterial. The final actual amount of $145 million was filed on September 30, 2020. Pursuant to the 2021 Settlement Agreement filed for FPSC approval on January 14, 2021, all matters regarding storm cost recovery relating to hurricanes Michael and Dorian have been resolved.\nClean Energy Connection\nOn July 1, 2020, Duke Energy Florida petitioned the FPSC for approval of a voluntary solar program. The program consists of 10 new solar generating facilities with combined capacity of approximately 750 MW. The program allows participants to support cost-effective solar development in Florida by paying a subscription fee based on per kilowatt-subscriptions and receiving a credit on their bill based on the actual generation associated with their portion of the solar portfolio. The estimated cost of the 10 new solar generation facilities is approximately $1 billion over the next four years, and this investment will be included in base rates offset by the revenue from the subscription fees. The credits will be included for recovery in the fuel cost recovery clause. A remote hearing was held on November 17, 2020, and post-hearing briefs were filed with the FPSC from all parties by December 9, 2020. The FPSC voted to approve the program on January 5, 2021, and issued its written order on January 26, 2021.\nCrystal River Unit 3 Accelerated Decommissioning Filing\nOn May 29, 2019, Duke Energy Florida entered into a Decommissioning Services Agreement for the accelerated decommissioning of Crystal River Unit 3 located in Citrus County, Florida, with ADP CR3, LLC and ADP SF1, LLC, each of which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Accelerated Decommissioning Partners, LLC (ADP), a joint venture between NorthStar Group Services, Inc. and Orano USA LLC. The agreement will allow for completion of the decommissioning of Crystal River Unit 3 by 2027, rather than 2074 as originally planned. Duke Energy Florida will also sell and assign the spent nuclear fuel, storage canisters, high-level waste and existing dry spent fuel storage installation and certain related assets, together with certain associated liabilities and obligations to ADP SF1, LLC. Duke Energy Florida expects that the assets of the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund as of December 31, 2020, will be sufficient to cover the contract price. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the transaction on April 1, 2020, and the FPSC issued an order approving the transaction on August 27, 2020. The transaction closed on October 1, 2020.\nCitrus County CC\nConstruction of the 1,640-MW combined-cycle natural gas plant in Citrus County, Florida, began in October 2015 with an estimated cost of $1.5 billion, including AFUDC. Both units came online in the fourth quarter of 2018. The ultimate cost of the facility was estimated to be $1.6 billion, and Duke Energy Florida recorded Impairment charges on Duke Energy\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations of $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the overrun. In the year ended December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Florida recorded a $36 million reduction to the prior year impairment due to a decrease in the cost estimate of the Citrus County CC, primarily related to the settlement agreement with Fluor, the EPC contractor. This adjustment reduced the estimated cost of the facility to $1.5 billion.\nDuke Energy Ohio\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe following tables present the regulatory assets and liabilities recorded on Duke Energy Ohio's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(a) Regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from rate base unless otherwise noted.\n(b) The expected recovery or refund period varies or has not been determined.\n(c) Included in rate base.\n(d) Recovery over the life of the associated assets.\n(e) Recovered via a rider mechanism.\n(f) Includes incentives on DSM/EE investments.\n(g) Recovered primarily over the average remaining service periods or life expectancies of employees covered by the benefit plans. See Note 22 for additional detail.\nDuke Energy Ohio COVID-19 Filings\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 9, 2020, Governor Mike DeWine declared a state of emergency in the state of Ohio. The PUCO issued an order directing utilities to cease disconnections for nonpayment and waive late payment and reconnection fees and to minimize direct customer contact. The PUCO also directed utilities to maintain flexible payment plans and tariff interpretations to assist customers during this crisis and to seek any regulatory waivers, if necessary. In response, Duke Energy Ohio ceased all disconnections except for safety-related concerns and waived late payment and reconnection fees. On March 19, 2020, Duke Energy Ohio filed its compliance plan with the PUCO and sought waiver of several regulations to minimize direct customer contact. On May 4, 2020, Duke Energy Ohio filed a motion to suspend payment rules to enable proactive outreach to residential customers offering additional options for managing their utility bills. PUCO found the proposal to address the state of emergency and the accompanying waivers reasonable and directed Duke Energy Ohio to work with the PUCO Staff on a comprehensive plan for resumption of activities and operations, to be filed 45 days before resumption of activities. The transition plan to resume normal operations to pre-COVID-19 levels was filed on June 26, 2020, and approved by the PUCO on July 29, 2020. Pursuant to the transition plan, suspended work and activities resumed beginning August 10, 2020, and disconnections resumed on September 8, 2020, for nonresidential customers and October 5, 2020, for residential customers.\nOn April 16, 2020, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application for a Reasonable Arrangement to temporarily lower the minimum bill for demand-metered commercial and industrial customers. On June 17, 2020, the PUCO denied Duke Energy Ohio's application for a reasonable arrangement and ordered Duke Energy Ohio to work with the PUCO Staff on payment arrangements for impacted nonresidential customers.\nOn May 11, 2020, Duke Energy Ohio filed with the PUCO a request seeking deferral of incremental costs incurred, as well as specific miscellaneous lost revenues using existing uncollectible riders already in place for both electric and natural gas operations. Duke Energy Ohio would subsequently file for rider recovery at a later date. On June 17, 2020, the PUCO approved Duke Energy Ohio\u2019s deferral application. The Commission denied the accrual of carrying costs and ordered Duke Energy Ohio to also track potential savings experienced as a result of COVID-19.\nDuke Energy Kentucky COVID-19\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 6, 2020, Governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency in the commonwealth of Kentucky. The KPSC issued an order directing utilities to cease disconnections for nonpayment and waive late payment fees. The KPSC also directed utilities to maintain flexible payment plans and tariff interpretations to assist customers during this crisis and to seek any regulatory waivers, if necessary. In response, Duke Energy Kentucky ceased all disconnections except for safety-related concerns and waived late payment and reconnection fees. On September 21, 2020, the KPSC issued an order ending the disconnection moratorium for residential and nonresidential customers effective no earlier than October 20, 2020. Utilities are required to offer residential customers a default payment plan for any arrearages accumulated through the October 2020 billing cycle. Assessment of late payment charges for nonresidential customers resumed beginning October 20, 2020, and resumed for residential customers after December 31, 2020. Duke Energy Kentucky is following the order, as clarified on September 30, 2020, by the KPSC.\n2017 Electric Security Plan Filing\nOn June 1, 2017, Duke Energy Ohio filed with the PUCO a request for a standard service offer in the form of an ESP. On April 13, 2018, Duke Energy Ohio, along with certain intervenors, filed a Stipulation and Recommendation (Stipulation) with the PUCO resolving that the term of the ESP would be from June 1, 2018, to May 31, 2025, and included continuation of market-based customer rates through competitive procurement processes for generation, continuation and expansion of existing rider mechanisms and approved new rider mechanisms relating to costs incurred to enhance the customer experience and transform the grid and a service reliability rider for vegetation management. On September 13, 2019, and September 16, 2019, Interstate Gas Supply/Retail Supply Association and the Ohio Consumers' Counsel (OCC), respectively, filed appeals to the Supreme Court of Ohio claiming the PUCO\u2019s order was in error. On March 13, 2020, the Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed OCC's appeal. On April 22, 2020, the Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed all remaining appeals of the PUCO's December 19, 2018 order approving the Stipulation. The case has been resolved.\nElectric Base Rate Case\nDuke Energy Ohio filed with the PUCO an electric distribution base rate case application and supporting testimony in March 2017. Duke Energy Ohio requested an estimated annual increase of approximately $15 million and a return on equity of 10.4%. On April 13, 2018, Duke Energy Ohio, along with certain intervenors, filed the Stipulation with the PUCO including a $19 million decrease in annual base distribution revenue with a return on equity unchanged from the current rate of 9.84% based upon a capital structure of 50.75% equity and 49.25% debt. Upon approval of new rates, Duke Energy Ohio's rider for recovering its initial SmartGrid implementation ended as these costs would be recovered through base rates. The Stipulation also renewed 14 existing riders, some of which were included in Duke Energy Ohio's ESP, and added two new riders including the Enhanced Service Reliability Rider to recover vegetation management costs not included in base rates, up to $10 million per year (operation and maintenance only) and the Power Future Initiatives Rider (formerly PowerForward Rider) to recover costs incurred to enhance the customer experience and further transform the grid (operation and maintenance and capital). In addition to the changes in revenue attributable to the Stipulation, Duke Energy Ohio\u2019s capital-related riders, including the Distribution Capital Investments Rider, began to reflect the lower federal income tax rate associated with the Tax Act with updates to customers\u2019 bills beginning April 1, 2018. This change reduced electric revenue by approximately $20 million on an annualized basis. On December 19, 2018, the PUCO approved the Stipulation without material modification. New base rates were implemented effective January 2, 2019. On September 13, 2019, and September 16, 2019, Interstate Gas Supply/Retail Supply Association and the OCC, respectively, filed appeals to the Supreme Court of Ohio claiming the PUCO\u2019s order was in error. On March 13, 2020, the Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed the OCC's appeal. On April 22, 2020, the Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed all remaining appeals of the PUCO's December 19, 2018 order approving the Stipulation. The case has been resolved.\nOhio Valley Electric Corporation\nOn March 31, 2017, Duke Energy Ohio filed for approval to adjust its existing Rider PSR to pass through net costs related to its contractual entitlement to capacity and energy from the generating assets owned by OVEC. Duke Energy Ohio sought deferral authority for net costs incurred from April 1, 2017, until the new rates under Rider PSR were put into effect. On April 13, 2018, Duke Energy Ohio, along with certain intervenors, filed a Stipulation with the PUCO resolving numerous issues including those related to Rider PSR. The Stipulation activated Rider PSR for recovery of net costs incurred from January 1, 2018, through May 2025. On December 19, 2018, the PUCO approved the Stipulation without material modification. The PSR rider became effective April 1, 2019. On September 13, 2019, and September 16, 2019, Interstate Gas Supply/Retail Supply Association and the OCC filed appeals to the Supreme Court of Ohio claiming the PUCO\u2019s order was in error. On March 13, 2020, the Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed OCC's appeal. On April 22, 2020, the Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed all remaining appeals of the PUCO's December 19, 2018 order approving the Stipulation. The case has been resolved.\nOn July 23, 2019, House Bill 6 (HB 6) was signed into law that became effective January 1, 2020. Among other things, the bill allows for funding through a rider mechanism referred to as the Clean Air Fund (Rider CAF), of two nuclear generating facilities located in Northern Ohio owned by Energy Harbor (f/k/a FirstEnergy Solutions), repeal of energy efficiency mandates and recovery of prudently incurred costs, net of any revenues, for Ohio investor-owned utilities that are participants under the OVEC power agreement. The recovery is through a non-bypassable rider that replaced any existing recovery mechanism approved by the PUCO and will remain in place through 2030. As such, Duke Energy Ohio created the Legacy Generation Rider (Rider LGR) that replaced Rider PSR effective January 1, 2020. The amounts recoverable from customers are subject to an annual cap, with incremental costs that exceed such cap eligible for deferral and recovery subject to review. See Note 17 for additional discussion of Duke Energy Ohio's ownership interest in OVEC. In July 2020, legislation to repeal HB 6 was proposed in both the Ohio House and Senate, with subsequent hearings to receive witness testimony. On December 21, 2020, the Franklin County Circuit Court issued an injunction against the PUCO\u2019s Order that approved the nuclear plant funding through Rider CAF set to become effective on January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, in a separate proceeding, the Ohio Supreme Court, ordered a temporary stay on the implementation of Rider CAF. Duke Energy Ohio is not impacted by any changes in Rider CAF. The General Assembly\u2019s session ended without addressing HB 6. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nTax Act - Ohio\nOn December 21, 2018, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application to change its base rate tariffs and establish a new rider to implement the benefits of the Tax Act for natural gas customers. Duke Energy Ohio requested commission approval to implement the changes and rider effective April 1, 2019. The new rider will flow through to customers the benefit of the lower statutory federal tax rate from 35% to 21% since January 1, 2018, all future benefits of the lower tax rates and a full refund of deferred income taxes collected at the higher tax rates in prior years. Deferred income taxes subject to normalization rules will be refunded consistent with federal law and deferred income taxes not subject to normalization rules will be refunded over a 10-year period. The PUCO established a procedural schedule and testimony was filed on July 31, 2019. An evidentiary hearing occurred on August 7, 2019. Initial briefs were filed on September 11, 2019. Reply briefs were filed on September 25, 2019. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nEnergy Efficiency Cost Recovery\nOn February 26, 2020, the PUCO issued an order directing utilities to wind down their demand-side management programs by September 30, 2020, and to terminate the programs by December 31, 2020, in response to changes in Ohio law that eliminated Ohio's energy efficiency mandates. On March 27, 2020, Duke Energy Ohio filed an Application for Rehearing seeking clarification on the final true up and reconciliation process after 2020. On April 22, 2020, the PUCO granted rehearing for further consideration. The PUCO issued two orders on November 18, 2020, on the application for rehearing. The first order was a Third Entry on Rehearing on the Duke Energy Ohio portfolio holding the cost cap previously imposed was unlawful, a shared savings cap of $8 million pretax should be imposed and lost distribution revenues could not be recovered after December 31, 2020. The second order directs all utilities set the rider to zero effective January 1, 2021, and to file a separate application for final reconciliation of all energy efficiency costs prior to December 31, 2020. On December 18, 2020, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application for rehearing. On January 13, 2021, the application for rehearing was granted for further consideration. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nOn October 9, 2020, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application to implement a voluntary efficiency program portfolio to commence on January 1, 2021. The application proposes a mechanism for recovery of program costs and a benefit associated with avoided transmission and distribution costs. The application remains under review. As of January 1, 2021, Duke Energy Ohio suspended its energy efficiency programs due to changes in Ohio law. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nNatural Gas Pipeline Extension\nDuke Energy Ohio is proposing to install a new natural gas pipeline (the Central Corridor Project) in its Ohio service territory to increase system reliability and enable the retirement of older infrastructure. Duke Energy Ohio currently estimates the pipeline development costs and construction activities will range from $163 million to $245 million in direct costs (excluding overheads and AFUDC) and that construction of the pipeline extension is expected to be completed before the 2021/2022 winter season. An evidentiary hearing for a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need concluded on April 11, 2019. On November 21, 2019, the Ohio Power Siting Board (OPSB) approved Duke Energy Ohio's application subject to 41 conditions on construction. Applications for rehearing were filed by several stakeholders on December 23, 2019, arguing that the OPSB approval was incorrect. On February 20, 2020, the OPSB denied the rehearing requests. On April 15, 2020, Joint Appellants filed a notice of appeal at the Supreme Court of Ohio of the OPSB\u2019s decision approving Duke Energy Ohio\u2019s Central Corridor application. On June 4, 2020, the OPSB filed a motion to dismiss claims raised by one of the Joint Appellants and on August 5, 2020, the Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed one of the Joint Appellants from the appeal. Joint Appellants filed their merit briefs on August 26, 2020. Appellee briefs were filed October 15, 2020. Appellants' briefs were filed on November 24, 2020. On September 22, 2020, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application with the OPSB for approval to amend the certificated pipeline route due to changes in the route negotiated with property owners and municipalities. The staff report was filed on December 21, 2020, recommending approval subject to three conditions that reaffirm previous conditions, and provide guidance regarding local permitting and construction supervision.. On December 23, 2020, Duke Energy Ohio filed a letter indicating its acceptance of these conditions if required by the OPSB. On January 21, 2021, the OPSB approved the amended filing with the recommended conditions. On January 27, 2021, the Ohio Supreme Court set oral argument for March 31, 2021. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nMGP Cost Recovery\nAs part of its 2012 natural gas base rate case, Duke Energy Ohio has approval to defer and recover costs related to environmental remediation at two sites (East End and West End) that housed former MGP operations. Duke Energy Ohio has collected approximately $55 million in environmental remediation costs incurred between 2009 through 2012 through Rider MGP, which is currently suspended. Duke Energy Ohio has made annual applications with the PUCO to recover its incremental remediation costs consistent with the PUCO\u2019s directive in Duke Energy Ohio\u2019s 2012 natural gas base rate case. To date, the PUCO has not ruled on Duke Energy Ohio\u2019s annual applications for the calendar years 2013 through 2019. On September 28, 2018, the staff of the PUCO issued a report recommending a disallowance of approximately $12 million of the $26 million in MGP remediation costs incurred between 2013 through 2017 that staff believes are not eligible for recovery. Staff interprets the PUCO\u2019s 2012 Order granting Duke Energy Ohio recovery of MGP remediation as limiting the recovery to work directly on the East End and West End sites. On October 30, 2018, Duke Energy Ohio filed reply comments objecting to the staff\u2019s recommendations and explaining, among other things, the obligation Duke Energy Ohio has under Ohio law to remediate all areas impacted by the former MGPs and not just physical property that housed the former plants and equipment. On March 29, 2019, Duke Energy Ohio filed its annual application to recover incremental remediation expense for the calendar year 2018 seeking recovery of approximately $20 million in remediation costs. On July 12, 2019, the staff recommended a disallowance of approximately $11 million for work that staff believes occurred in areas not authorized for recovery. Additionally, staff recommended that any discussion pertaining to Duke Energy Ohio's recovery of ongoing MGP costs should be directly tied to or netted against insurance proceeds collected by Duke Energy Ohio. An evidentiary hearing concluded on November 21, 2019. Initial briefs were filed on January 17, 2020, and reply briefs were filed on February 14, 2020. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nOn March 31, 2020, Duke Energy Ohio filed its annual application to recover incremental remediation expense for the calendar year 2019 seeking recovery of approximately $39 million in remediation costs incurred during 2019. On July 23, 2020, the staff recommended a disallowance of approximately $4 million for work the staff believes occurred in areas not authorized for recovery. Additionally, the staff recommended insurance proceeds, net of litigation costs and attorney fees, should be reimbursed to customers and not be held by Duke Energy Ohio until all investigation and remediation is complete. Duke Energy Ohio filed comments in response to the staff report on August 21, 2020, and intervenor comments were filed on November 9, 2020. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nThe 2012 PUCO order also contained conditional deadlines for completing the MGP environmental remediation and the deferral of remediation costs at the MGP sites. Subsequent to the order, the deadline was extended to December 31, 2019. On May 10, 2019, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application requesting a continuation of its existing deferral authority for MGP remediation that must occur after December 31, 2019. On July 12, 2019, staff recommended the Commission deny the deferral authority request. On September 13, 2019, intervenor comments were filed opposing Duke Energy Ohio's request for continuation of existing deferral authority and on October 2, 2019, Duke Energy Ohio filed reply comments. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nDuke Energy Kentucky Electric Base Rate Case\nOn September 3, 2019, Duke Energy Kentucky filed a rate case with the KPSC requesting an increase in electric base rates of approximately $46 million. On January 31, 2020, Duke Energy Kentucky filed rebuttal testimony updating its rate increase request to approximately $44 million. Hearings concluded on February 20, 2020, and briefing was completed March 20, 2020. On April 27, 2020, the KPSC issued its decision approving a $24 million increase for Duke Energy Kentucky with a 9.25% return on equity. The KPSC denied Duke Energy Kentucky\u2019s major storm deferral mechanism and EV and battery storage pilots. The KPSC approved Duke Energy Kentucky\u2019s Green Source Advantage tariff. New customer rates were effective on May 1, 2020. On May 18, 2020, Duke Energy Kentucky filed its motion for rehearing and on June 4, 2020, the motion was granted in part and denied in part by the KPSC. On October 16, 2020, the KPSC issued an Order on Rehearing authorizing an additional $4 million increase in revenue requirement bringing the total authorized revenue requirement increase to $28 million. Revised customer rates took effect in November 2020. The case has been resolved.\nRegional Transmission Organization Realignment\nDuke Energy Ohio, including Duke Energy Kentucky, transferred control of its transmission assets from MISO to PJM, effective December 31, 2011. The PUCO approved a settlement related to Duke Energy Ohio\u2019s recovery of certain costs of the RTO realignment via a non-bypassable rider. Duke Energy Ohio is allowed to recover all MISO Transmission Expansion Planning (MTEP) costs directly or indirectly charged to Ohio customers. The KPSC also approved a request to effect the RTO realignment, subject to a commitment not to seek double recovery in a future rate case of the transmission expansion fees that may be charged by MISO and PJM in the same period or overlapping periods.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of Duke Energy Ohio\u2019s recorded liability for its exit obligation and share of MTEP costs recorded in Other within Current Liabilities and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The retail portions of MTEP costs billed by MISO are recovered by Duke Energy Ohio through a non-bypassable rider. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, $37 million and $40 million, respectively, are recorded in Regulatory assets on Duke Energy Ohio's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDuke Energy Indiana\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe following tables present the regulatory assets and liabilities recorded on Duke Energy Indiana's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(a) Regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from rate base unless otherwise noted.\n(b) The expected recovery or refund period varies or has not been determined.\n(c) Included in rate base.\n(d) Refunded over the life of the associated assets.\n(e) Recovered primarily over the average remaining service periods or life expectancies of employees covered by the benefit plans. See Note 22 for additional detail.\nCOVID-19 Filing\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 6, 2020, Governor Eric Holcomb declared a public health disaster emergency in the state of Indiana, which is currently still in effect. At that time, Duke Energy Indiana had already voluntarily suspended all disconnections and waived late payment fees and check return fees. The utility also waived credit card fees for residential customers. The Executive Order requiring utilities in the state to suspend disconnection of utility service expired July 1, 2020.\nOn May 8, 2020, Duke Energy Indiana, along with other Indiana utilities, filed a request with the IURC for approval of deferral treatment for costs and revenue reductions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The utilities requested initial deferral approval in July 2020, with individual subdockets for each utility to be established for consideration of utility-specific cost and revenue impacts, cost recovery timing and customer payment plans. On June 29, 2020, the IURC issued an order in Phase 1 wherein it extended the disconnection moratorium for jurisdictional utilities until August 14, 2020, along with requiring six-month payment arrangements, waiver of late fees, reconnection fees, convenience fees and deposits. The IURC permitted jurisdictional utilities to use regulatory accounting for any impacts associated with the prohibition on utility disconnections, waiver or exclusion of certain utility fees (i.e., late fees, convenience fees, deposits, and reconnection fees), the use of expanded payment arrangements to aid customers, and for COVID-19 related uncollectible and incremental bad debt expense. The IURC did not permit recovery of lost revenues due to load reduction or carrying costs. In Phase 2 filings, individual utilities may choose to request regulatory accounting for other COVID-19 related operation and maintenance costs wherein evidence of the impact of any costs or offsetting savings can be presented and considered in an evidentiary hearing. On August 12, 2020, the IURC issued a supplemental order extending the requirement for six-month payment arrangements and waiver of certain customer fees for another 60 days but did not extend the disconnect moratorium. As such, Duke Energy Indiana resumed service disconnections for nonpayment in mid-September 2020. Normal billing practices resumed in mid-October 2020, except that Duke Energy Indiana has committed to provide extended payment arrangements into 2021 and to waive credit card and pay station fees for residential customers through the end of 2020. Customers were notified of the resumption of normal billing practices, the option of deferred payment arrangements and where to find assistance, if necessary. Duke Energy Indiana cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\n2019 Indiana Rate Case\nOn July 2, 2019, Duke Energy Indiana filed a general rate case with the IURC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $395 million. The rebuttal case, filed on December 4, 2019, updated the requested revenue requirement to result in a 15.6% or $396 million average retail rate increase, including the impacts of the Utility Receipts Tax. Hearings concluded on February 7, 2020. On June 29, 2020, the IURC issued the order in the rate case approving a revenue increase of $146 million before certain adjustments and ratemaking refinements. The order provided for an overall cost of capital of 5.7% based on a 9.7% return on equity and a 53% equity component of the capital structure, and approved Duke Energy Indiana's requested forecasted rate base of $10.2 billion as of December 31, 2020, including the Edwardsport Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) Plant. The IURC reduced Duke Energy Indiana's request by slightly more than $200 million, when accounting for the utility receipts tax and other adjustments. Approximately 50% of the reduction is due to a prospective change in depreciation and use of regulatory asset for the end-of-life inventory at retired generating plants, approximately 20% is due to the approved 9.7% return on equity versus requested 10.4% and approximately 20% is related to miscellaneous earnings neutral adjustments. Step one rates are estimated to be approximately 75% of the total and became effective on July 30, 2020. Step two rates are estimated to be the remaining 25% of the total rate increase and will be implemented in mid-2021. Several groups filed notices of appeal of the IURC order on July 29, 2020. Appellate briefs were filed on October 14, 2020, focusing on three issues: wholesale sales allocations, coal ash basin cost recovery and the Edwardsport IGCC operating and maintenance expense level approved. The appeal was fully briefed in January 2021, and a decision is expected in the first or second quarter of 2021. Duke Energy Indiana cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\n2020 Indiana Coal Ash Recovery Case\nIn Duke Energy Indiana\u2019s rate case, the IURC approved coal ash basin closure costs expended through 2018 including financing costs as a regulatory asset and included in rate base. The IURC opened a subdocket to deal with the post-2018 coal ash related expenditures. Duke Energy Indiana filed testimony on April 15, 2020, in the coal ash subdocket requesting recovery for the post-2018 coal ash basin closure costs for plans that have been approved by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management as well as continuing deferral, with carrying costs, on the balance. An evidentiary hearing was held on September 14, 2020, and the parties have agreed on a delayed briefing schedule that allows for the Indiana Rate Case appeal to proceed. Briefing will be completed by mid-May 2021. Duke Energy Indiana cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nPiedmont\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe following tables present the regulatory assets and liabilities recorded on Piedmont's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(a) Regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from rate base unless otherwise noted.\n(b) The expected recovery or refund period varies or has not been determined.\n(c) Included in rate base.\n(d) Recovery over the life of the associated assets.\n(e) Balance will fluctuate with changes in the market. Current contracts extend into 2031.\n(f) Recovered primarily over the average remaining service periods or life expectancies of employees covered by the benefit plans. See Note 22 for additional detail.\nCOVID-19 Filings\nNorth Carolina\nOn March 10, 2020, Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 19, 2020, the NCUC issued on order directing that utilities under its jurisdiction suspend disconnections for nonpayment of utility bills during the state of emergency and allow for customers to enter into payment arrangements to pay off arrearages accumulated during the state of emergency after the end of the state of emergency. Additionally, to help mitigate the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on their customers, on March 19, 2020, Piedmont filed a request with the NCUC seeking authorization to waive: (1) any late payment charges incurred by a residential or nonresidential customer, effective March 21, 2020; (2) the application of fees for checks returned for insufficient funds for residential and nonresidential customers; (3) the reconnection charge when a residential or nonresidential customer seeks to have service restored for those customers whose service was recently disconnected for nonpayment and to work with customers regarding the other requirements to restore service, including re-establishment of credit; and (4) the fees and charges associated with the use of credit cards or debit cards to pay residential electric utility bills, effective March 21, 2020. The NCUC granted Piedmont\u2019s request on March 20, 2020.\nOn July 29, 2020, the NCUC issued its Order Lifting Disconnection Moratorium and Allowing Collection of Arrearages Pursuant to Special Repayment Plans. The order contained the following: (1) public utilities may resume customer disconnections due to nonpayment for bills first rendered on or after September 1, 2020, after appropriate notice; (2) the late fee moratorium will continue through the end of the state of emergency or until further order of the commission; (3) Duke Energy utilities may reinstate fees for checks returned for insufficient funds as well as transaction fees for use of credit cards or debit cards for bills first rendered on or after September 1, 2020; and (4) no sooner than September 1, 2020, the collection of past-due or delinquent accounts accrued up to and including August 31, 2020, may proceed subject to conditions.\nNormal billing practices resumed as of October 1, 2020, with the exception of billing of late payment charges. Service disconnections for nonpayment resumed on November 4, 2020. Customers were notified of the resumption of normal billing practices, the option of payment arrangements and where to find assistance, if necessary. The NCUC's moratorium for the billing of late payment charges is still in effect until further order from the NCUC. Piedmont cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nSouth Carolina\nOn March 13, 2020, Governor Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The governor also issued a letter on March 14, 2020, to the ORS Executive Director regarding the suspension of disconnection of essential utility services for nonpayment. On March 18, 2020, the PSCSC issued an order approving such waivers, and also approved waivers for regulations related to late fees and reconnect fees. The PSCSC's order also required utilities to track the financial impacts of actions taken pursuant to such waivers for possible reporting to the PSCSC.\nOn May 13, 2020, the ORS filed a letter with the PSCSC that included a request from Governor McMaster that utilities proceed with developing and implementing plans for phasing in normal business operations. On May 14, 2020, the PSCSC conditionally vacated the regulation waivers regarding termination of service and suspension of disconnect fees. Prior to termination, utilities are to refer past-due customers to local organizations for assistance and/or deferred payment arrangements. Piedmont filed a report on June 30, 2020, as required by PSCSC order, reporting revenue impact, costs and savings related to COVID-19 to date. Updates on cost impacts were filed on September 30, 2020, and on December 31, 2020, and included financial impacts through the end of August 2020, and the end of November 2020, respectively.\nOn September 30, 2020, Piedmont filed an update on its planned return to normal operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Normal billing practices resumed as of October 1, 2020, and service disconnections for nonpayment resumed on November 4, 2020. Customers were notified of the resumption of normal billing practices, the option of payment arrangements and where to find assistance, if necessary.\nTennessee\nOn March 12, 2020, Governor Bill Lee declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In an effort to help mitigate the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on their customers, on March 20, 2020, Piedmont filed a request with the TPUC seeking authorization to waive, effective March 21, 2020: (1) any late payment charges incurred by a residential or nonresidential customer; (2) the application of fees for checks returned for insufficient funds for residential and nonresidential customers; and (3) the reconnection charge when a residential or nonresidential customer seeks to have service restored for those customers whose service was recently disconnected for nonpayment and to work with customers regarding the other requirements to restore service, including re-establishment of credit. The TPUC granted Piedmont\u2019s request by Order issued March 31,2020. The Order also stated that customers were not relieved of their obligation to pay for utility services received.\nThe TPUC held its regularly scheduled Commission Conference electronically on August 10, 2020, and on September 16, 2020, issued an Order Lifting Suspension of Disconnections of Service for Lack of Payment with Conditions, effective August 29, 2020. The conditions relate to required customer communications, payment plan options for past-due amounts and ongoing reporting to the TPUC. Potential recovery of costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic may be considered in future, individual docketed proceedings.\nOn October 15, 2020, Piedmont filed a report on its planned return to normal operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Normal billing practices resumed as of October 1, 2020, and service disconnections for nonpayment resumed on November 4, 2020. Customers were notified of the resumption of normal billing practices, the option of payment arrangements and where to find assistance, if necessary.\n2020 Tennessee Rate Case\nOn July 2, 2020, Piedmont filed an application with the TPUC, its first general rate case in Tennessee in nine years, for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $30 million, which represents an approximate 15% increase in annual revenues. The rate increase is driven by significant infrastructure upgrade investments since its previous rate case. Approximately half of the plant additions being added to rate base are categories of capital investment not covered under the IMR mechanism, which was approved in 2013. Piedmont amended its requested increase to approximately $26 million in December 2020. As authorized under Tennessee law, Piedmont implemented interim rates on January 2, 2021, at the level requested in its adjusted request. A settlement reached with the Tennessee Consumer Advocate in mid-January was filed with the TPUC on February 2, 2021. The settlement results in an increase of revenues of approximately $16 million and a ROE of 9.8%. At a hearing on February 16, 2021, the TPUC voted to accept the settlement, with new rates effective January 2, 2021. Piedmont must refund customers the difference between bills previously rendered under interim rates and such bills if rendered under approved rates, plus interest.\n2021 North Carolina Rate Case\nOn February 19, 2021, Piedmont filed notice with the NCUC of its intent to file a general rate case on or about March 22, 2021. Piedmont\u2019s last general rate case in North Carolina was filed in April 2019, with rates effective November 2019.\n2019 North Carolina Rate Case\nOn April 1, 2019, Piedmont filed an application with the NCUC, its first general rate case in North Carolina in six years. On August 13, 2019, Piedmont, the Public Staff, and two groups representing industrial customers filed an Agreement and Stipulation Settlement resolving issues in the base rate proceeding, which included a return on equity of 9.7% and a capital structure of 52% equity and 48% debt. Other major components of the Stipulation included:\n\u2022An annual increase in revenues of $109 million before consideration of riders associated with federal and state tax reform;\n\u2022A decrease through a rider mechanism of $23 million per year to return unprotected federal EDIT over a five-year period and deferred revenues related to the federal rate reduction of $37 million to be returned over one year;\n\u2022A decrease through a rider mechanism of $21 million per year related to reductions in the North Carolina state income tax rate to be returned over a three-year period;\n\u2022An overall cap on net revenue increase of $83 million. This will impact Piedmont beginning November 1, 2022, only if the company does not file another general rate case in the interim;\n\u2022Continuation of the IMR mechanism; and\n\u2022Establishment of a new deferral mechanism for certain Distribution Integrity Management Program (DIMP) operations and maintenance expenses incurred effective November 1, 2019, and thereafter.\nOn October 31, 2019, the NCUC approved the Stipulation and the revised customer rates were effective November 1, 2019.\nOTHER REGULATORY MATTERS\nAtlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC\nAtlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP pipeline) was planned to be an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia to North Carolina. Duke Energy indirectly owns a 47% interest, which is accounted for as an equity method investment through its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment.\nOn April 15, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Montana granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in Northern Plains Resource Council v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) (Northern Plains), vacating USACE\u2019s Nationwide Permit 12 (NWP 12) and remanding it to USACE for consultation under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973. In Northern Plains, the court ruled that NWP 12 was unlawful because USACE did not consult under the ESA with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and/or National Marine Fisheries Service prior to NWP 12\u2019s reissuance in 2017. Because NWP 12 has been vacated and its application enjoined, USACE currently has suspended verification of any new or pending applications under NWP 12 until further court action clarifies the situation.\nOn May 28, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a ruling that limited the NWP 12 vacatur to energy infrastructure projects. In July 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States issued an order allowing other new oil and gas pipeline projects to use the NWP 12 process pending appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; however, that did not decrease the uncertainty associated with an eventual ruling. Together, these rulings indicated that the timeline to reinstate the necessary water crossing permits for ACP would likely cause further delays and cost increases.\nOn July 5, 2020, Dominion Energy, Inc. announced a sale of substantially all of its gas transmission and storage segment assets, operations core to the ACP pipeline project.\nAs a result of the uncertainty created by the NWP 12 rulings, the potential impact on the cost and schedule for the project, the ongoing legal challenges and the risk of additional legal challenges and delays through the construction period and Dominion\u2019s decision to sell substantially all of its gas transmission and storage segment assets, Duke Energy's Board of Directors and management decided that it was not prudent to continue to invest in the project. On July 5, 2020, Duke Energy and Dominion announced the cancellation of the ACP pipeline project.\nAs a result, Duke Energy recorded pretax charges to earnings of approximately $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, within Equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on the Duke Energy Consolidated Statements of Operations. The tax benefit associated with this cancellation was $393 million and is recorded in Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Expense on the Duke Energy Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additional charges of less than $20 million are expected to be recorded within the next three years as ACP incurs obligations to exit operations.\nAs part of the pretax charges to earnings of approximately $2.1 billion, Duke Energy has liabilities related to the cancellation of the ACP pipeline project of $928 million and $8 million within Other Current Liabilities and Other Noncurrent Liabilities, respectively, in the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment. The liability represents Duke Energy's obligation of approximately $860 million to fund ACP's outstanding debt and $76 million to satisfy remaining ARO requirements to restore construction sites.\nSee Notes 7 and 12 for additional information regarding this transaction.\nPotential Coal Plant Retirements\nThe Subsidiary Registrants periodically file integrated resource plans (IRPs) with their state regulatory commissions. The IRPs provide a view of forecasted energy needs over a long term (10 to 20 years) and options being considered to meet those needs. IRPs filed by the Subsidiary Registrants included planning assumptions to potentially retire certain coal-fired generating facilities in North Carolina and Indiana earlier than their current estimated useful lives. Duke Energy continues to evaluate the potential need to retire these coal-fired generating facilities earlier than the current estimated useful lives and plans to seek regulatory recovery for amounts that would not be otherwise recovered when any of these assets are retired.\nThe table below contains the net carrying value of generating facilities planned for retirement or included in recent IRPs as evaluated for potential retirement. Dollar amounts in the table below are included in Net property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020, and exclude capitalized asset retirement costs.\n(a) As part of the 2015 resolution of a lawsuit involving alleged New Source Review violations, Duke Energy Carolinas must retire Allen Steam Station Units 1 through 3 by December 31, 2024. The long-term energy options considered in the IRP could result in retirement of these units earlier than their current estimated useful lives. Unit 3 with a capacity of 270 MW and a net book value of $26 million at December 31, 2020, is expected to be retired in March 2021.\n(b) These units are included in the IRP filed by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress in North Carolina and South Carolina on September 1, 2020. The long-term energy options considered in the IRP could result in retirement of these units earlier than their current estimated useful lives. In 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed North Carolina rate cases that included depreciation studies that accelerate end-of-life dates for these plants. A decision by NCUC is expected by the end of the first quarter 2021.\n(c) On January 14, 2021, Duke Energy Florida filed a settlement agreement with the FPSC, which proposed depreciation rates reflecting retirement dates for Duke Energy Florida's last two coal-fired generating facilities, Crystal River Units 4-5, eight years ahead of schedule in 2034 rather than in 2042, in support of Duke Energy's carbon reduction goals. A request for the FPSC to hold a hearing has been made and a decision by the FPSC is expected in the second quarter 2021.\n(d) Duke Energy Indiana committed to either retire or stop burning coal at Gallagher Units 2 and 4 by December 31, 2022, as part of the 2016 settlement of Edwardsport IGCC matters. In February 2021, upon approval by MISO of a new retirement date, Duke Energy Indiana determined it would modify the retirement date to June 1, 2021.\n(e) On July 1, 2019, Duke Energy Indiana filed its 2018 IRP with the IURC. The 2018 IRP included scenarios evaluating the potential retirement of coal-fired generating units at Gibson and Cayuga. The rate case filed July 2, 2019, included proposed depreciation rates reflecting retirement dates from 2026 to 2038. The depreciation rates reflecting these updated retirement dates were approved by the IURC as part of the rate case order issued on June 29, 2020.\n4. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nINSURANCE\nGeneral Insurance\nThe Duke Energy Registrants have insurance and reinsurance coverage either directly or through indemnification from Duke Energy\u2019s captive insurance company, Bison, and its affiliates, consistent with companies engaged in similar commercial operations with similar type properties. The Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 coverage includes (i) commercial general liability coverage for liabilities arising to third parties for bodily injury and property damage; (ii) workers\u2019 compensation; (iii) automobile liability coverage; and (iv) property coverage for all real and personal property damage. Real and personal property damage coverage excludes electric transmission and distribution lines, but includes damages arising from boiler and machinery breakdowns, earthquakes, flood damage and extra expense, but not outage or replacement power coverage. All coverage is subject to certain deductibles or retentions, sublimits, exclusions, terms and conditions common for companies with similar types of operations. The Duke Energy Registrants self-insure their electric transmission and distribution lines against loss due to storm damage and other natural disasters. As discussed further in Note 3, Duke Energy Florida maintains a storm damage reserve and has a regulatory mechanism to recover the cost of named storms on an expedited basis.\nThe cost of the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 coverage can fluctuate from year to year reflecting claims history and conditions of the insurance and reinsurance markets.\nIn the event of a loss, terms and amounts of insurance and reinsurance available might not be adequate to cover claims and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered by other sources, could have a material effect on the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Each company is responsible to the extent losses may be excluded or exceed limits of the coverage available.\nNuclear Insurance\nDuke Energy Carolinas owns and operates McGuire and Oconee and operates and has a partial ownership interest in Catawba. McGuire and Catawba each have two reactors. Oconee has three reactors. The other joint owners of Catawba reimburse Duke Energy Carolinas for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance per the Catawba joint owner agreements.\nDuke Energy Progress owns and operates Robinson, Brunswick and Harris. Robinson and Harris each have one reactor. Brunswick has two reactors.\nDuke Energy Florida owns Crystal River Unit 3, which permanently ceased operation in 2013 and reached a SAFSTOR condition in January 2018 after the successful transfer of all used nuclear fuel assemblies to an on-site dry cask storage facility.\nIn the event of a loss, terms and amounts of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered by other sources, could have a material effect on Duke Energy Carolinas\u2019, Duke Energy Progress\u2019 and Duke Energy Florida\u2019s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Each company is responsible to the extent losses may be excluded or exceed limits of the coverage available.\nNuclear Liability Coverage\nThe Price-Anderson Act requires owners of nuclear reactors to provide for public nuclear liability protection per nuclear incident up to a maximum total financial protection liability. The maximum total financial protection liability, which is approximately $13.8 billion, is subject to change every five years for inflation and for the number of licensed reactors. Total nuclear liability coverage consists of a combination of private primary nuclear liability insurance coverage and a mandatory industry risk-sharing program to provide for excess nuclear liability coverage above the maximum reasonably available private primary coverage. The U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims.\nPrimary Liability Insurance\nDuke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have purchased the maximum reasonably available private primary nuclear liability insurance as required by law, which is $450 million per station. Duke Energy Florida has purchased $100 million primary nuclear liability insurance in compliance with the law.\nExcess Liability Program\nThis program provides $13.3 billion of coverage per incident through the Price-Anderson Act\u2019s mandatory industry-wide excess secondary financial protection program of risk pooling. This amount is the product of potential cumulative retrospective premium assessments of $138 million times the current 97 licensed commercial nuclear reactors in the U.S. Under this program, licensees could be assessed retrospective premiums to compensate for public nuclear liability damages in the event of a nuclear incident at any licensed facility in the U.S. Retrospective premiums may be assessed at a rate not to exceed $20.5 million per year per licensed reactor for each incident. The assessment may be subject to state premium taxes.\nNuclear Property and Accidental Outage Coverage\nDuke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), an industry mutual insurance company, which provides property damage, nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning insurance for each station for losses resulting from damage to its nuclear plants, either due to accidents or acts of terrorism. Additionally, NEIL provides accidental outage coverage for losses in the event of a major accidental outage at an insured nuclear station.\nPursuant to regulations of the NRC, each company\u2019s property damage insurance policies provide that all proceeds from such insurance be applied, first, to place the plant in a safe and stable condition after a qualifying accident and second, to decontaminate the plant before any proceeds can be used for decommissioning, plant repair or restoration.\nLosses resulting from acts of terrorism are covered as common occurrences, such that if terrorist acts occur against one or more commercial nuclear power plants insured by NEIL within a 12-month period, they would be treated as one event and the owners of the plants where the act occurred would share one full limit of liability. The full limit of liability is currently $3.2 billion. NEIL sublimits the total aggregate for all of their policies for non-nuclear terrorist events to approximately $1.8 billion.\nEach nuclear facility has accident property damage, nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning liability insurance from NEIL with limits of $1.5 billion, except for Crystal River Unit 3. Crystal River Unit 3\u2019s limit is $50 million and is on an actual cash value basis. All nuclear facilities except for Catawba and Crystal River Unit 3 also share an additional $1.25 billion nuclear accident insurance limit above their dedicated underlying limit. This shared additional excess limit is not subject to reinstatement in the event of a loss. Catawba has a dedicated $1.25 billion of additional nuclear accident insurance limit above its dedicated underlying limit. Catawba and Oconee also have an additional $750 million of non-nuclear accident property damage limit. All coverages are subject to sublimits and significant deductibles.\nNEIL\u2019s Accidental Outage policy provides some coverage, similar to business interruption, for losses in the event of a major accident property damage outage of a nuclear unit. Coverage is provided on a weekly limit basis after a significant waiting period deductible and at 100% of the applicable weekly limits for 52 weeks and 80% of the applicable weekly limits for up to the next 110 weeks. Coverage is provided until these applicable weekly periods are met, where the accidental outage policy limit will not exceed $490 million for McGuire and Catawba, $434 million for Harris, $420 million for Brunswick, $392 million for Oconee and $336 million for Robinson. NEIL sublimits the accidental outage recovery up to the first 104 weeks of coverage not to exceed $328 million from non-nuclear accidental property damage. Coverage amounts decrease in the event more than one unit at a station is out of service due to a common accident. All coverages are subject to sublimits and significant deductibles.\nPotential Retroactive Premium Assessments\nIn the event of NEIL losses, NEIL\u2019s board of directors may assess member companies' retroactive premiums of amounts up to 10 times their annual premiums for up to six years after a loss. NEIL has never exercised this assessment. The maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligations for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are $156 million, $93 million and $1 million, respectively. Duke Energy Carolinas' maximum assessment amount includes 100% of potential obligations to NEIL for jointly owned reactors. Duke Energy Carolinas would seek reimbursement from the joint owners for their portion of these assessment amounts.\nENVIRONMENTAL\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local laws regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, coal ash and other environmental matters. These laws can be changed from time to time, imposing new obligations on the Duke Energy Registrants. The following environmental matters impact all of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nRemediation Activities\nIn addition to the ARO recorded as a result of various environmental regulations, discussed in Note 9, the Duke Energy Registrants are responsible for environmental remediation at various sites. These include certain properties that are part of ongoing operations and sites formerly owned or used by Duke Energy entities. These sites are in various stages of investigation, remediation and monitoring. Managed in conjunction with relevant federal, state and local agencies, remediation activities vary based upon site conditions and location, remediation requirements, complexity and sharing of responsibility. If remediation activities involve joint and several liability provisions, strict liability, or cost recovery or contribution actions, the Duke Energy Registrants could potentially be held responsible for environmental impacts caused by other potentially responsible parties and may also benefit from insurance policies or contractual indemnities that cover some or all cleanup costs. Liabilities are recorded when losses become probable and are reasonably estimable. The total costs that may be incurred cannot be estimated because the extent of environmental impact, allocation among potentially responsible parties, remediation alternatives and/or regulatory decisions have not yet been determined at all sites. Additional costs associated with remediation activities are likely to be incurred in the future and could be significant. Costs are typically expensed as Operation, maintenance and other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations unless regulatory recovery of the costs is deemed probable.\nThe following tables contain information regarding reserves for probable and estimable costs related to the various environmental sites. These reserves are recorded in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAdditional losses in excess of recorded reserves that could be incurred for the stages of investigation, remediation and monitoring for environmental sites that have been evaluated at this time are not material except as presented in the table below.\nLITIGATION\nDuke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress\nCoal Ash Insurance Coverage Litigation\nIn March 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed a civil action in the North Carolina Business Court against various insurance providers. The lawsuit seeks payment for coal ash related liabilities covered by third-party liability insurance policies. The insurance policies were issued between 1971 and 1986 and provide third-party liability insurance for property damage. The civil action seeks damages for breach of contract and indemnification for costs arising from the Coal Ash Act and the EPA CCR rule at 15 coal-fired plants in North Carolina and South Carolina. Fact discovery has been completed. The parties filed dispositive pretrial motions relating to key legal issues on December 4, 2020. Hearings on these motions are scheduled to begin on February 24, 2021, and trial is scheduled for January 24, 2022. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nDuke Energy Carolinas\nNTE Carolinas II, LLC Litigation\nIn November 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas entered into a standard FERC large generator interconnection agreement (LGIA) with NTE Carolinas II, LLC (NTE), a company that proposed to build a combined-cycle natural gas plant in Rockingham County, North Carolina. On September 6, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a lawsuit in Mecklenburg County Superior Court against NTE for breach of contract and alleging that NTE's failure to pay benchmark payments for Duke Energy Carolinas' transmission system upgrades required under the interconnection agreement constituted a termination of the interconnection agreement. Duke Energy Carolinas is seeking a monetary judgment against NTE because NTE failed to make multiple milestone payments. The lawsuit was moved to federal court in North Carolina. NTE filed a motion to dismiss Duke Energy Carolinas\u2019 complaint and brought counterclaims alleging anti-competitive conduct and violations of state and federal statutes. Duke Energy Carolinas filed a motion to dismiss NTE's counterclaims.\nOn May 21, 2020, in response to a NTE petition challenging Duke Energy Carolina's termination of the LGIA, FERC issued a ruling (i) that it has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a transmission provider may terminate a LGIA, (ii) FERC approval is required to terminate a conforming LGIA if objected to by the interconnection customer, and (iii) Duke Energy may not announce the termination of a conforming LGIA unless FERC has approved the termination.\nOn August 17, 2020, the court denied both NTE\u2019s and Duke Energy Carolinas\u2019 Motion to Dismiss. The parties are in active discovery and trial is scheduled for June 20, 2022. Duke Energy Carolinas cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nAsbestos-related Injuries and Damages Claims\nDuke Energy Carolinas has experienced numerous claims for indemnification and medical cost reimbursement related to asbestos exposure. These claims relate to damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen from exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with construction and maintenance activities conducted on its electric generation plants prior to 1985. As of December 31, 2020, there were 145 asserted claims for non-malignant cases with the cumulative relief sought of up to $39 million and 56 asserted claims for malignant cases with the cumulative relief sought of up to $20 million. Based on Duke Energy Carolinas\u2019 experience, it is expected that the ultimate resolution of most of these claims likely will be less than the amount claimed.\nDuke Energy Carolinas has recognized asbestos-related reserves of $572 million and $604 million at December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. These reserves are classified in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities and Other within Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These reserves are based upon Duke Energy Carolinas' best estimate for current and future asbestos claims through 2040 and are recorded on an undiscounted basis. In light of the uncertainties inherent in a longer-term forecast, management does not believe they can reasonably estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred after 2040 related to such potential claims. It is possible Duke Energy Carolinas may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of the recorded reserves.\nDuke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention. Duke Energy Carolinas\u2019 cumulative payments began to exceed the self-insurance retention in 2008. Future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by the third-party insurance carrier. The insurance policy limit for potential future insurance recoveries indemnification and medical cost claim payments is $714 million in excess of the self-insured retention. Receivables for insurance recoveries were $704 million and $742 million at December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. These amounts are classified in Other within Other Noncurrent Assets and Receivables within Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Duke Energy Carolinas is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims. Duke Energy Carolinas believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating.\nAs described in Note 1, Duke Energy adopted the new guidance for credit losses effective January 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective method of adoption, which does not require restatement of prior year reported results. The reserve for credit losses for insurance receivables for the asbestos-related injuries and damages based on adoption of the new standard is $15 million for Duke Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas as of December 31, 2020. The insurance receivable is evaluated based on the risk of default and the historical losses, current conditions and expected conditions around collectability. Management evaluates the risk of default annually based on payment history, credit rating and changes in the risk of default from credit agencies.\nDuke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida\nSpent Nuclear Fuel Matters\nOn June 18, 2018, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida sued the U.S. in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for damages incurred for the period 2014 through 2018. The lawsuit claimed the Department of Energy breached a contract in failing to accept spent nuclear fuel under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and asserted damages for the cost of on-site storage in the amount of $100 million and $200 million for Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, respectively. Discovery is ongoing and a trial is expected to occur in 2021.\nDuke Energy Florida\nPower Purchase Dispute Arbitration\nDuke Energy Florida, on behalf of its customers, entered into a PPA for the purchase of firm capacity and energy from a qualifying facility under the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. Duke Energy Florida determined the qualifying facility did not perform in accordance with the PPA, and Duke Energy Florida terminated the PPA. The qualifying facility counterparty filed a confidential American Arbitration Association (AAA) arbitration demand, challenging the termination of the PPA and seeking damages. Duke Energy Florida denies liability and is vigorously defending the arbitration claim.\nThe final arbitration hearing occurred during the week of December 7, 2020. An arbitral award has not yet been issued. Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nDuke Energy Indiana\nCoal Ash Basin Closure Plan Appeal\nOn January 27, 2020, Hoosier Environmental Council filed a Petition for Administrative Review with the Indiana Office of Environmental Adjudication (the court) challenging the Indiana Department of Environmental Management\u2019s December 10, 2019, partial approval of Duke Energy Indiana\u2019s ash pond closure plan. On March 11, 2020, Duke Energy Indiana filed a Motion to Dismiss. On May 5, 2020, the court denied the motion. The parties have completed discovery and will now prepare to file dispositive motions. Summary judgment briefing will be completed by March 30, 2021. If these claims survive dispositive motions, a hearing is scheduled for April 26, 2021. Duke Energy Indiana cannot predict the outcome of this matter. See Note 9 for additional information.\nOther Litigation and Legal Proceedings\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are involved in other legal, tax and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which involve significant amounts. The Duke Energy Registrants believe the final disposition of these proceedings will not have a material effect on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nThe table below presents recorded reserves based on management\u2019s best estimate of probable loss for legal matters, excluding asbestos-related reserves. Reserves are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities and Other within Current Liabilities. The reasonably possible range of loss in excess of recorded reserves is not material, other than as described above.\nOTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nGeneral\nAs part of their normal business, the Duke Energy Registrants are party to various financial guarantees, performance guarantees and other contractual commitments to extend guarantees of credit and other assistance to various subsidiaries, investees and other third parties. These guarantees involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not fully recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and have uncapped maximum potential payments. See Note 7 for more information.\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchased Power\nDuke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Ohio have ongoing purchased power contracts, including renewable energy contracts, with other utilities, wholesale marketers, co-generators and qualified facilities. These purchased power contracts generally provide for capacity and energy payments. In addition, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have various contracts to secure transmission rights.\nThe following table presents executory purchased power contracts with terms exceeding one year, excluding contracts classified as leases.\n(a) Contracts represent either 100% of net plant output or vary.\n(b) Contracts represent 100% of net plant output.\n(c) Contracts represent between 1% and 11% of net plant output.\n(d) Excludes PPA with OVEC. See Note 17 for additional information.\nGas Supply and Capacity Contracts\nDuke Energy Ohio and Piedmont routinely enter into long-term natural gas supply commodity and capacity commitments and other agreements that commit future cash flows to acquire services needed in their businesses. These commitments include pipeline and storage capacity contracts and natural gas supply contracts to provide service to customers. Costs arising from the natural gas supply commodity and capacity commitments, while significant, are pass-through costs to customers and are generally fully recoverable through the fuel adjustment or PGA procedures and prudence reviews in North Carolina and South Carolina and under the Tennessee Incentive Plan in Tennessee. In the Midwest, these costs are recovered via the Gas Cost Recovery Rate in Ohio or the Gas Cost Adjustment Clause in Kentucky. The time periods for fixed payments under pipeline and storage capacity contracts are up to 15 years. The time periods for fixed payments under natural gas supply contracts are up to six years. The time period for the natural gas supply purchase commitments is up to 11 years.\nCertain storage and pipeline capacity contracts require the payment of demand charges that are based on rates approved by the FERC in order to maintain rights to access the natural gas storage or pipeline capacity on a firm basis during the contract term. The demand charges that are incurred in each period are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as part of natural gas purchases and are included in Cost of natural gas.\nThe following table presents future unconditional purchase obligations under natural gas supply and capacity contracts as of December 31, 2020.\n5. LEASES\nAs part of its operations, Duke Energy leases certain aircraft, space on communication towers, industrial equipment, fleet vehicles, fuel transportation (barges and railcars), land and office space under various terms and expiration dates. Additionally, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Indiana have finance leases related to firm natural gas pipeline transportation capacity. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have entered into certain PPAs, which are classified as finance and operating leases.\nDuke Energy has certain lease agreements, which include variable lease payments that are based on the usage of an asset. These variable lease payments are not included in the measurement of the ROU assets or operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCertain Duke Energy lease agreements include options for renewal and early termination. The intent to renew a lease varies depending on the lease type and asset. Renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised are included in the lease measurements. The decision to terminate a lease early is dependent on various economic factors. No termination options have been included in any of the lease measurements.\nDuke Energy Carolinas entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement in December 2019, to construct and occupy an office tower. The lease agreement was evaluated as a sale-leaseback of real estate and it was determined that the transaction did not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting. As a result, the transaction is being accounted for as a financing. For this transaction, Duke Energy Carolinas will continue to record the real estate on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Property, Plant and Equipment as if it were the legal owner and will continue to recognize depreciation expense over the estimated useful life. In addition, a liability will be recorded for the failed sale-leaseback obligation within Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the monthly lease payments commencing after the construction phase being split between interest expense and principal pay down of the debt.\nDuke Energy operates various renewable energy projects and sells the generated output to utilities, electric cooperatives, municipalities and commercial and industrial customers through long-term PPAs. In certain situations, these PPAs and the associated renewable energy projects qualify as operating leases. Rental income from these leases is accounted for as Nonregulated electric and other revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There are no minimum lease payments as all payments are contingent based on actual electricity generated by the renewable energy projects. Contingent lease payments were $275 million, $264 million and $268 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Renewable energy projects owned by Duke Energy and accounted for as operating leases had a cost basis of $3,335 million and $3,349 million and accumulated depreciation of $848 million and $721 million at December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. These assets are principally classified as nonregulated electric generation and transmission assets.\nPiedmont has certain agreements with Duke Energy Carolinas for the construction and transportation of natural gas pipelines to supply its natural gas plant needs. Piedmont accounts for these pipeline lateral contracts as sales-type leases since the present value of the sum of the lease payments equals the fair value of the assets. These pipeline lateral assets owned by Piedmont had a current net investment basis of $2 million and $4 million as of December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively, and a long-term net investment basis of $205 million and $70 million as of December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. These assets are classified in Other, within Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets, respectively, on Piedmont's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Duke Energy Carolinas accounts for the contracts as finance leases. The activity for these contracts is eliminated in consolidation at Duke Energy.\nThe following tables present the components of lease expense.\n(a) Included in Operations, maintenance and other or, for barges and railcars, Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(b) Included in Depreciation and amortization on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(c) Included in Interest Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(a) Included in Operations, maintenance and other or, for barges and railcars, Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(b) Included in Depreciation and amortization on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(c) Included in Interest Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table presents rental expense for operating leases, as reported under the former lease standard. These amounts are included in Operation, maintenance and other and Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table presents operating lease maturities and a reconciliation of the undiscounted cash flows to operating lease liabilities.\n(a) Certain operating lease payments include renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised.\nThe following table presents finance lease maturities and a reconciliation of the undiscounted cash flows to finance lease liabilities.\nThe following tables contain additional information related to leases.\n(a) No amounts were classified as investing cash flows from operating leases for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(b) Does not include ROU assets recorded as a result of the adoption of the new lease standard.\n(a) No amounts were classified as investing cash flows from operating leases for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(b) Does not include ROU assets recorded as a result of the adoption of the new lease standard.\n(a) The discount rate is calculated using the rate implicit in a lease if it is readily determinable. Generally, the rate used by the lessor is not provided to Duke Energy and in these cases the incremental borrowing rate is used. Duke Energy will typically use its fully collateralized incremental borrowing rate as of the commencement date to calculate and record the lease. The incremental borrowing rate is influenced by the lessee\u2019s credit rating and lease term and as such may differ for individual leases, embedded leases or portfolios of leased assets.\n(a) The discount rate is calculated using the rate implicit in a lease if it is readily determinable.

The weighted average days to maturity for Duke Energy's commercial paper programs was 14 days.\n(e) Duke Energy includes $1,275 million and $137 million in purchase accounting adjustments related to Progress Energy and Piedmont, respectively.\n(f) Duke Energy includes $37 million in purchase accounting adjustments primarily related to the merger with Progress Energy.\n(g) Refer to Note 17 for additional information on amounts from consolidated VIEs.\nCurrent Maturities of Long-Term Debt\nThe following table shows the significant components of Current maturities of Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Duke Energy Registrants currently anticipate satisfying these obligations with cash on hand and proceeds from additional borrowings.\n(a) During October 2020, Progress Energy early retired $500 million of unsecured debt with an original maturity of January 15, 2021.\n(b) Debt has a floating interest rate.\n(c) Includes finance lease obligations, amortizing debt and small bullet maturities.\nMaturities and Call Options\nThe following table shows the annual maturities of long-term debt for the next five years and thereafter. Amounts presented exclude short-term notes payable, commercial paper and money pool borrowings and debt issuance costs for the Subsidiary Registrants.\n(a) Excludes $1,346 million in purchase accounting adjustments related to the Progress Energy merger and the Piedmont acquisition.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants have the ability under certain debt facilities to call and repay the obligation prior to its scheduled maturity. Therefore, the actual timing of future cash repayments could be materially different than as presented above.\nShort-Term Obligations Classified as Long-Term Debt\nTax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrants at the option of the holder and certain commercial paper issuances and money pool borrowings are classified as Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These tax-exempt bonds, commercial paper issuances and money pool borrowings, which are short-term obligations by nature, are classified as long-term due to Duke Energy\u2019s intent and ability to utilize such borrowings as long-term financing. As Duke Energy\u2019s Master Credit Facility and other bilateral letter of credit agreements have non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of the balance sheet date, Duke Energy has the ability to refinance these short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The following tables show short-term obligations classified as long-term debt.\n(a) Progress Energy amounts are equal to Duke Energy Progress amounts.\nSummary of Significant Debt Issuances\nThe following tables summarize significant debt issuances (in millions).\n(a)Debt issued to repay $500 million borrowing made under Duke Energy (Parent) revolving credit facility in March 2020, and for general corporate purposes.\n(b)Debt issued to repay short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.\n(c)Debt issued to repay $700 million term loan due December 2020.\n(d)Debt issuance has a floating interest rate.\n(e)Debt issued to repay a portion of outstanding commercial paper, to repay a portion of Duke Energy (Parent)'s outstanding $1.7 billion term loan due March 2021 and for general corporate purposes.\n(f)Debt issued to repay at maturity $450 million first mortgage bonds due June 2020 and for general corporate purposes.\n(g)Debt issued to repay at maturity $500 million first mortgage bonds due July 2020 and to pay down short-term debt.\n(h)Debt issued to repay at maturity $300 million first mortgage bonds due September 2020 and for general corporate purposes.\n(a)Debt issued to pay down short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.\n(b)Debt issuance has a floating interest rate.\n(c)Debt issued to repay at maturity $450 million first mortgage bonds due April 2019, pay down short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.\n(d)Debt issued to fund eligible green energy projects in the Carolinas.\n(e)Debt issued to repay in full the outstanding $350 million Piedmont unsecured term loan due September 2019, pay down short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.\n(f)Debt issued to retire $150 million of pollution control bonds, pay down short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.\n(g)Debt issued to repay at maturity $100 million debentures due October 2019, pay down short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.\n(h)Debt issued to fund storm restoration costs and for general corporate purposes.\n(i)Debt issued to reimburse the payment of existing and new Eligible Green Expenditures in Florida.\nAVAILABLE CREDIT FACILITIES\nMaster Credit Facility\nIn March 2020, Duke Energy amended its existing $8 billion Master Credit Facility to extend the termination date to March 2025. The Duke Energy Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, have borrowing capacity under the Master Credit Facility up to a specified sublimit for each borrower. Duke Energy has the unilateral ability at any time to increase or decrease the borrowing sublimits of each borrower, subject to a maximum sublimit for each borrower. The amount available under the Master Credit Facility has been reduced to backstop issuances of commercial paper, certain letters of credit and variable-rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrants at the option of the holder.\nThe table below includes the current borrowing sublimits and available capacity under these credit facilities.\n(a) Represents the sublimit of each borrower.\n(b) Duke Energy issued $625 million of commercial paper and loaned the proceeds through the money pool to Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. The balances are classified as Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Companies in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTerm Loan Facility\nIn response to market volatility and ongoing liquidity impacts from COVID-19, in March 2020, Duke Energy (Parent) entered into a $1.5 billion, 364-day Term Loan Credit Agreement, borrowing the full $1.5 billion available on March 19, 2020. The term loan contained a provision for increasing the amount available for borrowing by up to $500 million. Duke Energy (Parent) exercised this provision on March 27, 2020, borrowing an additional $188 million. Proceeds were used to reduce outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. The loan was repaid by Duke Energy (Parent) as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 1 for additional information on the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThree-Year Revolving Credit Facility\nDuke Energy (Parent) has a $1 billion revolving credit facility. The facility had an initial termination date of June 2020, but in May 2019, Duke Energy extended the termination date of the facility to May 2022. Borrowings under this facility will be used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2020, $500 million has been drawn under this facility. This balance is classified as Long-term debt on Duke Energy's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any undrawn commitments can be drawn, and borrowings can be prepaid, at any time throughout the term of the facility. During the first quarter of 2020, an additional $500 million was drawn under this facility to manage liquidity impacts from COVID-19. The additional $500 million was paid down during the second quarter of 2020. The terms and conditions of the facility are generally consistent with those governing Duke Energy's Master Credit Facility.\nDuke Energy Progress Term Loan Facility\nIn December 2018, Duke Energy Progress entered into a two-year term loan facility with commitments totaling $700 million. Borrowings under the facility were used to pay storm-related costs, pay down commercial paper and to partially finance an upcoming bond maturity. As of December 31, 2019, the entire $700 million had been drawn under the term loan and was classified as Current maturities of long-term debt on Duke Energy Progress' Consolidated Balance Sheets. In August 2020, Duke Energy Progress repaid its $700 million two-year term loan facility.\nOther Debt Matters\nIn September 2019, Duke Energy filed a Form S-3 with the SEC. Under this Form S-3, which is uncapped, the Duke Energy Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may issue debt and other securities, including preferred stock, in the future at amounts, prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future offerings. The registration statement was filed to replace a similar prior filing upon expiration of its three-year term and also allows for the issuance of common and preferred stock by Duke Energy.\nDuke Energy has an effective Form S-3 with the SEC to sell up to $3 billion of variable denomination floating-rate demand notes, called PremierNotes. The Form S-3 states that no more than $1.5 billion of the notes will be outstanding at any particular time. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Duke Energy PremierNotes Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The interest rate payable on notes held by an investor may vary based on the principal amount of the investment. The notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Duke Energy or at the investor\u2019s option at any time. The balance as of December 31, 2020, and 2019, was $1,168 million and $1,049 million, respectively. The notes are short-term debt obligations of Duke Energy and are reflected as Notes payable and commercial paper on Duke Energy\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nMoney Pool\nThe Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, are eligible to receive support for their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. Under this arrangement, those companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating in this arrangement. The money pool is structured such that the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, separately manage their cash needs and working capital requirements. Accordingly, there is no net settlement of receivables and payables between money pool participants. Duke Energy (Parent), may loan funds to its participating subsidiaries, but may not borrow funds through the money pool. Accordingly, as the money pool activity is between Duke Energy and its wholly owned subsidiaries, all money pool balances are eliminated within Duke Energy\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nMoney pool receivable balances are reflected within Notes receivable from affiliated companies on the Subsidiary Registrants\u2019 Consolidated Balance Sheets. Money pool payable balances are reflected within either Notes payable to affiliated companies or Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Companies on the Subsidiary Registrants\u2019 Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRestrictive Debt Covenants\nThe Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Duke Energy's Master Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio not to exceed 65% for each borrower, excluding Piedmont, and 70% for Piedmont. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of December 31, 2020, each of the Duke Energy Registrants was in compliance with all covenants related to their debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses.\nOther Loans\nAs of December 31, 2020, and 2019, Duke Energy had loans outstanding of $817 million, including $35 million at Duke Energy Progress and $777 million, including $36 million at Duke Energy Progress, respectively, against the cash surrender value of life insurance policies it owns on the lives of its executives. The amounts outstanding were carried as a reduction of the related cash surrender value that is included in Other within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n7. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS\nDuke Energy has various financial and performance guarantees and indemnifications with non-consolidated entities, which are issued in the normal course of business. As discussed below, these contracts include performance guarantees, standby letters of credit, debt guarantees and indemnifications. Duke Energy enters into these arrangements to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties by enhancing the value of the transaction to the third party. At December 31, 2020, Duke Energy does not believe conditions are likely for significant performance under these guarantees, except for ACP as described below. To the extent liabilities are incurred as a result of the activities covered by the guarantees, such liabilities are included on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn January 2, 2007, Duke Energy completed the spin-off of its previously wholly owned natural gas businesses to shareholders. Guarantees issued by Duke Energy or its affiliates, or assigned to Duke Energy prior to the spin-off, remained with Duke Energy subsequent to the spin-off. Guarantees issued by Spectra Capital or its affiliates prior to the spin-off remained with Spectra Capital subsequent to the spin-off, except for guarantees that were later assigned to Duke Energy. Duke Energy has indemnified Spectra Capital against any losses incurred under certain of the guarantee obligations that remain with Spectra Capital. At December 31, 2020, the maximum potential amount of future payments associated with these guarantees were $56 million, the majority of which expires by 2028.\nIn October 2017, ACP executed a $3.4 billion revolving credit facility with a stated maturity date of October 2021. Duke Energy entered into a guarantee agreement to support its share of the ACP revolving credit facility. In July 2020, ACP reduced the size of the credit facility to $1.9 billion. Duke Energy's maximum exposure to loss under the terms of the guarantee is $860 million as of December 31, 2020. This amount represents 47% of the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility.\nDuke Energy recognized the $860 million within Other Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020, of which $95 million was previously recognized due the adoption of new guidance for credit losses effective January 1, 2020. See Notes 3 and 12 for more information. The remaining reserve for credit losses for financial guarantees of $4 million at December 31, 2020, is included within Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Duke Energy's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management considers financial guarantees for evaluation under this standard based on the anticipated amount outstanding at the time of default. The reserve for credit losses is based on the evaluation of the contingent components of financial guarantees. Management evaluates the risk of default, exposure and length of time remaining in the period for each contract.\nIn addition to the Spectra Capital and ACP revolving credit facility guarantees above, Duke Energy has issued performance guarantees to customers and other third parties that guarantee the payment and performance of other parties, including certain non-wholly owned entities, as well as guarantees of debt of certain non-consolidated entities. If such entities were to default on payments or performance, Duke Energy would be required under the guarantees to make payments on the obligations of these entities. The maximum potential amount of future payments required under these guarantees as of December 31, 2020, was $56 million of which $53 million expire between 2021 and 2030, with the remaining performance guarantees having no contractual expiration. Additionally, certain guarantees have uncapped maximum potential payments; however, Duke Energy does not believe these guarantees will have a material effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nDuke Energy uses bank-issued standby letters of credit to secure the performance of wholly owned and non-wholly owned entities to a third party or customer. Under these arrangements, Duke Energy has payment obligations to the issuing bank that are triggered by a draw by the third party or customer due to the failure of the wholly owned or non-wholly owned entity to perform according to the terms of its underlying contract. At December 31, 2020, Duke Energy had issued a total of $566 million in letters of credit, which expire between 2021 and 2023. The unused amount under these letters of credit was $76 million.\nDuke Energy recognized $11 million and $23 million as of December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively, primarily in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, for the guarantees discussed above. As current estimates change, additional losses related to guarantees and indemnifications to third parties, which could be material, may be recorded by the Duke Energy Registrants in the future.\n8. JOINT OWNERSHIP OF GENERATING AND TRANSMISSION FACILITIES\nThe Duke Energy Registrants maintain ownership interests in certain jointly owned generating and transmission facilities. The Duke Energy Registrants are entitled to a share of the generating capacity and output of each unit equal to their respective ownership interests. The Duke Energy Registrants pay their ownership share of additional construction costs, fuel inventory purchases and operating expenses. The Duke Energy Registrants share of revenues and operating costs of the jointly owned facilities is included within the corresponding line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Each participant in the jointly owned facilities must provide its own financing.\nThe following table presents the Duke Energy Registrants' interest of jointly owned plant or facilities and amounts included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All facilities are operated by the Duke Energy Registrants and are included in the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure segment.\n(a) Jointly owned with North Carolina Municipal Power Agency Number 1, NCEMC and PMPA.\n(b) Jointly owned with NCEMC.\n(c) Jointly owned with WVPA and IMPA.\n(d) Jointly owned with WVPA.\n9. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nDuke Energy records an ARO when it has a legal obligation to incur retirement costs associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Certain assets of the Duke Energy Registrants have an indeterminate life, such as transmission and distribution facilities, and thus the fair value of the retirement obligation is not reasonably estimable. A liability for these AROs will be recorded when a fair value is determinable.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 regulated operations accrue costs of removal for property that does not have an associated legal retirement obligation based on regulatory orders from state commissions. These costs of removal are recorded as a regulatory liability in accordance with regulatory accounting treatment. The Duke Energy Registrants do not accrue the estimated cost of removal for any nonregulated assets. See Note 3 for the estimated cost of removal for assets without an associated legal retirement obligation, which are included in Regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table presents the AROs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(a) Duke Energy amount includes purchase accounting adjustments related to the merger with Progress Energy.\nNuclear Decommissioning Liability\nAROs related to nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. The NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC require updated cost estimates for decommissioning nuclear plants every five years.\nThe following table summarizes information about the most recent site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies. Decommissioning costs are stated in 2018 or 2019 dollars, depending on the year of the cost study, and include costs to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination.\n(a) Amounts for Progress Energy equal the sum of Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida.\n(b) Decommissioning cost for Duke Energy Carolinas reflects its ownership interest in jointly owned reactors. Other joint owners are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their interest in the reactors.\n(c) Duke Energy Carolinas' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost study completed in 2018 was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in 2019. A new funding study was also completed and filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in 2019.\n(d) Duke Energy Progress' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost study completed in 2019 was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in March 2020. Duke Energy Progress also completed a funding study, which was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in July 2020.\n(e) During 2019, Duke Energy Florida reached an agreement to transfer decommissioning work for Crystal River Unit 3 to a third party and decommissioning costs are based on the agreement with this third party rather than a cost study. Regulatory approval was received from the NRC and the FPSC in April 2020 and August 2020, respectively. See Note 3 for more information.\nNuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds\nDuke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida each maintain NDTFs that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of their respective nuclear power plants. The NDTF investments are managed and invested in accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies including the NRC, FERC, NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and the IRS.\nUse of the NDTF investments is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities including license termination, spent fuel and site restoration. The license termination and spent fuel obligations relate to contaminated decommissioning and are recorded as AROs. The site restoration obligation relates to non-contaminated decommissioning and is recorded to cost of removal within Regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table presents the fair value of NDTF assets legally restricted for purposes of settling AROs associated with nuclear decommissioning. Duke Energy Florida entered into an agreement with a third party to decommission Crystal River Unit 3 and was granted an exemption from the NRC, which allows for use of the NDTF for all aspects of nuclear decommissioning. The entire balance of Duke Energy Florida's NDTF may be applied toward license termination, spent fuel and site restoration costs incurred to decommission Crystal River Unit 3 and is excluded from the table below. See Note 16 for additional information related to the fair value of the Duke Energy Registrants' NDTFs.\nNuclear Operating Licenses\nOperating licenses for nuclear units are potentially subject to extension. The following table includes the current expiration of nuclear operating licenses.\nThe NRC has acknowledged permanent cessation of operation and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel at Crystal River Unit 3. Therefore, the license no longer authorizes operation of the reactor. During 2019, Duke Energy Florida entered into an agreement for the accelerated decommissioning of Crystal River Unit 3. Regulatory approval was received from the NRC and the FPSC in April 2020 and August 2020, respectively. See Note 3 for more information.\nClosure of Ash Impoundments\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to state and federal regulations covering the closure of coal ash impoundments, including the EPA CCR rule and the Coal Ash Act, and other agreements. AROs recorded on the Duke Energy Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of these regulations and agreements.\nThe ARO amount recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is based upon estimated closure costs for impacted ash impoundments. The amount recorded represents the discounted cash flows for estimated closure costs based upon specific closure plans. Actual costs to be incurred will be dependent upon factors that vary from site to site. The most significant factors are the method and time frame of closure at the individual sites. Closure methods considered include removing the water from ash basins, consolidating material as necessary and capping the ash with a synthetic barrier, excavating and relocating the ash to a lined structural fill or lined landfill or recycling the ash for concrete or some other beneficial use. The ultimate method and timetable for closure will be in compliance with standards set by federal and state regulations and other agreements. The ARO amount will be adjusted as additional information is gained through the closure and post-closure process, including acceptance and approval of compliance approaches, which may change management assumptions, and may result in a material change to the balance. See ARO Liability Rollforward section below for information on revisions made to the coal ash liability during 2020 and 2019.\nAsset retirement costs associated with the AROs for operating plants and retired plants are included in Net property, plant and equipment and Regulatory assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 3 for additional information on Regulatory assets related to AROs.\nCost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy\u2019s regulated operations. See Note 3 for additional information on recovery of coal ash costs.\nARO Liability Rollforward\nThe following tables present changes in the liability associated with AROs.\n(a) Substantially all accretion expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, relates to Duke Energy\u2019s regulated operations and has been deferred in accordance with regulatory accounting treatment.\n(b) Amounts primarily relate to ash impoundment closures and nuclear decommissioning.\n(c) Amounts primarily relate to increases in closure estimates for certain ash impoundments as a result of the NCDEQ's April 1, 2019, Order and the related settlement agreement dated December 31, 2019.\n(d) Primarily relates to decreases due to revised basin closure cost estimates, partially offset by increases related to new closure plan approvals, post closure maintenance and beneficiation costs. Duke Energy Indiana estimates also include the impacts of closure estimates for certain ash impoundments due to the impact of Hoosier Environmental Council\u2019s petition filed with the court challenging the Indiana Department of Environmental Management\u2019s partial approval of Duke Energy Indiana\u2019s ash pond closure plan. See Note 4 for more information on Hoosier Environmental Council's petition. The incremental amount recorded represents the discounted cash flows for estimated closure costs based upon the probability weightings of the potential closure methods as evaluated on a site-by-site basis.\n10. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nThe following tables summarize the property, plant and equipment for Duke Energy and its subsidiary registrants.\n(a) Includes finance leases of $832 million, $335 million, $416 million, $297 million, $119 million and $10 million at Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana, respectively, primarily within Plant - Regulated. The Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida amounts are net of $141 million, $24 million and $117 million, respectively, of accumulated amortization of finance leases.\n(b) Includes $1,832 million, $1,010 million, $822 million and $822 million of accumulated amortization of nuclear fuel at Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Progress, respectively.\n(c) Includes accumulated amortization of finance leases of $12 million, $23 million and $3 million at Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Indiana, respectively.\n(d) Includes accumulated amortization of finance leases of $23 million at Duke Energy.\n(e) Includes gross property, plant and equipment cost of consolidated VIEs of $6,394 million and accumulated depreciation of consolidated VIEs of $1,242 million at Duke Energy.\nIn 2020, Duke Energy evaluated recoverability of its renewable merchant plants principally located in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas West market and in the PJM West market due to declining market pricing and declining long-term forecasted energy prices, primarily driven by lower forecasted natural gas prices. Duke Energy determined that the assets were not impaired because the carrying value of $210 million approximates the aggregate estimated future undiscounted cash flows. A continued decline in energy market pricing would likely result in a future impairment. Duke Energy retained 51% ownership interest in these facilities following the 2019 transaction to sell a minority interest in certain renewable assets. See Note 1 for further information.\n(a) Includes finance leases of $952 million, $211 million, $443 million, $308 million, $135 million, and $10 million at Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana, respectively, primarily within Plant - Regulated. The Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida amounts are net of $143 million, $17 million and $126 million, respectively, of accumulated amortization of finance leases.\n(b) Includes $1,807 million, $1,082 million, $725 million and $725 million of accumulated amortization of nuclear fuel at Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Progress, respectively.\n(c) Includes accumulated amortization of finance leases of $6 million, $13 million, and $3 million at Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Indiana, respectively.\n(d) Includes accumulated amortization of finance leases of $20 million at Duke Energy.\n(e) Includes gross property, plant and equipment cost of consolidated VIEs of $5,747 million and accumulated depreciation of consolidated VIEs of $1,041 million at Duke Energy.\nThe following tables present capitalized interest, which includes the debt component of AFUDC.\n11. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGOODWILL\nDuke Energy\nThe following table presents goodwill by reportable segment for Duke Energy included on Duke Energy's Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020, and 2019.\n(a) Duke Energy evaluated the recoverability of goodwill during 2018 and 2017 and recorded impairment charges of $93 million and $29 million, respectively, related to the Commercial Renewables reporting unit included in Impairment charges on Duke Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on the income approach and market approach in 2018 and 2017, respectively. See \"Goodwill Impairment Testing\" below for the results of the 2020 goodwill impairment test.\nDuke Energy Ohio\nDuke Energy Ohio's Goodwill balance of $920 million, allocated $596 million to Electric Utilities and Infrastructure and $324 million to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, is presented net of accumulated impairment charges of $216 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020, and 2019.\nProgress Energy\nProgress Energy's Goodwill is included in the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure segment and there are no accumulated impairment charges.\nPiedmont\nPiedmont's Goodwill is included in the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment and there are no accumulated impairment charges.\nGoodwill Impairment Testing\nDuke Energy, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont are required to perform an annual goodwill impairment test as of the same date each year and, accordingly, perform their annual impairment testing of goodwill as of August 31. Duke Energy, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont update their test between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. As the fair value for Duke Energy, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont exceeded their respective carrying values at the date of the annual impairment analysis, no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2020.\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe following tables show the carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets included in Other within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Duke Energy Registrants at December 31, 2020, and 2019.\nAmortization Expense\nAmortization expense amounts for natural gas, coal and power contracts, renewable operating projects and other intangible assets are immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, and are expected to be immaterial for the next five years as of December 31, 2020.\n12. INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES\nEQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\nInvestments in affiliates that are not controlled by Duke Energy, but over which it has significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method.\nThe following table presents Duke Energy\u2019s investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method, as well as the respective equity in earnings, by segment.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, Duke Energy received distributions from equity investments of $37 million, $55 million and $108 million, respectively, which are included in Other assets within Cash Flows from Operating Activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, Duke Energy received distributions from equity investments of $133 million, $11 million and $137 million, respectively, which are included in Return of investment capital within Cash Flows from Investing Activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, Piedmont received distributions from equity investments of $2 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively, which are included in Other assets within Cash Flows from Operating Activities and $2 million, $4 million and $3 million, respectively, which are included within Cash Flows from Investing Activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nSignificant investments in affiliates accounted for under the equity method are discussed below.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure\nDuke Energy owns 50% interests in both DATC and Pioneer, which build, own and operate electric transmission facilities in North America.\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure\nThe table below outlines Duke Energy's ownership interests in natural gas pipeline companies and natural gas storage facilities.\n(a) Duke Energy recorded OTTIs of $25 million and $55 million within Equity in (losses) earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on Duke Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively, to completely impair its 24% ownership interest in Constitution.\n(b) In 2020, Duke Energy determined it would no longer continue its investment in the construction of the ACP pipeline. See Notes 3 and 7 for further information.\n(c) Piedmont owns the Cardinal, Pine Needle and Hardy Storage investments.\n(d) Duke Energy includes purchase accounting adjustments related to Piedmont.\nCommercial Renewables\nDS Cornerstone, LLC, which owns wind farm projects in the U.S. was part of a sale of minority interest in a certain portion of renewable assets in 2019. See Note 1 for more information on the sale. Prior to the sale, Duke Energy had a 50% interest in DS Cornerstone, LLC. After the sale, Duke Energy has a 26% interest in the investment.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Duke Energy completed its acquisition of 70 distributed fuel cell projects from Bloom Energy Corporation, which approximates 43 MW of capacity serving commercial and industrial customers across the U.S. Duke Energy is not the primary beneficiary of the distributed fuel cell portfolio and does not consolidate these assets.\nOther\nDuke Energy has a 17.5% indirect economic ownership interest and 25% board representation and voting rights interest in NMC, which owns and operates a methanol and MTBE business in Jubail, Saudi Arabia.\nSignificant Subsidiaries\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Duke Energy's investment in ACP met the requirements of S-X Rule 4-08(g) to provide summarized financial information. The following table provides summary information for ACP as required under S-X Rule 1-02(bb) for the comparative periods in Duke Energy's consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations.\n13. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Subsidiary Registrants engage in related party transactions in accordance with the applicable state and federal commission regulations. Refer to the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Subsidiary Registrants for balances due to or due from related parties. Material amounts related to transactions with related parties included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income are presented in the following table.\n(a)The Subsidiary Registrants are charged their proportionate share of corporate governance and other shared services costs, primarily related to human resources, employee benefits, information technology, legal and accounting fees, as well as other third-party costs. These amounts are primarily recorded in Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n(b)The Subsidiary Registrants incur expenses related to certain indemnification coverages through Bison, Duke Energy\u2019s wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. These expenses are recorded in Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n(c)Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress participate in a JDA, which allows the collective dispatch of power plants between the service territories to reduce customer rates. Revenues from the sale of power and expenses from the purchase of power pursuant to the JDA are recorded in Operating Revenues and Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n(d)Piedmont provides long-term natural gas delivery service to certain Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress natural gas-fired generation facilities. Piedmont records the sales in Operating Revenues, and Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress record the related purchases as a component of Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power on their respective Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. These intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in consolidation.\n(e)Piedmont has related party transactions as a customer of its equity method investments in Pine Needle, Hardy Storage, and Cardinal natural gas storage and transportation facilities. These expenses are included in Cost of natural gas on Piedmont's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nIn addition to the amounts presented above, the Subsidiary Registrants have other affiliate transactions, including rental of office space, participation in a money pool arrangement, other operational transactions and their proportionate share of certain charged expenses. See Note 6 for more information regarding money pool. These transactions of the Subsidiary Registrants are incurred in the ordinary course of business and are eliminated in consolidation.\nAs discussed in Note 17, certain trade receivables have been sold by Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana to CRC, an affiliate formed by a subsidiary of Duke Energy. The proceeds obtained from the sales of receivables are largely cash but do include a subordinated note from CRC for a portion of the purchase price.\nIntercompany Income Taxes\nDuke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants file a consolidated federal income tax return and other state and jurisdictional returns. The Subsidiary Registrants have a tax sharing agreement with Duke Energy for the allocation of consolidated tax liabilities and benefits. Income taxes recorded represent amounts the Subsidiary Registrants would incur as separate C-Corporations. The following table includes the balance of intercompany income tax receivables and payables for the Subsidiary Registrants.\n14. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING\nThe Duke Energy Registrants use commodity and interest rate contracts to manage commodity price risk and interest rate risk. The primary use of commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against changes in the prices of electricity and natural gas. Piedmont enters into natural gas supply contracts to provide diversification, reliability and natural gas cost benefits to its customers. Interest rate derivatives are used to manage interest rate risk associated with borrowings.\nAll derivative instruments not identified as NPNS are recorded at fair value as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash collateral related to derivative instruments executed under master netting arrangements is offset against the collateralized derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cash impacts of settled derivatives are recorded as operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of their issuance or anticipated issuance of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Interest rate risk is managed by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring changes in interest rates. To manage risk associated with changes in interest rates, the Duke Energy Registrants may enter into interest rate swaps, U.S. Treasury lock agreements and other financial contracts. In anticipation of certain fixed-rate debt issuances, a series of forward-starting interest rate swaps or Treasury locks may be executed to lock in components of current market interest rates. These instruments are later terminated prior to or upon the issuance of the corresponding debt.\nCash Flow Hedges\nFor a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to variable cash flows of a future transaction, referred to as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings once the future transaction impacts earnings. Amounts for interest rate contracts are reclassified to earnings as interest expense over the term of the related debt. Gains and losses reclassified out of AOCI for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were not material. Duke Energy's interest rate derivatives designated as hedges include interest rate swaps used to hedge existing debt within the Commercial Renewables segment and forward-starting interest rate swaps not accounted for under regulatory accounting.\nUndesignated Contracts\nUndesignated contracts primarily include contracts not designated as a hedge because they are accounted for under regulatory accounting or contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting.\nDuke Energy\u2019s interest rate swaps for its regulated operations employ regulatory accounting. With regulatory accounting, the mark-to-market gains or losses on the swaps are deferred as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets, respectively. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized consistent with the treatment of the related costs in the ratemaking process. The accrual of interest on the swaps is recorded as Interest Expense on the Duke Energy Registrant's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nThe following tables show notional amounts of outstanding derivatives related to interest rate risk.\n(a) Duke Energy includes amounts related to consolidated VIEs of $632 million in cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2020, and $693 million in cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2019.\nCOMMODITY PRICE RISK\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to the impact of changes in the prices of electricity purchased and sold in bulk power markets and natural gas purchases, including Piedmont's natural gas supply contracts. Exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors including the term of contracts, the liquidity of markets and delivery locations. To manage risk associated with commodity prices, the Duke Energy Registrants may enter into long-term power purchase or sales contracts and long-term natural gas supply agreements.\nCash Flow Hedges\nFor derivatives designated as hedging the exposure to variable cash flows of a future transaction, referred to as a cash flow hedge, the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings once the future transaction impacts earnings. Gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were not material. Duke Energy\u2019s commodity derivatives designated as hedges include long-term electricity sales in the Commercial Renewables segment.\nUndesignated Contracts\nFor the Subsidiary Registrants, bulk power electricity and natural gas purchases flow through fuel adjustment clauses, formula-based contracts or other cost sharing mechanisms. Differences between the costs included in rates and the incurred costs, including undesignated derivative contracts, are largely deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. Piedmont policies allow for the use of financial instruments to hedge commodity price risks. The strategy and objective of these hedging programs are to use the financial instruments to reduce gas cost volatility for customers.\nVolumes\nThe tables below include volumes of outstanding commodity derivatives. Amounts disclosed represent the absolute value of notional volumes of commodity contracts excluding NPNS. The Duke Energy Registrants have netted contractual amounts where offsetting purchase and sale contracts exist with identical delivery locations and times of delivery. Where all commodity positions are perfectly offset, no quantities are shown.\n(a) Duke Energy includes 22,048 GWh that relates to cash flow hedges.\nLOCATION AND FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nThe following tables show the fair value and balance sheet location of derivative instruments. Although derivatives subject to master netting arrangements are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the fair values presented below are shown gross and cash collateral on the derivatives has not been netted against the fair values shown.\nOFFSETTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nThe following tables present the line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets where derivatives are reported. Substantially all of Duke Energy's outstanding derivative contracts are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements. The gross amounts offset in the tables below show the effect of these netting arrangements on financial position and include collateral posted to offset the net position. The amounts shown are calculated by counterparty. Accounts receivable or accounts payable may also be available to offset exposures in the event of bankruptcy. These amounts are not included in the tables below.\nOBJECTIVE CREDIT CONTINGENT FEATURES\nCertain derivative contracts contain objective credit contingent features. These features include the requirement to post cash collateral or letters of credit if specific events occur, such as a credit rating downgrade below investment grade. The following tables show information with respect to derivative contracts that are in a net liability position and contain objective credit-risk-related payment provisions.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants have elected to offset cash collateral and fair values of derivatives. For amounts to be netted, the derivative and cash collateral must be executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement.\n15. INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES\nDuke Energy\u2019s investments in debt and equity securities are primarily comprised of investments held in (i) the NDTF at Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, (ii) the grantor trusts at Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana related to OPEB plans and (iii) Bison. The Duke Energy Registrants classify investments in debt securities as AFS and investments in equity securities as FV-NI.\nFor investments in debt securities classified as AFS, the unrealized gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income until realized, at which time they are reported through net income. For investments in equity securities classified as FV-NI, both realized and unrealized gains and losses are reported through net income. Substantially all of Duke Energy\u2019s investments in debt and equity securities qualify for regulatory accounting, and accordingly, all associated realized and unrealized gains and losses on these investments are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.\nDuke Energy classifies the majority of investments in debt and equity securities as long term, unless otherwise noted.\nInvestment Trusts\nThe investments within the Investment Trusts are managed by independent investment managers with discretion to buy, sell and invest pursuant to the objectives set forth by the investment manager agreements and trust agreements. The Duke Energy Registrants have limited oversight of the day-to-day management of these investments. As a result, the ability to hold investments in unrealized loss positions is outside the control of the Duke Energy Registrants. Accordingly, all unrealized losses associated with debt securities within the Investment Trusts are recognized immediately and deferred to regulatory accounts where appropriate.\nOther AFS Securities\nUnrealized gains and losses on all other AFS securities are included in other comprehensive income until realized, unless it is determined the carrying value of an investment has a credit loss. The Duke Energy Registrants analyze all investment holdings each reporting period to determine whether a decline in fair value is related to a credit loss. If a credit loss exists, the unrealized credit loss is included in earnings. There were no material credit losses as of December 31, 2020, and 2019.\nOther Investments amounts are recorded in Other within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDUKE ENERGY\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value of investments in debt and equity securities; equity investments are classified as FV-NI and debt investments are classified as AFS.\nThe table below summarizes the maturity date for debt securities.\nRealized gains and losses, which were determined on a specific identification basis, from sales of FV-NI and AFS securities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were as follows.\nDUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value of investments in debt and equity securities; equity investments are classified as FV-NI and debt investments are classified as AFS.\nThe table below summarizes the maturity date for debt securities.\nRealized gains and losses, which were determined on a specific identification basis, from sales of FV-NI and AFS securities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were as follows.\nPROGRESS ENERGY\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value of investments in debt and equity securities; equity investments are classified as FV-NI and debt investments are classified as AFS.\nThe table below summarizes the maturity date for debt securities.\nRealized gains and losses, which were determined on a specific identification basis, from sales of FV-NI and AFS securities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were as follows.\nDUKE ENERGY PROGRESS\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value of investments in debt and equity securities; equity investments are classified as FV-NI and debt investments are classified as AFS.\nThe table below summarizes the maturity date for debt securities.\nRealized gains and losses, which were determined on a specific identification basis, from sales of FV-NI and AFS securities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were as follows.\nDUKE ENERGY FLORIDA\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value of investments in debt and equity securities; equity investments are classified as FV-NI and debt investments are classified as AFS.\n(a) During the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, Duke Energy Florida continued to receive reimbursements from the NDTF for costs related to ongoing decommissioning activity of the Crystal River Unit 3.\nThe table below summarizes the maturity date for debt securities.\nRealized gains and losses, which were determined on a specific identification basis, from sales of FV-NI and AFS securities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were as follows.\nDUKE ENERGY INDIANA\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value of investments in debt and equity securities; equity investments are measured at FV-NI and debt investments are classified as AFS.\nThe table below summarizes the maturity date for debt securities.\nRealized gains and losses, which were determined on a specific identification basis, from sales of FV-NI and AFS securities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were immaterial.\n16. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair value is the exchange price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value definition focuses on an exit price versus the acquisition cost. Fair value measurements use market data or assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs may be readily observable, corroborated by market data, or generally unobservable. Valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize use of unobservable inputs. A midmarket pricing convention (the midpoint price between bid and ask prices) is permitted for use as a practical expedient.\nFair value measurements are classified in three levels based on the fair value hierarchy as defined by GAAP. Certain investments are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy. These investments are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The net asset value is derived based on the investment cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.\nFair value accounting guidance permits entities to elect to measure certain financial instruments that are not required to be accounted for at fair value, such as equity method investments or the company\u2019s own debt, at fair value. The Duke Energy Registrants have not elected to record any of these items at fair value.\nValuation methods of the primary fair value measurements disclosed below are as follows.\nInvestments in equity securities\nThe majority of investments in equity securities are valued using Level 1 measurements. Investments in equity securities are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the quarter. Principal active markets for equity prices include published exchanges such as the NYSE and Nasdaq Stock Market. Foreign equity prices are translated from their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market. There was no after-hours market activity that was required to be reflected in the reported fair value measurements.\nInvestments in debt securities\nMost investments in debt securities are valued using Level 2 measurements because the valuations use interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. If the market for a particular fixed-income security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurement is Level 3.\nCommodity derivatives\nCommodity derivatives with clearinghouses are classified as Level 1. Commodity derivatives with observable forward curves are classified as Level 2. If forward price curves are not observable for the full term of the contract and the unobservable period had more than an insignificant impact on the valuation, the commodity derivative is classified as Level 3. In isolation, increases (decreases) in natural gas forward prices result in favorable (unfavorable) fair value adjustments for natural gas purchase contracts; and increases (decreases) in electricity forward prices result in unfavorable (favorable) fair value adjustments for electricity sales contracts. Duke Energy regularly evaluates and validates pricing inputs used to estimate the fair value of natural gas commodity contracts by a market participant price verification procedure. This procedure provides a comparison of internal forward commodity curves to market participant generated curves.\nInterest rate derivatives\nMost over-the-counter interest rate contract derivatives are valued using financial models that utilize observable inputs for similar instruments and are classified as Level 2. Inputs include forward interest rate curves, notional amounts, interest rates and credit quality of the counterparties.\nOther fair value considerations\nSee Note 11 for a discussion of the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets.\nDUKE ENERGY\nThe following tables provide recorded balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative amounts in the tables below for all Duke Energy Registrants exclude cash collateral, which is disclosed in Note 14. See Note 15 for additional information related to investments by major security type for the Duke Energy Registrants.\nThe following table provides reconciliations of beginning and ending balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value using Level 3 measurements.\n(a) Transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 because observable market data became available.\nDUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS\nThe following tables provide recorded balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPROGRESS ENERGY\nThe following table provides recorded balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDUKE ENERGY PROGRESS\nThe following table provides recorded balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDUKE ENERGY FLORIDA\nThe following table provides recorded balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDUKE ENERGY OHIO\nThe recorded balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were not material at December 31, 2020, and 2019.\nDUKE ENERGY INDIANA\nThe following table provides recorded balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value using Level 3 measurements.\nPIEDMONT\nThe following table provides recorded balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value using Level 3 measurements.\n(a) Transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 because observable market data became available.\nQUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS\nThe following tables include quantitative information about the Duke Energy Registrants' derivatives classified as Level 3.\nOTHER FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES\nThe fair value and book value of long-term debt, including current maturities, is summarized in the following table. Estimates determined are not necessarily indicative of amounts that could have been settled in current markets. Fair value of long-term debt uses Level 2 measurements.\n(a) Book value of long-term debt includes $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2020, and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2019, of unamortized debt discount and premium, net in purchase accounting adjustments related to the mergers with Progress Energy and Piedmont that are excluded from fair value of long-term debt.\nAt both December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, notes payable and commercial paper, and nonrecourse notes payable of VIEs are not materially different from their carrying amounts because of the short-term nature of these instruments and/or because the stated rates approximate market rates.\n17. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nA VIE is an entity that is evaluated for consolidation using more than a simple analysis of voting control. The analysis to determine whether an entity is a VIE considers contracts with an entity, credit support for an entity, the adequacy of the equity investment of an entity and the relationship of voting power to the amount of equity invested in an entity. This analysis is performed either upon the creation of a legal entity or upon the occurrence of an event requiring reevaluation, such as a significant change in an entity\u2019s assets or activities. A qualitative analysis of control determines the party that consolidates a VIE. This assessment is based on (i) what party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and (ii) what party has rights to receive benefits or is obligated to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The analysis of the party that consolidates a VIE is a continual reassessment.\nCONSOLIDATED VIEs\nThe obligations of the consolidated VIEs discussed in the following paragraphs are nonrecourse to the Duke Energy Registrants. The registrants have no requirement to provide liquidity to, purchase assets of or guarantee performance of these VIEs unless noted in the following paragraphs.\nNo financial support was provided to any of the consolidated VIEs during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, or is expected to be provided in the future, that was not previously contractually required.\nReceivables Financing - DERF/DEPR/DEFR\nDERF, DEPR and DEFR are bankruptcy remote, special purpose subsidiaries of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, respectively. DERF, DEPR and DEFR are wholly owned LLCs with separate legal existence from their parent companies, and their assets are not generally available to creditors of their parent companies. On a revolving basis, DERF, DEPR and DEFR buy certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity and related services from their parent companies.\nDERF, DEPR and DEFR borrow amounts under credit facilities to buy these receivables. Borrowing availability from the credit facilities is limited to the amount of qualified receivables purchased, which generally exclude receivables past due more than a predetermined number of days and reserves for expected past-due balances. The sole source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligations is cash collections from the receivables. Amounts borrowed under the credit facilities for DERF and DEPR are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Long-Term Debt. Amounts borrowed under the credit facilities for DEFR are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Current maturities of long-term debt.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, as described in Note 1, the Duke Energy Registrants suspended customer disconnections for nonpayment. Since taking action to suspend customer disconnections for nonpayment, certain jurisdictions have now returned to normal operations and billing practices. The full impact of COVID-19 and the Duke Energy Registrant\u2019s related response on customers\u2019 ability to pay for service is uncertain. However, the level of past-due receivables at Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is reasonably possible eventual write-offs of customer receivables may increase over current estimates. In 2020, DERF, DEPR and DEFR executed amendments to their credit facilities to manage the impact of past-due receivables resulting from the suspension of customer disconnections from COVID-19. See Note 3 for information about COVID-19 filings with state utility commissions.\nThe most significant activity that impacts the economic performance of DERF, DEPR and DEFR are the decisions made to manage delinquent receivables. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are considered the primary beneficiaries and consolidate DERF, DEPR and DEFR, respectively, as they make those decisions.\nReceivables Financing - CRC\nCRC is a bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity indirectly owned by Duke Energy. On a revolving basis, CRC buys certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity, natural gas and related services from Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. CRC borrows amounts under a credit facility to buy the receivables from Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. Borrowing availability from the credit facility is limited to the amount of qualified receivables sold to CRC, which generally exclude receivables past due more than a predetermined number of days and reserves for expected past-due balances. The sole source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligation is cash collections from the receivables. Amounts borrowed under the credit facility are reflected on Duke Energy's Consolidated Balance Sheets as Long-Term Debt.\nThe proceeds Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana receive from the sale of receivables to CRC are approximately 75% cash and 25% in the form of a subordinated note from CRC. The subordinated note is a retained interest in the receivables sold. Depending on collection experience, additional equity infusions to CRC may be required by Duke Energy to maintain a minimum equity balance of $3 million.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, as described in Note 1, the Duke Energy Registrants suspended customer disconnections for nonpayment. Since taking action to suspend customer disconnections for nonpayment, certain jurisdictions have now returned to normal operations and billing practices. The full impact of COVID-19 and the Duke Energy Registrant\u2019s related response on customers\u2019 ability to pay for service is uncertain. However, the level of past-due receivables at Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana have increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is reasonably possible eventual write-offs of customer receivables may increase over current estimates. In July of 2020, CRC executed an amendment to its credit facility to manage the impact of past-due receivables resulting from the suspension of customer disconnections from COVID-19. See Note 3 for information about COVID-19 filings with state utility commissions.\nCRC is considered a VIE because (i) equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations, (ii) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity is not held by the equity holder and (iii) deficiencies in net worth of CRC are funded by Duke Energy. The most significant activities that impact the economic performance of CRC are decisions made to manage delinquent receivables. Duke Energy is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates CRC as it makes these decisions. Neither Duke Energy Ohio nor Duke Energy Indiana consolidate CRC.\nReceivables Financing - Credit Facilities\nThe following table summarizes the amounts and expiration dates of the credit facilities and associated restricted receivables described above.\nNuclear Asset-Recovery Bonds - Duke Energy Florida Project Finance, LLC (DEFPF)\nDEFPF is a bankruptcy remote, wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of Duke Energy Florida. DEFPF was formed in 2016 for the sole purpose of issuing nuclear asset-recovery bonds to finance Duke Energy Florida's unrecovered regulatory asset related to Crystal River Unit 3.\nIn 2016, DEFPF issued senior secured bonds and used the proceeds to acquire nuclear asset-recovery property from Duke Energy Florida. The nuclear asset-recovery property acquired includes the right to impose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable nuclear asset-recovery charge from all Duke Energy Florida retail customers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. The nuclear asset-recovery bonds are secured by the nuclear asset-recovery property and cash collections from the nuclear asset-recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. The bondholders have no recourse to Duke Energy Florida.\nDEFPF is considered a VIE primarily because the equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. Duke Energy Florida has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE as described above and therefore Duke Energy Florida is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates DEFPF.\nThe following table summarizes the impact of DEFPF on Duke Energy Florida's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCommercial Renewables\nCertain of Duke Energy\u2019s renewable energy facilities are VIEs due to Duke Energy issuing guarantees for debt service and operations and maintenance reserves in support of debt financings. Assets are restricted and cannot be pledged as collateral or sold to third parties without prior approval of debt holders. Additionally, Duke Energy has VIEs associated with tax equity arrangements entered into with third-party investors in order to finance the cost of renewable assets eligible for tax credits. The activities that most significantly impacted the economic performance of these renewable energy facilities were decisions associated with siting, negotiating PPAs and EPC agreements, and decisions associated with ongoing operations and maintenance-related activities. Duke Energy is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates the entities as it is responsible for all of these decisions.\nThe table below presents material balances reported on Duke Energy's Consolidated Balance Sheets related to Commercial Renewables VIEs.\nNON-CONSOLIDATED VIEs\nThe following tables summarize the impact of non-consolidated VIEs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are not aware of any situations where the maximum exposure to loss significantly exceeds the carrying values shown above except for the PPA with OVEC, which is discussed below, and future exit costs associated with the cancellation of the ACP pipeline, as discussed below.\nPipeline Investments\nDuke Energy has investments in various joint ventures to construct and operate pipeline projects. These entities are considered VIEs due to having insufficient equity to finance their own activities without subordinated financial support. Duke Energy does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of these VIEs and therefore does not consolidate these entities.\nDuke Energy has a 47% ownership interest in ACP. In 2020, Duke Energy determined that it would no longer invest in the construction of the ACP pipeline. The current liability related to the cancellation of the ACP pipeline represents Duke Energy's continuing obligation to fund its share of ACP's obligations. See Notes 3, 7 and 12 for further information regarding this transaction.\nCommercial Renewables\nDuke Energy has investments in various renewable energy project entities. Some of these entities are VIEs due to Duke Energy issuing guarantees for debt service and operations and maintenance reserves in support of debt financings. Duke Energy does not consolidate these VIEs because power to direct and control key activities is shared jointly by Duke Energy and other owners.\nOVEC\nDuke Energy Ohio\u2019s 9% ownership interest in OVEC is considered a non-consolidated VIE due to OVEC having insufficient equity to finance its activities without subordinated financial support. The activities that most significantly impact OVEC's economic performance include fuel strategy and supply activities and decisions associated with ongoing operations and maintenance-related activities. Duke Energy Ohio does not have the unilateral power to direct these activities, and therefore, does not consolidate OVEC.\nAs a counterparty to an Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA), Duke Energy Ohio has a contractual arrangement to receive entitlements to capacity and energy from OVEC\u2019s power plants through June 2040 commensurate with its power participation ratio, which is equivalent to Duke Energy Ohio's ownership interest. Costs, including fuel, operating expenses, fixed costs, debt amortization and interest expense, are allocated to counterparties to the ICPA based on their power participation ratio. The value of the ICPA is subject to variability due to fluctuation in power prices and changes in OVEC's cost of business. On March 31, 2018, FES, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. and an ICPA counterparty with a power participation ratio of 4.85%, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which could increase costs allocated to the counterparties. On July 31, 2018, the bankruptcy court rejected the FES ICPA, which means OVEC is an unsecured creditor in the FES bankruptcy proceeding. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the impact of the bankruptcy filing on its OVEC interests. In addition, certain proposed environmental rulemaking could result in future increased OVEC cost allocations. In July 2020, legislation was proposed to repeal HB 6. Duke Energy cannot predict the outcome of this matter. See Note 3 for additional information.\nCRC\nSee discussion under Consolidated VIEs for additional information related to CRC.\nAmounts included in Receivables from affiliated companies in the above table for Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana reflect their retained interest in receivables sold to CRC. These subordinated notes held by Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are stated at fair value. Carrying values of retained interests are determined by allocating carrying value of the receivables between assets sold and interests retained based on relative fair value. The allocated bases of the subordinated notes are not materially different than their face value because (i) the receivables generally turnover in less than two months, (ii) credit losses are reasonably predictable due to the broad customer base and lack of significant concentration and (iii) the equity in CRC is subordinate to all retained interests and thus would absorb losses first. The hypothetical effect on fair value of the retained interests assuming both a 10% and a 20% unfavorable variation in credit losses or discount rates is not material due to the short turnover of receivables and historically low credit loss history. Interest accrues to Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana on the retained interests using the acceptable yield method. This method generally approximates the stated rate on the notes since the allocated basis and the face value are nearly equivalent. An impairment charge is recorded against the carrying value of both retained interests and purchased beneficial interest whenever it is determined that an OTTI has occurred.\nKey assumptions used in estimating fair value are detailed in the following table.\nThe following table shows the gross and net receivables sold.\nThe following table shows sales and cash flows related to receivables sold.\nCash flows from sales of receivables are reflected within Cash Flows From Operating Activities and Cash Flows from Investing Activities on Duke Energy Ohio\u2019s and Duke Energy Indiana\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nCollection fees received in connection with servicing transferred accounts receivable are included in Operation, maintenance and other on Duke Energy Ohio\u2019s and Duke Energy Indiana\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The loss recognized on sales of receivables is calculated monthly by multiplying receivables sold during the month by the required discount. The required discount is derived monthly utilizing a three-year weighted average formula that considers charge-off history, late charge history and turnover history on the sold receivables, as well as a component for the time value of money. The discount rate, or component for the time value of money, is the prior month-end LIBOR plus a fixed rate of 1%.\n18. REVENUE\nDuke Energy recognizes revenue consistent with amounts billed under tariff offerings or at contractually agreed upon rates based on actual physical delivery of electric or natural gas service, including estimated volumes delivered when billings have not yet occurred. As such, the majority of Duke Energy\u2019s revenues have fixed pricing based on the contractual terms of the published tariffs, with variability in expected cash flows attributable to the customer\u2019s volumetric demand and ultimate quantities of energy or natural gas supplied and used during the billing period. The stand-alone selling price of related sales are designed to support recovery of prudently incurred costs and an appropriate return on invested assets and are primarily governed by published tariff rates or contractual agreements approved by relevant regulatory bodies. As described in Note 1, certain excise taxes and franchise fees levied by state or local governments are required to be paid even if not collected from the customer. These taxes are recognized on a gross basis as part of revenues. Duke Energy elects to account for all other taxes net of revenues.\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time as energy or natural gas is delivered and consumed with billings generally occurring monthly and related payments due within 30 days, depending on regulatory requirements. In no event does the timing between payment and delivery of the goods and services exceed one year. Using this output method for revenue recognition provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of electric and natural gas service as customers obtain control of the commodity and benefit from its use at delivery. Additionally, Duke Energy has an enforceable right to consideration for energy or natural gas delivered at any discrete point in time and will recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which Duke Energy is entitled for the energy or natural gas delivered.\nAs described above, the majority of Duke Energy\u2019s tariff revenues are at-will and, as such, related contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less and will not have future performance obligations for disclosure. Additionally, other long-term revenue streams, including wholesale contracts, generally provide services that are part of a single performance obligation, the delivery of electricity or natural gas. As such, other than material fixed consideration under long-term contracts, related disclosures for future performance obligations are also not applicable.\nDuke Energy earns substantially all of its revenues through its reportable segments, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure earns the majority of its revenues through retail and wholesale electric service through the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. Duke Energy generally provides retail and wholesale electric service customers with their full electric load requirements or with supplemental load requirements when the customer has other sources of electricity.\nRetail electric service is generally marketed throughout Duke Energy's electric service territory through standard service offers. The standard service offers are through tariffs determined by regulators in Duke Energy's regulated service territory. Each tariff, which is assigned to customers based on customer class, has multiple components such as an energy charge, a demand charge, a basic facilities charge and applicable riders. Duke Energy considers each of these components to be aggregated into a single performance obligation for providing electric service, or in the case of distribution only customers in Duke Energy Ohio, for delivering electricity. Electricity is considered a single performance obligation satisfied over time consistent with the series guidance and is provided and consumed over the billing period, generally one month. Retail electric service is typically provided to at-will customers who can cancel service at any time, without a substantive penalty. Additionally, Duke Energy adheres to applicable regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction to ensure the collectability of amounts billed and appropriate mitigating procedures are followed when necessary. As such, revenue from contracts with customers for such contracts is equivalent to the electricity supplied and billed in that period (including unbilled estimates).\nWholesale electric service is generally provided under long-term contracts using cost-based pricing. FERC regulates costs that may be recovered from customers and the amount of return companies are permitted to earn. Wholesale contracts include both energy and demand charges. For full requirements contracts, Duke Energy considers both charges as a single performance obligation for providing integrated electric service. For contracts where energy and demand charges are considered separate performance obligations, energy and demand are each a distinct performance obligation under the series guidance and are satisfied as energy is delivered and stand-ready service is provided on a monthly basis. This service represents consumption over the billing period and revenue is recognized consistent with billings and unbilled estimates, which generally occur monthly. Contractual amounts owed are typically trued up annually based upon incurred costs in accordance with FERC published filings and the specific customer\u2019s actual peak demand. Estimates of variable consideration related to potential additional billings or refunds owed are updated quarterly.\nThe majority of wholesale revenues are full requirements contracts where the customers purchase the substantial majority of their energy needs and do not have a fixed quantity of contractually required energy or capacity. As such, related forecasted revenues are considered optional purchases. Supplemental requirements contracts that include contracted blocks of energy and capacity at contractually fixed prices have the following estimated remaining performance obligations:\nRevenues for block sales are recognized monthly as energy is delivered and stand-ready service is provided, consistent with invoiced amounts and unbilled estimates.\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure earns its revenue through retail and wholesale natural gas service through the transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas. Duke Energy generally provides retail and wholesale natural gas service customers with all natural gas load requirements. Additionally, while natural gas can be stored, substantially all natural gas provided by Duke Energy is consumed by customers simultaneously with receipt of delivery.\nRetail natural gas service is marketed throughout Duke Energy's natural gas service territory using published tariff rates. The tariff rates are established by regulators in Duke Energy's service territories. Each tariff, which is assigned to customers based on customer class, have multiple components, such as a commodity charge, demand charge, customer or monthly charge and transportation costs. Duke Energy considers each of these components to be aggregated into a single performance obligation for providing natural gas service. For contracts where Duke Energy provides all of the customer\u2019s natural gas needs, the delivery of natural gas is considered a single performance obligation satisfied over time, and revenue is recognized monthly based on billings and unbilled estimates as service is provided and the commodity is consumed over the billing period. Additionally, natural gas service is typically at-will and customers can cancel service at any time, without a substantive penalty. Duke Energy also adheres to applicable regulatory requirements to ensure the collectability of amounts billed and receivable and appropriate mitigating procedures are followed when necessary.\nCertain long-term individually negotiated contracts exist to provide natural gas service. These contracts are regulated and approved by state commissions. The negotiated contracts have multiple components, including a natural gas and a demand charge, similar to retail natural gas contracts. Duke Energy considers each of these components to be a single performance obligation for providing natural gas service. This service represents consumption over the billing period, generally one month.\nFixed capacity payments under long-term contracts for the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment include minimum margin contracts and supply arrangements with municipalities and power generation facilities. Revenues for related sales are recognized monthly as natural gas is delivered and stand-ready service is provided, consistent with invoiced amounts and unbilled estimates. Estimated remaining performance obligations are as follows:\nCommercial Renewables\nCommercial Renewables earns the majority of its revenues through long-term PPAs and generally sells all of its wind and solar facility output, electricity and RECs to customers. The majority of these PPAs have historically been accounted for as leases. For PPAs that are not accounted for as leases, the delivery of electricity and the delivery of RECs are considered separate performance obligations.\nThe delivery of electricity is a performance obligation satisfied over time and represents generation and consumption of the electricity over the billing period, generally one month. The delivery of RECs is a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time and represents delivery of each REC generated by the wind or solar facility. The majority of self-generated RECs are bundled with energy in Duke Energy\u2019s contracts and, as such, related revenues are recognized as energy is generated and delivered as that pattern is consistent with Duke Energy\u2019s performance. Commercial Renewables recognizes revenue based on the energy generated and billed for the period, generally one month, at contractual rates (including unbilled estimates) according to the invoice practical expedient. Amounts are typically due within 30 days of invoice.\nCommercial Renewables also earns revenues from installation of distributed solar generation resources, which is primarily composed of EPC projects to deliver functioning solar power systems, generally completed within two to 12 months from commencement of construction. The installation of distributed solar generation resources is a performance obligation that is satisfied over time. Revenue from fixed-price EPC contracts is recognized using the input method as work is performed based on the estimated ratio of incurred costs to estimated total costs.\nOther\nThe remainder of Duke Energy\u2019s operations is presented as Other, which does not include material revenues from contracts with customers.\nDisaggregated Revenues\nFor the Electric and Gas Utility and Infrastructure segments, revenue by customer class is most meaningful to Duke Energy as each respective customer class collectively represents unique customer expectations of service, generally has different energy and demand requirements, and operates under tailored, regulatory approved pricing structures. Additionally, each customer class is impacted differently by weather and a variety of economic factors including the level of population growth, economic investment, employment levels, and regulatory activities in each of Duke Energy\u2019s jurisdictions. As such, analyzing revenues disaggregated by customer class allows Duke Energy to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. For the Commercial Renewables segment, the majority of revenues from contracts with customers are from selling all of the unit-contingent output at contractually defined pricing under long-term PPAs with consistent expectations regarding the timing and certainty of cash flows. Disaggregated revenues are presented as follows:\n(a) Other revenue sources include revenues from leases, derivatives and alternative revenue programs that are not considered revenues from contracts with customers. Alternative revenue programs in certain jurisdictions include regulatory mechanisms that periodically adjust for over or under collection of related revenues.\n(a) Other revenue sources include revenues from leases, derivatives and alternative revenue programs that are not considered revenues from contracts with customers. Alternative revenue programs in certain jurisdictions include regulatory mechanisms that periodically adjust for over or under collection of related revenues.\n(a) Other revenue sources include revenues from leases, derivatives and alternative revenue programs that are not considered revenues from contracts with customers. Alternative revenue programs in certain jurisdictions include regulatory mechanisms that periodically adjust for over or under collection of related revenues.\nAs described in Note 1, Duke Energy adopted the new guidance for credit losses effective January 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective method of adoption, which does not require restatement of prior year reported results. The following table presents the reserve for credit losses for trade and other receivables based on adoption of the new standard.\nTrade and other receivables are evaluated based on an estimate of the risk of loss over the life of the receivable and current and historical conditions using supportable assumptions. Management evaluates the risk of loss for trade and other receivables by comparing the historical write-off amounts to total revenue over a specified period. Historical loss rates are adjusted due to the impact of current conditions, including the impacts of COVID-19, as well as forecasted conditions over a reasonable time period. The calculated write-off rate can be applied to the receivable balance for which an established reserve does not already exist. Management reviews the assumptions and risk of loss periodically for trade and other receivables. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as described in Note 1, certain jurisdictions have resumed standard billing and credit practices, disconnections for nonpayment and late payment charges, all of which were previously suspended in the first quarter of 2020. The specific actions taken by each Duke Energy Registrant are described in Note 3 and the impact of COVID-19 on certain receivables financing entities are described in Note 17. The impact of COVID-19 and Duke Energy\u2019s related response on customers\u2019 ability to pay for service is uncertain, and it is reasonably possible eventual write-offs of customer receivables may increase over current estimates.\nThe aging of trade receivables is presented in the table below. Duke Energy considers receivables greater than 30 days outstanding past due.\n(a) Due to certain customer financial hardships created by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting stay-at-home orders, Duke Energy permitted customers to defer payment of past-due amounts through an installment payment plan over a period of several months.\nIMPACT OF WEATHER AND THE TIMING OF BILLING PERIODS\nRevenues and costs are influenced by seasonal weather patterns. Peak sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months, which results in higher revenue and cash flows during these periods. By contrast, lower sales of electricity occur during the spring and fall, allowing for scheduled plant maintenance. Residential and general service customers are more impacted by weather than industrial customers. Estimated weather impacts are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather conditions. Normal weather conditions are defined as the long-term average of actual historical weather conditions. Heating degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature falls below a base temperature. Cooling degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature rises above the base temperature. Each degree of temperature below the base temperature counts as one heating degree day and each degree of temperature above the base temperature counts as one cooling degree day.\nThe estimated impact of weather on earnings for Electric Utilities and Infrastructure is based on the temperature variances from a normal condition and customers' historic usage patterns. The methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions, such as humidity in the summer or wind chill in the winter. The precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long-term weather trends to shorter-term periods.\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure's costs and revenues are influenced by seasonal patterns due to peak natural gas sales occurring during the winter months as a result of space heating requirements. Residential customers are the most impacted by weather. There are certain regulatory mechanisms for the North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky service territories that normalize the margins collected from certain customer classes during the winter. In North Carolina, rate design provides protection from both weather and other usage variations such as conservation, while South Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky revenues are adjusted solely based on weather. Ohio primarily employs a fixed charge each month regardless of the season and usage.\nUNBILLED REVENUE\nUnbilled revenues are recognized by applying customer billing rates to the estimated volumes of energy or natural gas delivered but not yet billed. Unbilled revenues can vary significantly from period to period as a result of seasonality, weather, customer usage patterns, customer mix, average price in effect for customer classes, timing of rendering customer bills and meter reading schedules, and the impact of weather normalization or margin decoupling mechanisms.\nUnbilled revenues are included within Receivables and Receivables of VIEs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as shown in the following table.\nAdditionally, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell, on a revolving basis, nearly all of their retail accounts receivable, including receivables for unbilled revenues, to an affiliate, CRC and account for the transfers of receivables as sales. Accordingly, the receivables sold are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 17 for further information. These receivables for unbilled revenues are shown in the table below.\n19. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to Duke Energy common stockholders, as adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities and accumulated preferred dividends, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to Duke Energy common stockholders, as adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities and accumulated preferred dividends, by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock, such as equity forward sale agreements, were exercised or settled. Duke Energy\u2019s participating securities are RSUs that are entitled to dividends declared on Duke Energy common stock during the RSUs vesting periods. Dividends declared on preferred stock are recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of net income to arrive at net income available to Duke Energy common stockholders. Dividends accumulated on preferred stock are an adjustment to net income used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.\nThe following table presents Duke Energy\u2019s basic and diluted EPS calculations, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common and preferred share dividends declared.\n(a) Performance stock awards were not included in the dilutive securities calculation because the performance measures related to the awards had not been met.\nCommon Stock\nIn November 2019, Duke Energy filed a prospectus supplement and executed an Equity Distribution Agreement (EDA) under which it may sell up to $1.5 billion of its common stock through a new ATM offering program, including an equity forward sales component. Under the terms of the EDA, Duke Energy may issue and sell shares of common stock through September 2022.\nSeparately, in November 2019, Duke Energy marketed an equity offering of 28.75 million shares of common stock through an Underwriting Agreement. In connection with the offering, Duke Energy entered into equity forward sales agreements with an initial forward price of $85.99 per share. In March 2020, Duke Energy marketed approximately 940,000 shares of common stock through an equity forward transaction under the ATM with an initial forward price of $89.76 per share. In May 2020, Duke Energy marketed approximately 903,000 shares of common stock through an equity forward transaction under the ATM with an initial forward price of $82.44 per share. In August 2020, Duke Energy marketed approximately 936,000 shares of common stock through an equity forward transaction under the ATM with an initial forward price of $79.52 per share.\nIn December 2020, Duke Energy physically settled the equity forwards by delivering 32 million shares of common stock in exchange for net cash proceeds of approximately $2.6 billion.\nPreferred Stock\nOn March 29, 2019, Duke Energy completed the issuance of 40 million depositary shares, each representing 1/1,000th share of its Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, at a price of $25 per depositary share. The transaction resulted in net proceeds of $973 million after issuance costs with proceeds used for general corporate purposes and to reduce short-term debt. The preferred stock has a $25 liquidation preference per depositary share and earns dividends on a cumulative basis at a rate of 5.75% per annum. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on the 16th day of March, June, September and December, and began on June 16, 2019.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock has no maturity or mandatory redemption date, is not redeemable at the option of the holders and includes separate call options. The first call option allows Duke Energy to call the Series A Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $25.50 per depositary share prior to June 15, 2024, in whole but not in part, at any time within 120 days after a ratings event where a rating agency amends, clarifies or changes the criteria it uses to assign equity credit for securities such as the preferred stock. The second call option allows Duke Energy to call the preferred stock, in whole or in part, at any time, on or after June 15, 2024, at a redemption price of $25 per depositary share. Duke Energy is also required to redeem all accumulated and unpaid dividends if either call option is exercised.\nOn September 12, 2019, Duke Energy completed the issuance of 1 million shares of its Series B Fixed-Rate Reset Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, at a price of $1,000 per share. The transaction resulted in net proceeds of $989 million after issuance costs with proceeds being used to pay down short-term debt, repay at maturity $500 million senior notes due September 2019, and for general corporate purposes. The preferred stock has a $1,000 liquidation preference per share and earns dividends on a cumulative basis at an initial rate of 4.875% per annum. Dividends are payable semiannually in arrears on the 16th day of March and September, and began on March 16, 2020. On September 16, 2024, the First Call Date, and any fifth anniversary of the First Call Date (each a Reset Date), the dividend rate will reset based on the then current five-year U.S. Treasury rate plus a spread of 3.388%.\nThe Series B Preferred Stock has no maturity or mandatory redemption date, is not redeemable at the option of the holders and includes separate call options. The first call option allows Duke Energy to call the Series B Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $1,020 per share, in whole but not in part, at any time within 120 days after a ratings event. The second call option allows Duke Energy to call the preferred stock, in whole or in part, on the First Call Date or any subsequent Reset Date at a redemption price in cash equal to $1,000 per share. Duke Energy is also required to redeem all accumulated and unpaid dividends if either call option is exercised.\nDividends issued on its Series A and Series B Preferred Stock are subject to approval by the Board of Directors. However, the deferral of dividend payments on the preferred stock prohibits the declaration of common stock dividends.\nThe Series A and Series B Preferred Stock rank, with respect to dividends and distributions upon liquidation or dissolution:\n\u2022senior to Common Stock and to each other class or series of capital stock established after the original issue date of the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock that is expressly made subordinated to the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock;\n\u2022on a parity with any class or series of capital stock established after the original issue date of the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock that is not expressly made senior or subordinated to the Series A or Series B Preferred Stock;\n\u2022junior to any class or series of capital stock established after the original issue date of the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock that is expressly made senior to the Series A or Series B Preferred Stock;\n\u2022junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including indebtedness outstanding under Duke Energy's credit facilities, unsecured senior notes, junior subordinated debentures and commercial paper) and other liabilities with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against Duke Energy; and\n\u2022structurally subordinated to existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of Duke Energy's subsidiaries and future preferred stock of subsidiaries.\nHolders of Series A and Series B Preferred Stock have no voting rights with respect to matters that generally require the approval of voting stockholders. The limited voting rights of holders of Series A and Series B Preferred Stock include the right to vote as a single class, respectively, on certain matters that may affect the preference or special rights of the preferred stock, except in the instance that Duke Energy elects to defer the payment of dividends for a total of six quarterly full dividend periods for Series A Preferred Stock or three semiannual full dividend periods for Series B Preferred Stock. If dividends are deferred for a cumulative total of six quarterly full dividend periods for Series A Preferred Stock or three semiannual full dividend periods for Series B Preferred Stock, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, holders of the respective preferred stock have the right to elect two additional Board members to the Board of Directors.\n20. SEVERANCE\nDuring 2020, as a result of partial settlements between Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and the Public Staff, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress deferred as Regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, approximately $65 million and $33 million, respectively, of previously recorded severance charges within Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These severance charges were previously recorded during 2018, as Duke Energy reviewed its operations and identified opportunities for improvement to better serve its customers. This operational review included the company's workforce strategy and staffing levels to ensure the company was staffed with the right skill sets and number of teammates to execute the long-term vision for Duke Energy. As such, Duke Energy extended voluntary and involuntary severance benefits to certain employees in specific areas as a part of workforce planning and digital transformation efforts. See Note 3 for more information.\nThe following table presents the direct and allocated severance and related charges accrued for approximately 30 employees in 2020, 140 employees in 2019, and 1,900 employees in 2018, by the Duke Energy Registrants within Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(a) Includes unamortized deferred severance charges of approximately $(86) million, $(57) million, $(29) million and $(29) million for Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Progress, respectively.\n(b) Includes adjustments associated with 2018 severance charges of approximately $(6) million, $(2) million, $(3) million and $(2) million for Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Progress, respectively.\nThe table below presents the severance liability for past and ongoing severance plans including the plans described above.\n21. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Duke Energy Corporation 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan) provides for the grant of stock-based compensation awards to employees and outside directors. The 2015 Plan reserves 10 million shares of common stock for issuance. Duke Energy has historically issued new shares upon exercising or vesting of share-based awards. However, Duke Energy may use a combination of new share issuances and open market repurchases for share-based awards that are exercised or vest in the future. Duke Energy has not determined with certainty the amount of such new share issuances or open market repurchases.\nThe following table summarizes the total expense recognized by the Duke Energy Registrants, net of tax, for stock-based compensation.\nDuke Energy's pretax stock-based compensation costs, the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation expense and stock-based compensation costs capitalized are included in the following table.\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS\nRSU awards generally vest over periods from immediate to three years. Fair value amounts are based on the market price of Duke Energy's common stock on the grant date. The following table includes information related to RSU awards.\nThe following table summarizes information about RSU awards outstanding.\nThe total grant date fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, was $43 million, $49 million and $43 million, respectively. At December 31, 2020, Duke Energy had $31 million of unrecognized compensation cost, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 23 months.\nPERFORMANCE AWARDS\nStock-based performance awards generally vest after three years if performance targets are met. The actual number of shares issued will range from zero to 200% of target shares, depending on the level of performance achieved.\nPerformance awards contain performance conditions and a market condition. The performance conditions are based on Duke Energy's cumulative adjusted EPS and total incident case rate (total incident case rate is one of our key employee safety metrics). The market condition is based on TSR of Duke Energy relative to a predefined peer group.\nRelative TSR is valued using a path-dependent model that incorporates expected relative TSR into the fair value determination of Duke Energy\u2019s performance-based share awards. The model uses three-year historical volatilities and correlations for all companies in the predefined peer group, including Duke Energy, to simulate Duke Energy\u2019s relative TSR as of the end of the performance period. For each simulation, Duke Energy\u2019s relative TSR associated with the simulated stock price at the end of the performance period plus expected dividends within the period results in a value per share for the award portfolio. The average of these simulations is the expected portfolio value per share. Actual life to date results of Duke Energy\u2019s relative TSR for each grant are incorporated within the model. For performance awards granted in 2020, the model used a risk-free interest rate of 1.4%, which reflects the yield on three-year Treasury bonds as of the grant date, and an expected volatility of 13.6% based on Duke Energy's historical volatility over three years using daily stock prices.\nThe following table includes information related to stock-based performance awards.\nThe following table summarizes information about stock-based performance awards outstanding and assumes payout at the target level.\nThe total grant date fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, was $36 million and $23 million, respectively. At December 31, 2020, Duke Energy had $23 million of unrecognized compensation cost, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 21 months.\n22. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nDEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS\nDuke Energy and certain subsidiaries maintain, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, qualified, non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans. The Duke Energy plans cover most employees using a cash balance formula. Under a cash balance formula, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits based upon a percentage of current eligible earnings, age or age and years of service and interest credits. Certain employees are eligible for benefits that use a final average earnings formula. Under these final average earnings formulas, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit equal to the sum of percentages of their (i) highest three-year, four-year, or five-year average earnings, (ii) highest three-year, four-year, or five-year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of participation (maximum of 35 years) or (iii) highest three-year average earnings times years of participation in excess of 35 years. Duke Energy also maintains, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, non-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans that cover certain executives. The qualified and non-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit plans are closed to new participants.\nDuke Energy uses a December 31 measurement date for its defined benefit retirement plan assets and obligations. Actuarial gains experienced by the defined benefit retirement plans in remeasuring plan assets as of December 31, 2020, and 2019, were attributable to actual investment performance that exceeded expected investment performance. Actuarial losses experienced by the defined benefit retirement plans in remeasuring plan obligations as of December 31, 2020, and 2019, were primarily attributable to the decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan obligations.\nAs a result of the application of settlement accounting due to total lump-sum benefit payments exceeding the settlement threshold (defined as the sum of the service cost and interest cost on projected benefit obligation components of net periodic pension costs) for one of its qualified pension plans, Duke Energy recognized settlement charges of $94 million, primarily as a regulatory asset within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 (an immaterial amount was recorded in Other income and expenses, net within the Consolidated Statement of Operations).\nSettlement charges recognized by the Subsidiary Registrants as of December 31, 2019, which represent amounts allocated by Duke Energy for employees of the Subsidiary Registrants and allocated charges for their proportionate share of settlement charges for employees of Duke Energy\u2019s shared services affiliate, were $53 million for Duke Energy Carolinas, $26 million for Progress Energy, $20 million for Duke Energy Progress, $6 million for Duke Energy Florida, $4 million for Duke Energy Indiana, $2 million for Duke Energy Ohio and $8 million for Piedmont.\nThe settlement charges reflect the recognition of a pro-rata portion of previously unrecognized actuarial losses, equal to the percentage of reduction in the projected benefit obligation resulting from total lump-sum benefit payments as of December 31, 2019. Settlement charges recognized as a regulatory asset within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are amortized over the average remaining service period for participants in the plan. Amortization of settlement charges is disclosed in the tables below as a component of net periodic pension costs.\nNet periodic benefit costs disclosed in the tables below represent the cost of the respective benefit plan for the periods presented prior to capitalization of amounts reflected as Net property, plant and equipment, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Only the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs is eligible to be capitalized. The remaining non-capitalized portions of net periodic benefit costs are classified as either: (1) service cost, which is recorded in Operations, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations; or as (2) components of non-service cost, which is recorded in Other income and expenses, net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amounts presented in the tables below for the Subsidiary Registrants represent the amounts of pension and other post-retirement benefit cost allocated by Duke Energy for employees of the Subsidiary Registrants. Additionally, the Consolidated Statements of Operations of the Subsidiary Registrants also include allocated net periodic benefit costs for their proportionate share of pension and post-retirement benefit cost for employees of Duke Energy\u2019s shared services affiliate that provide support to the Subsidiary Registrants. However, in the tables below, these amounts are only presented within the Duke Energy column (except for amortization of settlement charges). These allocated amounts are included in the governance and shared service costs discussed in Note 13.\nDuke Energy\u2019s policy is to fund amounts on an actuarial basis to provide assets sufficient to meet benefit payments to be paid to plan participants. Duke Energy does not anticipate making any contributions in 2021. The following table includes information related to the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans.\nQUALIFIED PENSION PLANS\nComponents of Net Periodic Pension Costs\n(a) Duke Energy amounts exclude $4 million, $4 million and $5 million for the years ended December 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of regulatory asset amortization resulting from purchase accounting adjustments associated with Duke Energy's merger with Cinergy in April 2006.\n(b) Duke Energy Ohio amounts exclude $2 million, $2 million and $2 million for the years ended December 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of regulatory asset amortization resulting from purchase accounting adjustments associated with Duke Energy's merger with Cinergy in April 2006.\nAmounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and Regulatory Assets\nReconciliation of Funded Status to Net Amount Recognized\nAmounts Recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(a) Included in Other within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(b) Included in Accrued pension and other post-retirement benefit costs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInformation for Plans with Accumulated Benefit Obligation in Excess of Plan Assets\nAssumptions Used for Pension Benefits Accounting\nThe discount rate used to determine the current year pension obligation and following year\u2019s pension expense is based on a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan\u2019s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.\nThe average remaining service period for participants in active plans and life expectancy of participants in inactive plans is 13 years for Duke Energy, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Ohio, 14 years for Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, 12 years for Duke Energy Carolinas and nine years for Piedmont.\nThe following tables present the assumptions or range of assumptions used for pension benefit accounting.\nExpected Benefit Payments\nNON-QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS\nThe accumulated benefit obligation, which equals the projected benefit obligation for non-qualified pension plans, was $320 million for Duke Energy, $13 million for Duke Energy Carolinas, $111 million for Progress Energy, $33 million for Duke Energy Progress, $45 million for Duke Energy Florida, $4 million for Duke Energy Ohio, $2 million for Duke Energy Indiana and $4 million for Piedmont as of December 31, 2020.\nEmployer contributions, which equal benefits paid for non-qualified pension plans, were $23 million for Duke Energy, $2 million for Duke Energy Carolinas, $8 million for Progress Energy, $3 million for Duke Energy Progress and $3 million for Duke Energy Florida for the year ended December 31, 2020. Employer contributions were not material for Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana or Piedmont for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet periodic pension costs for non-qualified pension plans were not material for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nOTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS\nDuke Energy provides, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and non-contributory basis. Employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement, as defined in the plans. The health care benefits include medical, dental and prescription drug coverage and are subject to certain limitations, such as deductibles and copayments.\nDuke Energy did not make any pre-funding contributions to its other post-retirement benefit plans during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nComponents of Net Periodic Other Post-Retirement Benefit Costs\n(a) Duke Energy amounts exclude $6 million, $6 million and $7 million for the years ended December 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of regulatory asset amortization resulting from purchase accounting adjustments associated with Duke Energy's merger with Cinergy in April 2006.\n(b) Duke Energy Ohio amounts exclude $1 million, $2 million and $2 million for the years ended December 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of regulatory asset amortization resulting from purchase accounting adjustments associated with Duke Energy's merger with Cinergy in April 2006.\nAmounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\nReconciliation of Funded Status to Accrued Other Post-Retirement Benefit Costs\nAmounts Recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(a) Included in Other within Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(b) Included in Accrued pension and other post-retirement benefit costs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAssumptions Used for Other Post-Retirement Benefits Accounting\nThe discount rate used to determine the current year other post-retirement benefits obligation and following year\u2019s other post-retirement benefits expense is based on a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan\u2019s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.\nThe average remaining service period of active covered employees is eight years for Duke Energy, seven years for Progress Energy, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Ohio and six years for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont.\nThe following tables present the assumptions used for other post-retirement benefits accounting.\nAssumed Health Care Cost Trend Rate\nExpected Benefit Payments\nPLAN ASSETS\nDescription and Allocations\nDuke Energy Master Retirement Trust\nAssets for both the qualified pension and other post-retirement benefits are maintained in the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust. Approximately 98% of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust assets were allocated to qualified pension plans and approximately 2% were allocated to other post-retirement plans (comprised of 401(h) accounts), as of December 31, 2020, and 2019. The investment objective of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust is to invest in a diverse portfolio of assets that is expected to generate positive surplus return over time (i.e., asset growth greater than liability growth) subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan participants.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Duke Energy assumes pension and other post-retirement plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 6.5%. The expected long-term rate of return was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers, where applicable. The asset allocation targets were set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile. Equity securities are held for their higher expected returns. Debt securities are primarily held to hedge the qualified pension plan. Return seeking debt securities, hedge funds and other global securities are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers or investments.\nEffective January 1, 2020, the target asset allocation for the Duke Energy Retirement Master Trust is 58% liability hedging assets and 42% return-seeking assets. Duke Energy periodically reviews its asset allocation targets, and over time, as the funded status of the benefit plans increase, the level of asset risk relative to plan liabilities may be reduced to better manage Duke Energy's benefit plan liabilities and reduce funded status volatility.\nThe Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust is authorized to engage in the lending of certain plan assets. Securities lending is an investment management enhancement that utilizes certain existing securities of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust to earn additional income. Securities lending involves the loaning of securities to approved parties. In return for the loaned securities, the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust receives collateral in the form of cash and securities as a safeguard against possible default of any borrower on the return of the loan under terms that permit the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust to sell the securities. The Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust mitigates credit risk associated with securities lending arrangements by monitoring the fair value of the securities loaned, with additional collateral obtained or refunded as necessary. The fair value of securities on loan was approximately $482 million and $351 million at December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Cash and securities obtained as collateral exceeded the fair value of the securities loaned at December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Securities lending income earned by the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nQualified pension and other post-retirement benefits for the Subsidiary Registrants are derived from the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust, as such, each are allocated their proportionate share of the assets discussed below.\nThe following table includes the target asset allocations by asset class at December 31, 2020, and the actual asset allocations for the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust.\nOther post-retirement assets\nDuke Energy's other post-retirement assets are comprised of Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts and 401(h) accounts held within the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust. Duke Energy's investment objective is to achieve sufficient returns, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefits for participants.\nThe following table presents target and actual asset allocations for the VEBA trusts at December 31, 2020.\nFair Value Measurements\nDuke Energy classifies recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements based on the fair value hierarchy as discussed in Note 16.\nValuation methods of the primary fair value measurements disclosed below are as follows:\nInvestments in equity securities\nInvestments in equity securities are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the reporting period. Principal active markets for equity prices include published exchanges such as NASDAQ and NYSE. Foreign equity prices are translated from their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market. Prices have not been adjusted to reflect after-hours market activity. The majority of investments in equity securities are valued using Level 1 measurements. When the price of an institutional commingled fund is unpublished, it is not categorized in the fair value hierarchy, even though the funds are readily available at the fair value.\nInvestments in corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities\nMost debt investments are valued based on a calculation using interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. Most debt valuations are Level 2 measurements. If the market for a particular fixed-income security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurement is Level 3. U.S. Treasury debt is typically Level 2.\nInvestments in short-term investment funds\nInvestments in short-term investment funds are valued at the net asset value of units held at year end and are readily redeemable at the measurement date. Investments in short-term investment funds with published prices are valued as Level 1. Investments in short-term investment funds with unpublished prices are valued as Level 2.\nDuke Energy Master Retirement Trust\nThe following tables provide the fair value measurement amounts for the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust qualified pension and other post-retirement assets.\n(a) Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont were allocated approximately 26%, 32%, 15%, 17%, 5%, 7% and 4%, respectively, of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust at December 31, 2020. Accordingly, all amounts included in the table above are allocable to the Subsidiary Registrants using these percentages.\n(b) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy.\n(a) Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont were allocated approximately 26%, 31%, 15%, 17%, 5%, 7% and 4%, respectively, of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust at December 31, 2019. Accordingly, all amounts included in the table above are allocable to the Subsidiary Registrants using these percentages.\n(b) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust qualified pension and other post-retirement assets at fair value on a recurring basis where the determination of fair value includes significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nOther post-retirement assets\nThe following tables provide the fair value measurement amounts for VEBA trust assets.\nEMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\nRetirement Savings Plan\nDuke Energy or its affiliates sponsor, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, employee savings plans that cover substantially all U.S. employees. Most employees participate in a matching contribution formula where Duke Energy provides a matching contribution generally equal to 100% of employee before-tax and Roth 401(k) contributions of up to 6% of eligible pay per pay period. Dividends on Duke Energy shares held by the savings plans are charged to retained earnings when declared and shares held in the plans are considered outstanding in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.\nFor new and rehired employees who are not eligible to participate in Duke Energy\u2019s defined benefit plans, an additional employer contribution of 4% of eligible pay per pay period, which is subject to a three-year vesting schedule, is provided to the employee\u2019s savings plan account. Certain Piedmont employees whose participation in a prior Piedmont defined benefit plan (that was frozen as of December 31, 2017) are eligible for employer transition credit contributions of 3% to 5% of eligible pay per period, for each pay period during the three-year period ending December 31, 2020.\nThe following table includes pretax employer matching contributions made by Duke Energy and expensed by the Subsidiary Registrants.\n23. INCOME TAXES\nConsolidated Appropriations Act\nOn December 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) into law. In addition to the CAA providing funding for government operations, it also provided tax provisions to assist with COVID-19 relief, including extending certain expiring tax provisions. The Company has reviewed the provisions of the CAA and has determined that there is no material impact on the 2020 financial statements as a result of the CAA being signed into law.\nCARES Act\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted. The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other provisions, the CARES Act accelerates the remaining AMT credit refund allowances resulting in taxpayers being able to immediately claim a refund in full for any AMT credit carryforwards and deferral of certain 2020 payroll taxes. In the third quarter of 2020, Duke Energy received $572 million related to these AMT credit carryforwards and $19 million of interest income. In addition, the Company has deferred approximately $117 million of payroll taxes, with 50% payable by December 31, 2021, and the remaining 50% payable by December 31, 2022. The other provisions within the CARES Act do not materially impact Duke Energy's income tax accounting. See Note 1 for information on COVID-19.\nTax Act\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Act into law. Among other provisions, the Tax Act lowered the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, limits interest deductions outside of regulated utility operations, requires the normalization of excess deferred taxes associated with property under the average rate assumption method as a prerequisite to qualifying for accelerated depreciation and repealed the federal manufacturing deduction. The Tax Act also repealed the corporate AMT and stipulates a refund of 50% of remaining AMT credit carryforwards (to the extent the credits exceed regular tax for the year) for tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020, with all remaining AMT credits to be refunded in tax year 2021.\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which provides guidance on accounting for the Tax Act\u2019s impact. SAB 118 provides a measurement period, which in no case should extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date, during which a company acting in good faith may complete the accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act under ASC Topic 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of the Tax Act in the reporting period in which the accounting under ASC Topic 740 is complete. To the extent that a company\u2019s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete, a company can determine a reasonable estimate for those effects and record a provisional estimate in the financial statements in the first reporting period in which a reasonable estimate can be determined.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the accounting for the effects of the Tax Act was complete. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Duke Energy recorded the following measurement period adjustments in accordance with SAB 118:\n\u2022Additional tax expense of $23 million related to the completion of the analysis of Duke Energy\u2019s existing regulatory liability related to deferred taxes;\n\u2022A $10 million tax benefit for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities primarily related to the guidance on bonus depreciation issued by the IRS in August 2018, affecting the computation of the Company's 2017 Federal income tax liability;\n\u2022Additional tax expense of $7 million related to the portion of the deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017, that represents nondeductible long-term incentives under the Tax Act\u2019s limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation; and\n\u2022During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company released the $76 million valuation allowance that it recorded in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of additional guidance published by the IRS that stated refundable AMT credits would not be subject to sequestration.\n\u2022The majority of Duke Energy\u2019s operations are regulated and it is expected that the Subsidiary Registrants will ultimately pass on the savings associated with the amount representing the remeasurement of deferred tax balances related to regulated operations to customers. For Duke Energy's regulated operations, where the reduction is expected to be returned to customers in future rates, the remeasurement has been deferred as a regulatory liability. During 2018, Duke Energy recorded an additional regulatory liability of $83 million, representing the revaluation of those deferred tax balances. The Subsidiary Registrants continue to respond to requests from regulators in various jurisdictions to determine the timing and magnitude of savings they will pass on to customers.\nIn addition, during 2018, Duke Energy reclassified $573 million of AMT credit carryforwards from noncurrent deferred tax liabilities to a current federal income tax receivable. In 2019, Duke Energy received a refund of $573 million related to AMT credit carryforwards based on the filing of Duke Energy's 2018 income tax return in 2019 and reclassified $286 million of AMT credits from noncurrent deferred tax liabilities to a current federal income tax receivable.\nIncome Tax Expense\nComponents of Income Tax Expense\n(a) Total deferred income taxes includes the generation of NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards of $20 million at Duke Energy Carolinas, $3 million at Duke Energy Progress, $8 million at Duke Energy Indiana, and $11 million at Piedmont. In addition, total deferred income taxes includes utilization of NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards of $39 million at Progress Energy, $30 million at Duke Energy Florida and $79 million at Duke Energy.\n(a) Total deferred income taxes includes the generation of tax credit carryforwards of $8 million at Duke Energy Carolinas. In addition, total deferred income taxes includes utilization of NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards of $243 million at Progress Energy, $35 million at Duke Energy Progress, $152 million at Duke Energy Florida, $25 million at Duke Energy Ohio, $60 million at Duke Energy Indiana, $90 million at Piedmont and $775 million at Duke Energy.\n(a) Includes benefits of NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards of $22 million at Duke Energy Carolinas, $293 million at Progress Energy, $59 million at Duke Energy Progress, $219 million at Duke Energy Florida, $17 million at Duke Energy Ohio, $21 million at Duke Energy Indiana and $39 million at Piedmont. In addition, total deferred income taxes includes utilization of NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards of $18 million at Duke Energy.\n(b) For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company has revised the December 31, 2017, estimates of the income tax effects of the Tax Act, in accordance with SAB 118. See the Statutory Rate Reconciliation section below for additional information on the Tax Act's impact on income tax expense .\nDuke Energy Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes\nStatutory Rate Reconciliation\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the actual tax expense from continuing operations.\n(a) For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company revised the December 31, 2017, estimates of the income tax effects of the Tax Act, in accordance with SAB 118. Amounts primarily include but are not limited to items that are excluded for ratemaking purposes related certain wholesale fixed-rate contracts, remeasurement of nonregulated net deferred tax liabilities, Federal NOLs, and valuation allowance on foreign tax credits.\nValuation allowances have been established for certain state NOL carryforwards and state income tax credits that reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will be realized on a more-likely-than-not basis. The net change in the total valuation allowance is included in State income tax, net of federal income tax effect, in the above tables.\nValuation allowances have been established for foreign tax credits that reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will be realized on a more-likely-than-not basis. The net change in the total valuation allowance is included in Tax Act in the above tables.\nDEFERRED TAXES\nNet Deferred Income Tax Liability Components\n(a) Primarily related to lease obligations and debt fair value adjustments.\nThe following table presents the expiration of tax credits and NOL carryforwards.\n(a) A valuation allowance of $4 million has been recorded on the Federal NOL carryforwards, as presented in the Net Deferred Income Tax Liability Components table.\n(b) A valuation allowance of $97 million has been recorded on the state NOL and attribute carryforwards, as presented in the Net Deferred Income Tax Liability Components table.\n(c) A valuation allowance of $12 million has been recorded on the foreign NOL carryforwards, as presented in the Net Deferred Income Tax Liability Components table.\n(d) A valuation allowance of $388 million has been recorded on the foreign tax credits, as presented in the Net Deferred Income Tax Liability Components table.\n(e) A valuation allowance of $85 million has been recorded on the Federal capital loss carryforward, as presented in the Net Deferred Income Tax Liability Components table.\n(f) Indefinite carryforward for Federal NOLs, and NOLs for states that have adopted the Tax Act's NOL provisions, generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.\n(a) Primarily related to finance lease obligations and debt fair value adjustments.\nUNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS\nThe following tables present changes to unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe following table includes additional information regarding the Duke Energy Registrants' unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2020. Duke Energy Registrants do not anticipate a material increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.\n(a) The Duke Energy Registrants are unable to estimate the specific amounts that would affect the ETR versus the regulatory liability.\nDuke Energy and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to U.S. federal examination for years before 2016. With few exceptions, Duke Energy and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to state, local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016.\n24. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES, NET\nThe components of Other income and expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations are as follows.\n25. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nFor information on subsequent events related to the sale of a minority interest in Duke Energy Indiana and regulatory matters, see Notes 1 and 3, respectively.\nIn February 2021, a severe winter storm impacted certain Commercial Renewables assets in Texas. Extreme weather conditions limited the ability for these solar and wind facilities to generate and sell electricity into the Electric Reliability Council of Texas market. The financial impact of the storm is estimated to be between approximately $75 million and $100 million on a pre-tax basis.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Duke Energy Registrants in the reports they file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms.\nDisclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Duke Energy Registrants in the reports they file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy Registrants have evaluated the effectiveness of their disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2020, and, based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance of compliance.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy Registrants have evaluated changes in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020, and have concluded no change has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with GAAP. Due to inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 management, including their Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the framework in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that its internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2020.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, Duke Energy\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of Duke Energy\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein. This report is not applicable to the Subsidiary Registrants as these companies are not accelerated or large accelerated filers.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Duke Energy Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Duke Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nFebruary 25, 2021",

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nThe following table shows information as of December 31, 2020, about securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights under Duke Energy's equity compensation plans, along with the weighted average exercise price of the outstanding options, warrants and rights and the number of securities remaining available for future issuance under the plans.\n(1) As of December 31, 2020, no options were outstanding under equity compensation plans.\n(2) Includes RSUs and performance shares (assuming the maximum payout level) granted under the Duke Energy Corporation 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as well as shares that could be payable with respect to certain compensation deferred under the Duke Energy Corporation Executive Savings Plan (Executive Savings Plan) or the Directors\u2019 Savings Plan.\n(3) Includes shares remaining available for issuance pursuant to stock awards under the Duke Energy Corporation 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan.\n(4) Includes shares that could be payable with respect to certain compensation deferred under the Executive Savings Plan or the Duke Energy Corporation Directors' Savings Plan (Directors' Savings Plan), each of which is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan described in more detail below.\n(5) The number of shares remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans not approved by security holders cannot be determined because it is based on the amount of future voluntary deferrals, if any, under the Executive Savings Plan and the Directors' Savings Plan.\nUnder the Executive Savings Plan, participants can elect to defer a portion of their base salary and short-term incentive compensation. Participants also receive a company matching contribution in excess of the contribution limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code under the Duke Energy Retirement Savings Plan, which is the 401(k) plan in which employees are generally eligible to participate. Eligible participants may also earn pay credits based on age and length of service on eligible earnings that exceed limited prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code.\nIn general, payments are made following termination of employment or death in the form of a lump sum or installments, as selected by the participant. Participants may direct the deemed investment of their accounts (with certain exceptions) among investment options available under the Duke Energy Retirement Savings Plan, including the Duke Energy Common Stock Fund. Participants may change their investment elections on a daily basis. Deferrals of equity awards are credited with earnings and losses based on the performance of the Duke Energy Common Stock Fund. The benefits payable under the plan are unfunded and subject to the claims of Duke Energy\u2019s creditors.\nUnder the Directors\u2019 Savings Plan, outside directors may elect to defer all or a portion of their annual compensation, generally consisting of retainers. Deferred amounts are credited to an unfunded account, the balance of which is adjusted for the performance of phantom investment options, including the Duke Energy Common Stock Fund, as elected by the director, and generally are paid when the director terminates his or her service from the Board of Directors.\nDuke Energy will provide additional information that is responsive to this Item 12 in its definitive proxy statement or in an amendment to this Annual Report not later than 120 days after the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report.
