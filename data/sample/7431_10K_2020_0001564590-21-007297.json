    "item_1": "ITEM 1.\nBUSINESS\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc. (\u201cAWI\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a Pennsylvania corporation incorporated in 1891. When we refer to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this report, we are referring to AWI and its subsidiaries.\nWe are a leading producer of ceiling systems for use in the construction and renovation of commercial and residential buildings. We design, manufacture and sell ceiling and wall systems (primarily mineral fiber, fiberglass wool, metal, wood, wood fiber, glass-reinforced-gypsum and felt) throughout the Americas.\nAs an Americas-based ceilings and walls company, we are focused on driving profitable topline growth by growing our core business and expanding into new, adjacent business categories and sectors. Our key strategic initiatives aim to align to these objectives and leverage our strengths. Our initiatives are designed to enable us to: (i) lead in innovation and launch new products; (ii) expand our portfolio of solutions and manufacturing capabilities through a pipeline of acquisitions, partnerships and alliances, as well as new programs focused on the sustainability of our products and operations; (iii) lead in solutions design; (iv) expand category and sector access within the commercial and residential construction markets; (v) build and deliver compelling value propositions; and (vi) optimize service to our customers.\nThrough our expanding architectural specialties offerings, bolstered by our recent acquisitions, our continuously evolving innovative core ceilings portfolio, including our Healthy Spaces products, Total Acoustics\u00ae solutions and Sustain\u00ae family of products; and our development of digitally enabled systems and tools, we are increasing our capabilities to sell into more spaces and sell more into every space.\nAcquisitions\nIn December 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity of Arktura LLC (\u201cArktura\u201d) and certain subsidiaries with operations in the United States and Argentina. Arktura is a designer and fabricator of metal and felt ceilings, walls, partitions and facades with one manufacturing facility based in Los Angeles, California.\nIn August 2020, we acquired the business and assets of Moz Designs, Inc. (\u201cMoz\u201d), based in Oakland, California. Moz is a designer and fabricator of custom architectural metal ceilings, walls, dividers and column covers for interior and exterior applications with one manufacturing facility.\nIn July 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of TURF Design, Inc. (\u201cTurf\u201d), with one manufacturing facility in Elgin, Illinois and a design center in Chicago, Illinois. Turf is a designer and manufacturer of acoustic felt ceilings and wall products.\nIn November 2019, we acquired the business and assets of MRK Industries, Inc. (\u201cMRK\u201d), based in Libertyville, Illinois. MRK is a manufacturer of specialty metal ceiling, wall and exterior solutions with one manufacturing facility.\nIn March 2019, we acquired the business and assets of Architectural Components Group, Inc. (\u201cACGI\u201d), based in Marshfield, Missouri. ACGI is a manufacturer of custom wood ceilings and walls with one manufacturing facility.\nIn August 2018, we acquired the business and assets of Steel Ceilings, Inc. (\u201cSteel Ceilings\u201d), based in Johnstown, Ohio. Steel Ceilings is a manufacturer of aluminum and stainless metal ceilings that include architectural, radiant and security solutions with one manufacturing facility.\nIn May 2018, we acquired the business and assets of Plasterform, Inc. (\u201cPlasterform\u201d), based in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Plasterform is a manufacturer of architectural cast ceilings, walls, facades, columns and moldings with one manufacturing facility.\nThe operations, assets and liabilities of these acquisitions are included in our Architectural Specialties segment.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn September 30, 2019, we completed the sale of certain subsidiaries comprising our businesses and operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (including Russia) (\u201cEMEA\u201d) and the Pacific Rim, including the corresponding businesses and operations conducted by Worthington Armstrong Venture (\u201cWAVE\u201d), our joint venture with Worthington Industries, Inc. (\u201cWorthington\u201d) in which AWI holds a 50% interest (collectively, the \u201cSale\u201d), to Knauf International GmbH (\u201cKnauf\u201d). The purchase price of $330.0 million was previously paid by Knauf to us during 2018 and was subject to certain post-closing adjustments for cash and debt as provided in the\nPurchase Agreement dated as of November 17, 2017, by and between us and Knauf (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d), including adjustments based on the economic impact of any required regulatory remedies and a working capital adjustment. During 2020, we remitted $25.9 million to WAVE for their remaining portion of the proceeds from Knauf. Also during 2020, WAVE paid each of AWI and Worthington dividends of $13.0 million relating to these payments. During the third quarter of 2020, we remitted $6.4 million to Knauf for working capital and other adjustments. In January 2021, we finalized the post-closing adjustments to purchase price related to certain pension liabilities assumed by Knauf in the Sale. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a $12.0 million loss primarily related to this purchase price adjustment, which is reflected within accounts payable and accrued expenses as of December 31, 2020.\nIn 2019, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement with Knauf for its benefit and the benefit of a buyer of certain businesses divested by Knauf, pursuant to which we provided certain transition technology, finance and information technology support services. The Transition Services Agreement expired in 2020. In connection with the closing of the Sale, we also entered into (i) a royalty-free intellectual property License Agreement with Knauf under which they, and the buyers of certain businesses divested by Knauf, license patents, trademarks and know-how from us for use in licensed territories in which the business was conducted prior to the Sale, and (ii) a Supply Agreement with Knauf under which the parties may continue to purchase certain products from each other following the closing of the Sale. WAVE also entered into similar agreements with Knauf for such purposes. The term of the granted licenses, with respect to each intellectual property right, extend until the expiration or abandonment of each such intellectual property right.\nThe EMEA and Pacific Rim segment historical financial results through September 30, 2019 have been reflected in AWI\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as discontinued operations for all periods presented, while the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations have been removed from AWI\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019.\nSee Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions and discontinued operations.\nMarkets\nWe are well positioned in the industry sectors and categories in which we operate, often holding a leadership position. Our products compete against mineral fiber and fiberglass products from other manufacturers, as well as drywall and a wide range of specialty ceiling products. We compete directly with other domestic and international suppliers of these products. The major markets in which we compete are:\nCommercial Construction. Our revenue opportunities come from new construction as well as renovation of existing buildings. Renovation work (also known as replacement/remodel) is estimated to represent the majority of the commercial market opportunity. Most of our revenue comes from the following sectors of commercial construction - office, education, transportation, healthcare and retail. We monitor U.S. construction starts and project activity. Our revenue from new construction can lag behind construction starts by as much as 24 months. We also monitor office vacancy rates, the Architecture Billings Index, state and local government spending, gross domestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d) and general employment levels, which can indicate movement in renovation and new construction opportunities. We believe that these statistics, taking into account the time-lag effect, provide a reasonable indication of our future revenue opportunity from commercial renovation and new construction. Additionally, we believe that customer preferences for product type, style, color, performance attributes (such as acoustics, sustainability and health attributes), availability, affordability and ease of installation also affect our revenue.\nIn our Mineral Fiber segment, we estimate that a majority of our commercial construction market sales are used for existing building renovation purposes by end-users of our products. In our Architectural Specialties segment, we estimate that a majority of our commercial market sales are used for new building construction by end-users of our products. The end-use of our products is based on management estimates as such information is not easily determinable.\nResidential Construction. We also sell mineral fiber products for use in single and multi-family housing. We estimate that existing home renovation work represents the majority of the residential construction market opportunity. Key U.S. statistics that indicate market opportunity include existing home sales (a key indicator for renovation opportunity), housing starts, housing completions, home prices, interest rates and consumer confidence.\nCustomers\nWe use our reputation, capabilities, service, innovation and brand recognition to develop long-standing relationships with our customers. We principally sell commercial products to building materials distributors, who re-sell our products to contractors, subcontractors\u2019 alliances, large architect and design firms, and major facility owners. We have important relationships with national\nhome centers such as Lowe\u2019s Companies, Inc. and The Home Depot, Inc., with wholesalers who re-sell our products to dealers who service builders, contractors and consumers, and also with architects and designers who specify products.\nIn 2020, approximately 70% of our consolidated net sales are to distributors. Sales to large home centers accounted for approximately 10% of our consolidated net sales. Our remaining sales are primarily to direct customers and retailers.\nGross sales to commercial distributors GMS Inc. and Foundation Building Materials, Inc. totaled $370.3 million and individually exceeded 10% of our consolidated gross sales in 2020. These sales were included within our Mineral Fiber and Architectural Specialties segments.\nWorking Capital\nWe produce goods for inventory and sell on credit to our customers. Generally, our distributors carry inventory as needed to meet local or rapid delivery requirements. We sell our products to select, pre-approved customers using customary trade terms that allow for payment in the future. These practices are typical within the industry.\nCompetition\nThe markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Principal attributes of competition include product performance, product styling, service and price. Competition comes from both domestic and international manufacturers. Additionally, some of our products compete with alternative products or finishing solutions, namely, drywall and exposed structure (also known as open plenum). Excess industry capacity exists for certain products, which tends to increase price competition. The following companies are our primary competitors:\nCertainTeed Corporation (a subsidiary of Saint-Gobain), Chicago Metallic Corporation (owned by Rockwool International A/S), Georgia-Pacific Corporation, Rockfon A/S (owned by Rockwool International A/S), USG Corporation (owned by Gebr. Knauf KG), Ceilings Plus (owned by USG Corporation), Rulon International, and 9Wood.\nRaw Materials\nWe purchase raw materials from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business. The principal raw materials include: clays, felt, fiberglass, perlite, pigment, recycled paper, starch, wood and wood fiber. We manufacture most of the production needs for mineral wool at one of our manufacturing facilities. Finally, we use aluminum and steel in the production of metal ceilings by us and by WAVE, our joint venture that manufactures ceiling grid.\nWe also purchase significant amounts of packaging materials and consume substantial amounts of energy, such as electricity and natural gas, and water.\nIn general, adequate supplies of raw materials are available to all of our operations. However, availability can change for a number of reasons, including environmental conditions, laws and regulations, shifts in demand by other industries competing for the same materials, transportation disruptions and/or business decisions made by, or events that affect, our suppliers. There is no assurance that these raw materials will remain in adequate supply to us.\nPrices for certain high usage raw materials can fluctuate dramatically. Cost increases for these materials can have a significant adverse impact on our manufacturing costs. Given the competitiveness of our markets, we may not be able to recover the increased manufacturing costs through increasing selling prices to our customers.\nSourced Products\nSome of the products that we sell are sourced from third parties. Our primary sourced products include specialty ceiling products. We purchase some of our sourced products from suppliers that are located outside of the U.S., primarily from Europe and the Pacific Rim. Sales of sourced products represented approximately 9% of our total consolidated revenue in 2020.\nIn general, we believe we have adequate supplies of sourced products. However, we cannot guarantee that the supply will remain adequate.\nSeasonality\nGenerally, our sales tend to be stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year due to more favorable weather conditions, customer business cycles and the timing of renovation and new construction. In comparison to the prior year, sales were weaker in the second through fourth quarters of 2020 due to reduced demand related to COVID-19. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Rights\nPatent protection is important to our business. Our competitive position has been enhanced by patents on products and processes developed or perfected within AWI or obtained through acquisitions and licenses. In addition, we benefit from our trade secrets for certain products and processes.\nPatent protection extends for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of a patent in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies. Although we consider that, in the aggregate, our patents, licenses and trade secrets constitute a valuable asset of material importance to our business, we do not believe we are materially dependent upon any single patent or trade secret, or any group of related patents or trade secrets.\nCertain of our trademarks, including without limitation, , Armstrong\u00ae, 24/7 Defend\u2122, ACOUSTIBuilt\u2122, AirAssure\u2122, Airtite\u00ae, Arktura\u00ae, Calla\u00ae, Cirrus\u00ae, Cortega\u00ae, DESIGNFlex\u00ae, Dune\u2122, Feltworks\u00ae, Humiguard\u00ae, Infusions\u00ae, InvisAcoustics\u2122, Kanopi\u2122, Lyra\u00ae, MetalWorks\u2122, Moz\u2122, Optima\u00ae, Plasterform\u2122, Soundscapes\u00ae, Sustain\u00ae, Tectum\u00ae, Total Acoustics\u00ae, Turf\u00ae, Ultima\u00ae, and WoodWorks\u00ae, are important to our business because of their significant brand name recognition. Registrations are generally for fixed, but renewable, terms.\nIn connection with the separation and distribution of our former flooring business into a separate publicly-traded company, Armstrong Flooring, Inc. (\u201cAFI\u201d), in 2016, we entered into several agreements with AFI that, together with a plan of division, provided for the separation and allocation of assets between AWI and AFI. These agreements include a Trademark License Agreement and a Transition Trademark License Agreement. Pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement, AWI provided AFI with a perpetual, royalty-free license to utilize the \u201cArmstrong\u201d trade name and logo. Pursuant to the Transition Trademark License Agreement, AFI provided us with a royalty-free license to utilize the \u201cInspiring Great Spaces\u201d tagline, logo and related color scheme, which expires December 31, 2021.\nIn connection with the closing of the Sale, we entered into a royalty-free intellectual property License Agreement with Knauf for its benefit (and, under sublicense, to the buyers of certain businesses divested by Knauf) under which they license certain patents, trademarks and know-how from us for use in certain licensed territories.\nWe review the carrying value of indefinite-lived trademarks at least annually for potential impairment. See the \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d section of Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nSustainability and Environmental Matters\nAs a leading building products manufacturer, we are committed to operating sustainably across all areas of our business. This commitment is reflected in our ongoing initiatives to design and develop sustainable ceiling and wall products and solutions for every space. Sustainability in our business reflects our mission to make a difference in the lives of people where they live, work, learn, heal and play. Sustainability is designed to support our strategic priorities, align with stakeholder interests, and be visible and measurable.\nOur sustainability function is organized around three program \u201cpillars\u201d: People, Planet and Product.\nUnder the People pillar of our program, we are broadly focused on increasing our engagement in the communities where we operate, evaluating our benefits and compensation structure for all levels of the organization, promoting and maintaining a diverse, talented and growing workforce, encouraging and protecting human rights, and creating a safe working environment for our employees.\nUnder the Planet pillar of our program, we are broadly focused on reducing our greenhouse gas footprint, reducing or recapturing water in our operations, and reducing waste in our operations. These efforts include our ceilings recycling program, which diverts reclaimed ceiling tiles from landfills, and our reduction of our environmental operating footprint. Additionally, we are committed to complying with all environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations.\nUnder the Product pillar of our program, we are broadly focused on ensuring our products are free of chemicals of concern, reducing our products\u2019 water and greenhouse gas footprint, and continuing to invest in solutions that meet customer demand for building products that align with their sustainability goals. We expect that there will be increased demand over time for products, systems and services that meet evolving regulatory and customer sustainability standards and preferences and decreased demand for products that produce significant greenhouse gas emissions. We also believe that our ability to continue to provide these products, systems and services to our customers, including through our Sustain\u00ae portfolio, will be necessary to maintain our competitive position in the marketplace.\nThe adoption of environmentally responsible building codes and standards such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (\u201cLEED\u201d) rating system established by the U.S. Green Building Council, has the potential to increase demand for products, systems and services that contribute to building sustainable spaces. Many of our products meet the requirements for the award of LEED credits, and we are continuing to develop new products, systems and services to address market demand for products that enable construction of buildings that require fewer natural resources to build, operate and maintain. Our competitors also have developed and introduced to the market products with an increased focus on sustainability.\nHuman Capital\nWorkforce Demographics. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had approximately 2,700 and 2,500 full time and part time employees, respectively. The increase in employees was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of Arktura, Moz and Turf during 2020. During 2020, our total voluntary and involuntary turnover rates were approximately 5% and 3%, respectively, for non-production employees and 12% and 6%, respectively, for production employees.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 59% of our approximately 1,300 production employees in the U.S. were represented by labor unions. Collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 500 employees at two U.S. plants will expire during 2021. We believe that our relations with our employees are constructive and positive.\nEmployee Health and Safety. Safety is a core value at Armstrong and our culture is committed to making safety a personal core value for every employee. Our overall goal is to eliminate workplace injuries. We promote and foster an environment of empowerment and sharing throughout the company at all levels and in all locations. We engage our employees on safety with a focus on risk identification and elimination and through various leading indicators. We track Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) recordable injuries and lost time rates by location monthly. We establish safety targets annually, which are tracked and reported to leadership monthly and reviewed with our Board of Directors.\nWe offer competitive health and wellness benefits to eligible employees and periodically conduct analyses of plan utilization to further tailor our employee benefits to meet their ongoing needs. In response to COVID-19, we continue to follow guidelines from governmental and local health authorities across our facilities and have implemented preventative measures that include working remotely, providing personal protective equipment, limiting group meetings, enhancing cleaning and sanitizing procedures, and social distancing. Employees who can meet our customer commitments remotely are doing so, and a significant portion of our workforce began teleworking in mid-March 2020 and were continuing to telework as of December 31, 2020. During 2020, we implemented an Emergency Paid Leave policy for all employees which expired on December 31, 2020. This policy granted additional paid time off for any employee impacted by COVID-19. We implemented a COVID Leave Program effective January 1, 2021 that continues to provide similar benefits for employees impacted by COVID-19.\nDiversity and Inclusion. We continue to take steps to expand our role as an employer that champions diversity and inclusion, as we believe it is a key to our future success. This commitment is most recently reflected in the goals of the People Pillar of our Sustainability program, which is being led by our VP Talent Sustainability, who was hired in 2020. We measure gender and racial/ethnic representation and are focusing on our incoming new hires to assist in increasing diversity within the company. In addition, we are committed to engaging in events and outreach that align with our goals to enhance our diversity and inclusion. Our strategy to grow our diversity over time includes (1) providing annual training to employees on diversity and inclusion topics, (2) demonstrating year over year improvement in the diversity of our organization measured by representation of female, minorities and veterans at every level of the organization, and (3) providing employees an annual opportunity to share their views on topics that matter to them.\nResearch & Development\nResearch and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) activities are important and necessary in helping us improve our products\u2019 competitiveness. Principal R&D functions include the development and improvement of products and manufacturing processes.\nLegal and Regulatory Proceedings\nRegulatory activities of particular importance to our operations include proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), and state Superfund and similar type environmental laws governing existing or potential environmental contamination at two domestically owned locations allegedly resulting from past industrial activity. We are one of several potentially responsible parties in these matters and have agreed to jointly fund required investigation, while preserving our defenses to the liability. We may also have rights of contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under applicable insurance policies.\nMost of our facilities are affected by various federal, state and local environmental requirements relating to the discharge of materials or the protection of the environment. We make expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable environmental requirements at each of our operating facilities. We have not experienced a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures or competitive position as a result of environmental control legislation and regulations.\nOn September 8, 2017, Roxul USA, Inc. (d/b/a Rockfon) (\u201cRockfon\u201d) filed litigation against us in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the \u201cCourt\u201d) alleging anticompetitive conduct seeking remedial measures and unspecified damages. Roxul USA, Inc. is a significant ceilings systems competitor with global headquarters in Europe and expanding operations in the Americas. On April 3, 2019, we entered into a confidential settlement agreement with Rockfon to fully resolve the litigation between us, and Rockfon filed a Stipulation of Dismissal with Prejudice (\u201cDismissal\u201d) with the Court. Pursuant to the Dismissal, Rockfon formally dismissed all claims it had against AWI with prejudice. All claims in the litigation have been fully and finally dismissed and released with AWI making a payment to Rockfon for its costs, expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees. Pursuant to the settlement, both parties acknowledged that (a) AWI denies all claims of wrongdoing and makes no admission of wrongdoing or of the truth of any of the claims or allegations contained in Rockfon\u2019s complaint or otherwise alleged in the litigation; (b) all AWI exclusive distribution locations (i.e., any location where a reseller has agreed to sell only AWI ceiling system products) will remain exclusive to AWI under their respective distribution agreements, and (c) in all other non-exclusive or \u201copen\u201d distribution locations, resellers are free to purchase and resell ceiling systems products of any manufacturer at their discretion. During 2019, we incurred $19.7 million of expenses in connection with the matter, primarily relating to legal and professional fees incurred by us in connection with the litigation, including expenses and attorney\u2019s fees paid under the settlement agreement. As a result of the settlement and Dismissal, we do not expect to incur additional future costs or expenses relating to the matter.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various other lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal matters that arise in the ordinary course of business, including matters involving our products, intellectual property, relationships with suppliers, relationships with distributors, relationships with competitors, employees and other matters. In connection with those matters, we may have rights of contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under applicable insurance policies. When applicable and appropriate, we will pursue coverage and recoveries under those policies, but are unable to predict the outcome of those demands. While complete assurance cannot be given to the outcome of any proceedings relating to these matters, we do not believe that any current claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nLiabilities of $1.2 million and $1.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, were recorded for environmental liabilities that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the probable liability could be made. See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Risk Factors in",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nSales fluctuations to and changes in our relationships with key customers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe loss, reduction, or fluctuation of sales to key customers, including independent distributors, or any adverse change in our business relationship with them, whether as a result of competition, industry consolidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nIf the availability of raw materials or energy decreases, or the costs increase, and we are unable to pass along increased costs, our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe availability and cost of raw materials, packaging materials, energy and sourced products are critical to our operations and our results of operations. For example, we use substantial quantities of natural gas and petroleum-based raw materials in our manufacturing operations. The cost of some of these items has been volatile in recent years and availability has been limited at times. We source some materials from a limited number of suppliers, which, among other things, increases the risk of unavailability. Limited availability could cause us to reformulate products or limit our production. Decreased access to raw materials and energy or significant increased cost to purchase these items and any corresponding inability to pass along such costs through price increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe performance of our WAVE joint venture is important to our financial results. Changes in the demand for, or quality of, WAVE products, or in the operational or financial performance of the WAVE joint venture, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Similarly, if there is a change with respect to our joint venture partner that adversely impacts its relationship with us, WAVE\u2019s performance could be adversely impacted.\nOur equity investment in our WAVE joint venture remains important to our financial results. WAVE\u2019s markets are highly competitive and changes in the demand for, or quality of, WAVE products, or in the operational or financial performance of the WAVE joint venture, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Similarly, the availability and cost of raw materials, packaging materials, energy and sourced products are critical to WAVE\u2019s operations and its results of operations.\nWe believe another important element in the success of this joint venture is the relationship with our partner, Worthington Industries, Inc. If there is a change in ownership, a change of control, a change in management or management philosophy, a change in business strategy or another event with respect to our partner that adversely impacts our relationship, WAVE\u2019s performance could be adversely impacted. In addition, our partner may have economic or business interests or goals that are different from or inconsistent with our interests or goals, which may impact our ability to influence or align WAVE\u2019s strategy and operations.\nFrom time to time, we engage in cost-saving and productivity initiatives. Any such initiatives may not achieve expected savings in our operating costs or improved operating results.\nWe aggressively look for ways to make our operations more efficient and effective. We may reduce, move, modify and expand our plants and operations, as well as our sourcing and supply chain arrangements, as needed, to control costs and improve productivity. Such actions involve substantial planning, often require capital investments and may result in charges for fixed asset impairments or obsolescence and substantial severance costs. Our ability to achieve cost savings and other benefits within expected time frames is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIncreased costs of labor, labor disputes, work stoppages or union organizing activity could delay or impede production and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nIncreased costs of labor, including the costs of employee benefits plans, labor disputes, work stoppages or union organizing activity could delay or impede production and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. As the majority of our manufacturing employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements, we often incur costs attributable to periodic renegotiation of those agreements, which may be difficult to project. We are also subject\nto the risk that strikes or other conflicts with organized personnel may arise or that we may become the subject of union organizing activity at our facilities that do not currently have union representation. Prolonged negotiations, conflicts or related activities could also lead to costly work stoppages and loss of productivity.\nRisks Related to Our Strategy\nWe may pursue strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances or other investments, which could create risks and present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs, any of which could have an adverse effect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe regularly evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances or other investments that we believe could complement, enhance or expand our current businesses or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. Any such strategic transaction involves a number of risks, including potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management, difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and business operations and infrastructure, and increasing or decreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. Strategic transactions could involve payment by us of a substantial amount of cash, assumption of liabilities and indemnification obligations, regulatory requirements, incurrence of a substantial amount of debt or issuance of a substantial amount of equity. Certain strategic opportunities may not result in the consummation of a transaction or may fail to realize the intended benefits and synergies. If we fail to identify, consummate and integrate our strategic transactions in a timely and cost-effective manner, our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not experience the anticipated benefits from our strategic initiatives, including investments in digitalization and new technology.\nWe continue to evaluate and may pursue strategic initiatives involving the development or utilization of new or innovative products, solutions and tools, as well as the expansion of our capabilities through digitalization. These initiatives are designed to grow revenue, improve profitability and increase shareholder value. Our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to successfully identify, execute and integrate these initiatives or if we are unable to complete these initiatives in a timely and efficient manner to realize competitive advantages and opportunities.\nRisks Related to Financial Matters\nNegative tax consequences can have an unanticipated effect on our financial results.\nWe are subject to the tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. The tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our operations and results is sometimes open to interpretation. Our income tax (benefit) expense and reported net (loss) income may fluctuate significantly, and may be materially different than forecasted or experienced in the past. Our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or tax liability could be adversely affected by changes in effective tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation, the results of examinations of previously filed tax returns, and ongoing assessments of our tax exposures.\nOur financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or tax liability could also be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We have substantial deferred tax assets related to U.S. domestic foreign tax credits (\u201cFTCs\u201d), capital loss carryforwards, and state net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d), which are available to reduce our U.S. income tax liability and to offset future state taxable income. However, our ability to utilize the current carrying value of these deferred tax assets may be impacted as a result of certain future events, such as changes in tax legislation and insufficient future taxable income prior to expiration of the FTCs, capital loss carryforwards, and NOLs.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to engage in activities that may be in our best long-term interests.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness include covenants that, among other things, may impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to engage in activities that may be in our best long-term interests. These covenants may restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated debt or make certain other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain acquisitions;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\ncreate liens on certain assets to secure debt.\nUnder the terms of our senior secured credit facility, we are required to maintain specified leverage and interest coverage ratios. Our ability to meet these ratios could be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure that we will meet them. A breach of any of the restrictive covenants or ratios would result in a default under the senior secured credit facility. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the senior secured credit facility may be able to elect to declare all outstanding borrowings under our facilities, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, or enforce their security interest. The lenders may also have the right in these circumstances to terminate commitments to provide further borrowings.\nOur indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate and invest in our business, execute on our strategic initiatives and declare dividends on our capital stock.\nOur level of indebtedness and degree of leverage could:\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, more able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrestrict our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect our credit ratings, if any.\nWe may also incur additional indebtedness, which could exacerbate the risks described above. In addition, to the extent that our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates, our sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations will increase.\nAny of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe require a significant amount of liquidity to fund our operations, and borrowing has increased our exposure to negative unforeseen events.\nOur liquidity needs vary throughout the year. If our business experiences materially negative unforeseen events, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our needs or maintain sufficient liquidity to operate and remain in compliance with our debt covenants, which could result in reduced or delayed planned capital expenditures and other investments and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nSignificant changes in factors and assumptions used to measure our defined benefit plan obligations, actual investment returns on pension assets and other factors could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.\nWe maintain significant pension and postretirement plans in the U.S. The recognition of costs and liabilities associated with these plans for financial reporting purposes is affected by assumptions made by management and used by actuaries engaged by us to calculate the benefit obligations and the expenses recognized for these plans.\nThe inputs used in developing the required estimates are calculated using a number of assumptions, which represent management\u2019s best estimate of the future. The assumptions that have the most significant impact on reported results are the discount rate, the estimated long-term return on plan assets for the funded plans, retirement rates, and mortality rates and, for postretirement plans, the estimated inflation in health care costs. These assumptions are generally updated annually.\nIn the aggregate, our U.S. pension plans were overfunded by $79.0 million as of December 31, 2020. Our unfunded U.S. postretirement plan liabilities were $81.4 million as of December 31, 2020. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our pension and postretirement plans obligations, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.\nIf the separation and distribution of Armstrong Flooring, Inc. (\u201cAFI\u201d) fails to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then AFI, AWI and AWI\u2019s shareholders could be subject to significant tax liability or tax indemnity obligations.\nOn April 1, 2016, we completed our previously announced separation of AFI by allocating the assets and liabilities related primarily to the Resilient Flooring and Wood Flooring segments to AFI and then distributing the common stock of AFI to our shareholders at a ratio of one share of AFI common stock for every two shares of AWI common stock. In connection with the distribution, we received an opinion from our special tax counsel, on the basis of certain facts, representations, covenants and assumptions set forth in such opinion, substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the separation and distribution should qualify as a transaction that generally is tax-free to us and our shareholders under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nNotwithstanding the tax opinion, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) could determine on audit that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations or covenants set forth in the tax opinion is not correct or has been violated, or that the distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the distribution, or if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinion. If the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable, the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend to each U.S. holder of our common shares who receives shares of AFI in connection with the spinoff for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and such shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, we and/or AFI could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities or tax indemnification obligations, whether under applicable law or the Tax Matters Agreement that we entered into with AFI, if it is ultimately determined that certain related transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are taxable.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe may be subject to liability under, and may make substantial future expenditures to comply with, environmental laws and regulations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe are actively involved in environmental investigation and remediation activities relating to two domestically owned locations allegedly resulting from past industrial activity, for which our ultimate liability may exceed the currently estimated and accrued amounts. See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our current environmental matters and the potential liabilities associated therewith. It is also possible that we could become subject to additional environmental matters and corresponding liabilities in the future.\nThe building materials industry has been subject to claims relating to raw materials such as silicates, polychlorinated biphenyl (\u201cPCB\u201d), polyvinyl chloride (\u201cPVC\u201d), formaldehyde, fire-retardants and claims relating to other issues such as mold and toxic fumes, as well as claims for incidents of catastrophic loss, such as building fires. We have not received any significant claims involving our raw materials or our product performance; however, product liability insurance coverage may not be available or adequate in all circumstances to cover claims that may arise in the future.\nIn addition, our operations are subject to various environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products, but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations. Our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future, and these increased costs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nAdverse results caused by regulatory actions, product claims, environmental claims and other litigation could be costly. Insurance coverage may not be available or adequate in all circumstances.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various claims and litigation. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources. While we strive to ensure that our products comply with applicable government regulatory standards and internal requirements, and that our products perform effectively and safely, customers from time to time could claim that our products do not meet warranty or contractual requirements, and users could claim to be harmed by use or misuse of our products. These claims could give rise to breach of contract, warranty or recall claims, or claims for negligence, product liability, strict liability, personal injury or property damage. They could also result in negative publicity.\nIn addition, claims and investigations may arise related to patent infringement, distributor relationships, commercial contracts, antitrust or competition law requirements, employment matters, employee benefits issues, and other compliance and regulatory matters, including anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters. While we have processes and policies designed to mitigate these risks and to investigate and address such claims as they arise, we cannot predict or, in some cases, control the costs to defend or resolve such claims.\nWe currently maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims. In the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels. In addition, the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. If any significant judgment or claim is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact. We cannot assure that the outcome of all current or future claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nIncreased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers, consumers and investors on sustainability issues, including those related to climate change, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.\nIncreased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers, consumers and investors on sustainability issues, including those related to climate change, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation. As climate change, land use, water use, deforestation, recyclability or recoverability of products, and other sustainability concerns become more prevalent, governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers, consumers and investors are increasingly focusing on these issues. This increased focus on environmental issues and sustainability may result in new or increased regulations and customer and investor demands that could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with any such regulations and demands.\nOur intellectual property rights may not provide meaningful commercial protection for our products or brands, which could adversely impact our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe rely on our proprietary intellectual property, including numerous patents and registered trademarks, as well as our licensed intellectual property to market, promote and sell our products. We monitor and protect against activities that might infringe, dilute, or otherwise harm our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property and rely on the patent, trademark and other laws of the U.S. and other countries. However, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization. In addition, the laws of some non-U.S. jurisdictions, particularly those of certain emerging markets, provide less protection for our proprietary rights than the laws of the U.S. and present greater risks of counterfeiting and other infringement. To the extent we cannot protect our intellectual property, unauthorized use and misuse of our intellectual property could harm our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our international operations in Canada and Latin America. Legislative, political, regulatory and economic volatility, as well as vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nA portion of our products move in international trade. Our international trade is subject to currency exchange fluctuations, trade regulations, import duties, logistics costs, delays and other related risks. Our international operations are also subject to various tax rates, credit risks in emerging markets, political risks, uncertain legal systems, and loss of sales to local competitors following currency devaluations in countries where we import products for sale. In addition, our international growth strategy depends, in part, on our ability to expand our operations in Canada and Latin America. However, some emerging markets have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than established markets. Similarly, our efforts to enhance the profitability or accelerate the growth of our operations in certain markets depends largely on the economic and geopolitical conditions in those local or regional markets.\nIn addition, in many countries outside of the United States, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws. These laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Failure to comply with these laws, as well as U.S. and foreign export and trading laws, could subject us to civil and criminal penalties. As we continue to expand our business, we may have difficulty anticipating and effectively managing these and other risks that our operations may face, which may adversely affect our business outside the United States and our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nRisks Related to General Economic and Other Factors\nUnstable market and economic conditions could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur business is influenced by market and economic conditions, including inflation, deflation, interest rates, availability and cost of capital, consumer spending rates, energy availability and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Volatility in financial markets and the continued softness or further deterioration of national and global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, including as follows:\n\u2022\nthe financial stability of our customers or suppliers may be compromised, which could result in additional bad debts for us or non-performance by suppliers;\n\u2022\ncommercial and residential consumers of our products may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or stagnation or further declines in income or asset values, which could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products;\n\u2022\nthe value of investments underlying our defined benefit pension plan may decline, which could result in negative plan investment performance and additional charges which may involve significant cash contributions to the plan, to meet obligations or regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\nour asset impairment assessments and underlying valuation assumptions may change, which could result from changes to estimates of future sales and cash flows that may lead to substantial impairment charges.\nContinued or sustained deterioration of economic conditions would likely exacerbate and prolong these adverse effects.\nOur business is dependent on commercial construction activity in North America. Downturns in construction activity could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur business has greater sales opportunities when construction activity is strong and, conversely, have fewer opportunities when such activity declines. The cyclical nature of commercial and residential construction activity, including construction activity funded by the public sector, tends to be influenced by prevailing economic conditions, including the rate of growth in gross domestic product, prevailing interest rates, government spending patterns, business, investor and consumer confidence and other factors beyond our control. Prolonged downturns in construction activity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur markets are highly competitive. Competition could reduce demand for our products or negatively affect our sales mix or price realization. Failure to compete effectively by meeting consumer preferences, developing and marketing innovative solutions, maintaining strong customer service and distribution relationships, and expanding our solutions capabilities and reach could adversely affect our results.\nOur customers consider product performance, product styling, customer service and price when deciding whether to purchase our products. Shifting consumer preference in our highly competitive markets, from acoustical solutions to other ceiling and wall products, for example, whether for performance or styling preferences or our inability to develop and offer new competitive performance features could have an adverse effect on our sales. Similarly, our ability to identify, protect and market new and innovative solutions is critical to our long-term growth strategy, namely to sell into more spaces and sell more solutions in every space. If our competitors offer discounts on certain products or provide new or alternative offerings that the marketplace perceives as more cost-effective, it could adversely affect our price realization. Any broad-based change to our price realization could materially impact our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nCustomer consolidation, and competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, and our potential failure to attract new customers in our markets, may negatively impact our operating margins and profitability.\nA number of our customers, including distributors and contractors, have consolidated in recent years and consolidation could continue. Further consolidation could impact margin growth and profitability as larger customers may realize certain operational and other benefits of scale. The economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing, and our customers' responses to those changes could impact our business. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe geographic concentration of our business could subject us to greater risk than our competitors and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nAs a result of the divestiture of our Europe, Middle East and Africa (including Russia) and Pacific Rim businesses to Knauf International GmbH, we primarily operate in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Our concentrated operations in the Americas could subject us to a greater degree of risk relative to our global, diversified competitors. We are particularly vulnerable to adverse events (including acts of terrorism, natural disasters, weather conditions, labor market disruptions and government actions) and economic conditions in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Adverse events or conditions in these geographic areas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur operating and information systems may experience a failure, a compromise of security, or a violation of data privacy laws or regulations, which could interrupt or damage our operations.\nIn the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit and store data on information systems, which are vulnerable to disruption and an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. These information systems may be disrupted or fail as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including events such as natural disasters, power loss, software \u201cbugs\u201d, hardware defects, hacking, computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other cyber-attacks. All of these risks are also applicable where we rely on outside vendors to provide services, which may operate in a cloud environment. We are dependent on third-party vendors to operate secure and reliable systems which may include data transfers over the internet. Any events which deny us use of vital operating or information systems may seriously disrupt our normal business operations.\nWe also compete through our use of information technology. We strive to provide customers with timely, accurate, easy-to-access information about product availability, orders and delivery status using state-of-the-art systems. While we have processes for short-term failures and disaster recovery capability, a prolonged disruption of systems or other failure to meet customers\u2019 expectations regarding the capabilities and reliability of our systems may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe could also experience a disruption of service or a compromise of our information security due to technical system flaws, clerical, data input or record-keeping errors, migration to new systems, or tampering or manipulation of our systems by employees or unauthorized third parties. Information security risks also exist with respect to the use of portable electronic devices, such as laptops and smartphones, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft. Any security breach or compromise of our information systems could significantly damage our reputation, cause the disclosure of confidential customer, employee, supplier or company information, including our intellectual property, and result in significant losses, litigation, fines and costs. The security measures we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to our information systems and data may not be sufficient to prevent breaches. The regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and privacy is evolving, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs.\nAdditionally, our key partners, distributors or suppliers could experience a compromise of their information security due to technical system flaws, clerical, data input or record-keeping errors, or tampering or manipulation of their respective systems by employees or third parties, which may have an impact on our commercial sales, vendor, partner or other relationships.\nWe cannot provide any guarantee of future cash dividend payments or that we will be able to repurchase our common stock pursuant to a share repurchase program.\nSince December 2018, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend on our common stock. The payment of any future cash dividends to our shareholders is not guaranteed and will depend on decisions that will be made by our Board of Directors based upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements and a determination that the declaration of cash dividends is in the best interest of our shareholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the payment of dividends.\nSince July 2016, our Board of Directors has approved share repurchases up to a total of $1,200.0 million. Repurchases under the program may be made through open market, block and privately-negotiated transactions, including Rule 10b5-1 plans, at times and in\namounts as management deems appropriate, subject to market and business conditions, regulatory requirements and other factors. The program does not obligate the company to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to repurchase our common stock and we may discontinue plans to repurchase common stock at any time.\nPublic health epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The extent to which COVID-19, or other public health epidemics, impacts our employees, operations, customers, suppliers and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic (and whether there is a resurgence or multiple resurgences in the future); government actions taken in response to the pandemic; the availability and distribution of vaccinations; the impact on construction activity; the effect on our customers demand for our ceiling and wall systems; our ability to manufacture and sell our products; and the ability of our customers to pay for our products. For example, while many of our products support life sustaining activities and essential construction, we, and certain of our customers or suppliers, may be impacted by state actions, orders and policies regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary closures of non-life sustaining businesses, shelter-in-place orders, and travel, social distancing and quarantine policies, the implementation and enforcement of which vary by individual U.S. states and by individual countries in the Americas. Any of these events could have material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.",

(\u201cAWI\u201d) is a Pennsylvania corporation incorporated in 1891.\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements, the accompanying notes, the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements and risk factors included in this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a leading producer of ceiling systems for use in the construction and renovation of commercial and residential buildings. We design, manufacture and sell ceiling and wall systems (primarily mineral fiber, fiberglass wool, metal, wood, wood fiber, glass-reinforced-gypsum and felt) throughout the Americas.\nCOVID-19\nThe impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our future consolidated results of operations is uncertain. We experienced a significant decrease in customer demand within both segments during the second through fourth quarters of 2020 due to COVID-19. Specifically, we noted delays in construction driven by temporary closures of non-life sustaining businesses, with the most significant impacts in major metropolitan areas impacted by COVID-19. We experienced less of a comparative decline in net sales during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2020, as construction resumed across many parts of the U.S. In response to COVID-19, we reduced capital expenditures and discretionary spending including compensation, travel and marketing expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2020, all of our manufacturing facilities were operational, excluding the St. Helens, Oregon facility which was idled prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. In an effort to operate safely and responsibly, we continue to follow guidelines from governmental and local health authorities across all our facilities and have implemented preventative measures that include working remotely, providing personal protective equipment, limiting group meetings, enhancing cleaning and sanitizing procedures, and social distancing.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we borrowed an additional $100.0 million from our revolving credit facility and $30.0 million from our accounts receivable securitization facility. During the second quarter of 2020, we repaid $65.0 million of the revolving credit facility borrowings and during the third quarter of 2020 we repaid $30.0 million in connection with the maturity of our accounts receivable securitization facility. Our share repurchase program was temporarily suspended in the first quarter of 2020 in response to uncertainties surrounding COVID-19. On October 21, 2020, we elected to restart the program and had $593.8 million remaining under our Board of Director\u2019s repurchase authorization as of December 31, 2020. We did not record any asset impairments, inventory charges or material bad debt reserves related to COVID-19 during 2020 but future events may require such charges. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the COVID-19 outbreak\u2019s impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAcquisitions\nIn December 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity of Arktura LLC (\u201cArktura\u201d) and certain subsidiaries with operations in the United States and Argentina. Arktura is a designer and fabricator of metal and felt ceilings, walls, partitions and facades with one manufacturing facility based in Los Angeles, California.\nIn August 2020, we acquired the business and assets of Moz Designs, Inc. (\u201cMoz\u201d), based in Oakland, California. Moz is a designer and fabricator of custom architectural metal ceilings, walls, dividers and column covers for interior and exterior applications with one manufacturing facility.\nIn July 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of TURF Design, Inc. (\u201cTurf\u201d), with one manufacturing facility in Elgin, Illinois and a design center in Chicago, Illinois. Turf is a designer and manufacturer of acoustic felt ceilings and wall products.\nIn November 2019, we acquired the business and assets of MRK Industries, Inc. (\u201cMRK\u201d), based in Libertyville, Illinois. MRK is a manufacturer of specialty metal ceiling, wall and exterior solutions with one manufacturing facility.\nIn March 2019, we acquired the business and assets of Architectural Components Group, Inc. (\u201cACGI\u201d), based in Marshfield, Missouri. ACGI is a manufacturer of custom wood ceilings and walls with one manufacturing facility.\nIn August 2018, we acquired the business and assets of Steel Ceilings, Inc. (\u201cSteel Ceilings\u201d), based in Johnstown, Ohio. Steel Ceilings is a manufacturer of aluminum and stainless metal ceilings that include architectural, radiant and security solutions with one manufacturing facility.\nIn May 2018, we acquired the business and assets of Plasterform, Inc. (\u201cPlasterform\u201d), based in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Plasterform is a manufacturer of architectural cast ceilings, walls, facades, columns and moldings with one manufacturing facility.\nThe operations, assets and liabilities of these acquisitions are included in our Architectural Specialties segment.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn September 30, 2019, we completed the sale of certain subsidiaries comprising our businesses and operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (including Russia) (\u201cEMEA\u201d) and the Pacific Rim, including the corresponding businesses and operations conducted by Worthington Armstrong Venture (\u201cWAVE\u201d), our joint venture with Worthington Industries, Inc. (\u201cWorthington\u201d) in which AWI holds a 50% interest (collectively, the \u201cSale\u201d), to Knauf International GmbH (\u201cKnauf\u201d). The purchase price of $330.0 million was previously paid by Knauf to us during 2018 and was subject to certain post-closing adjustments for cash and debt as provided in the Purchase Agreement dated as of November 17, 2017, by and between us and Knauf (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d), including adjustments based on the economic impact of any required regulatory remedies and a working capital adjustment. During 2020, we remitted $25.9 million, respectively, to WAVE for their remaining portion of the proceeds from Knauf. Also during 2020, WAVE paid each of AWI and Worthington dividends of $13.0 million relating to these payments. During the third quarter of 2020, we remitted $6.4 million to Knauf for working capital and other adjustments. In January 2021, we finalized the post-closing adjustments to purchase price related to certain pension liabilities assumed by Knauf in the Sale. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a $12.0 million loss primarily related to this purchase price adjustment, which is reflected within accounts payable and accrued expenses as of December 31, 2020.\nIn 2019, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement with Knauf for its benefit and the benefit of a buyer of certain businesses divested by Knauf, pursuant to which we provided certain transition technology, finance and information technology support services. The Transition Services Agreement expired in 2020. In connection with the closing of the Sale, we also entered into (i) a royalty-free intellectual property License Agreement with Knauf under which they, and the buyers of certain businesses divested by Knauf, license patents, trademarks and know-how from us for use in licensed territories in which the business was conducted prior to the Sale, and (ii) a Supply Agreement with Knauf under which the parties may continue to purchase certain products from each other following the closing of the Sale. WAVE also entered into similar agreements with Knauf for such purposes. The term of the granted licenses, with respect to each intellectual property right, extend until the expiration or abandonment of each such intellectual property right.\nThe EMEA and Pacific Rim segment historical financial results through September 30, 2019 have been reflected in AWI\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as discontinued operations for all periods presented, while the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations have been removed from AWI\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019.\nSee Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions and discontinued operations.\nManufacturing Plants\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 16 manufacturing plants in two countries, with 14 plants located within the U.S., which included our St. Helens, Oregon mineral fiber manufacturing facility, which closed in the second quarter of 2018. We have two plants in Canada. During 2020, as part of our acquisition of Turf, we acquired a plant in Illinois and, as part of acquisitions of Moz and Arktura, we acquired two additional plants in California. During 2020, we sold our idled plant in China, which had been classified as an asset held for sale.\nWAVE operates six additional plants in the U.S. to produce suspension system (grid) products, which we use and sell in our ceiling systems.\nReportable Segments\nOur operating segments are as follows: Mineral Fiber, Architectural Specialties and Unallocated Corporate.\nMineral Fiber - produces suspended mineral fiber and soft fiber ceiling systems for use in commercial and residential settings. Products offer various performance attributes such as acoustical control, rated fire protection, aesthetic appeal and health attributes. Commercial ceiling products are sold to resale distributors and to ceiling systems contractors. Residential ceiling products are sold\nprimarily to wholesalers and retailers (including large home centers). The Mineral Fiber segment also includes the results of WAVE, which manufactures and sells suspension system (grid) products and ceiling component products that are invoiced by both AWI and WAVE. Segment results relating to WAVE consist primarily of equity earnings and reflect our 50% equity interest in the joint venture. Ceiling component products consist of ceiling perimeters and trim, in addition to grid products that support drywall ceiling systems. To a lesser extent, however, in some geographies and for some customers, WAVE sells its suspension systems products to AWI for resale to customers. Mineral Fiber segment results reflect those sales transactions. The Mineral Fiber segment also includes all assets and liabilities not specifically allocated to our Architectural Specialties or Unallocated Corporate segment, including all property and related depreciation associated with our Lancaster, PA headquarters. Operating results for the Mineral Fiber segment include a significant majority of allocated Corporate administrative expenses that represent a reasonable allocation of general services to support its operations.\nArchitectural Specialties - produces and sources ceilings and walls for use in commercial settings. Products are available in numerous materials, such as metal and wood, in addition to various colors, shapes and designs. Products offer various performance attributes such as acoustical control, rated fire protection and aesthetic appeal. We sell standard and customized products, and a portion of our Architectural Specialties revenues are derived from sourced products. Architectural Specialties products are sold primarily to resale distributors and ceiling systems contractors. The majority of revenues are project driven, which can lead to more volatile sales patterns due to project scheduling uncertainty. Operating results for the Architectural Specialties segment include a portion of allocated Corporate administrative expenses that represent a reasonable allocation of general services to support its operations.\nUnallocated Corporate - includes assets, liabilities, income and expenses that have not been allocated to our other business segments and consists of: cash and cash equivalents, the net funded status of our U.S. Retirement Income Plan (\u201cRIP\u201d), the estimated fair value of interest rate swap contracts, outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility and income tax balances. Our Unallocated Corporate segment also includes all assets, liabilities, income and expenses formerly reported in our EMEA and Pacific Rim segments that were not included in the Sale.\nFactors Affecting Revenues\nFor information on our segments\u2019 2020 net sales by geography, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. For information on our segments\u2019 2020 net sales disaggregated by major customer groups, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nMarkets. We compete in the commercial and residential construction markets. We closely monitor publicly available macroeconomic trends that provide insight into commercial and residential market activity, including GDP, office vacancy rates, the Architecture Billings Index, new commercial construction starts, state and local government spending, corporate profits and retail sales.\nWe noted several factors and trends within our markets that directly affected our business performance during 2020, most importantly the aforementioned decrease in demand within both segments as a result of COVID-19. During 2020, we experienced an $87 million reduction in volumes compared to 2019. Revenues for our Architectural Specialties segment were also positively impacted by our 2019 acquisitions of ACGI and MRK (collectively, the \u201c2019 Acquisitions\u201d) and our 2020 acquisitions of Turf, Moz and Arktura (collectively, the \u201c2020 Acquisitions\u201d). The following table presents the impact of the 2019 Acquisitions and the 2020 Acquisitions on our Architectural Specialties segment\u2019s net sales (dollar amounts in millions):\nAverage Unit Value. We periodically modify sales prices of our products due to changes in costs for raw materials and energy, market conditions and the competitive environment. In certain cases, realized price increases are less than the announced price increases because of project pricing, competitive reactions and changing market conditions. We also offer a wide assortment of products that are differentiated by style, design and performance attributes. Pricing and margins for products within the assortment vary. In addition, changes in the relative quantity of products purchased at different price points can impact year-to-year comparisons of net sales and operating income. Within our Mineral Fiber segment, we focus on improving sales dollars per unit sold, or average unit value (\u201cAUV\u201d), as a measure that accounts for the varying assortment of products impacting our revenues. We estimate that unfavorable AUV decreased our total consolidated net sales for 2020 by approximately $14 million compared to 2019. See Results of Operations for further information. Our Architectural Specialties segment generates revenues that are generally earned based on individual contracts that include a mix of products, both manufactured by us and sourced from third parties that vary by project. As such, we do not track AUV performance for this segment, but rather attribute most changes in sales to volume.\nSeasonality. Historically, our sales tend to be stronger in the second and the third quarters of our fiscal year due to more favorable weather conditions, customer business cycles and the timing of renovation and new construction. In comparison to the prior year, sales were weaker in the second through fourth quarters of 2020 due to reduced demand related to COVID-19.\nFactors Affecting Operating Costs\nOperating Expenses. Our operating expenses are comprised of direct production costs (principally raw materials, labor and energy), manufacturing overhead costs, freight, costs to purchase sourced products and selling, general, and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expenses.\nOur largest raw material expenditures are for aluminum, clays, felt, fiberglass, perlite, pigment, recycled paper, starch, steel, wood and wood fiber. We manufacture most of the production needs for mineral wool at one of our manufacturing facilities. Natural gas and packaging materials are also significant input costs. Fluctuations in the prices of these inputs are generally beyond our control and have a direct impact on our financial results. In 2020, lower costs for raw materials and energy positively impacted operating income by $3 million, compared to 2019.\n2020 Acquisition-Related Expenses\nIn connection with the 2020 Acquisitions, we incurred certain acquisition-related expenses in 2020, summarized as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe deferred revenue, backlog and inventory amounts reflect the post-acquisition expense associated with recording these liabilities and assets at fair value as part of purchase accounting. The estimated fair value of contingent consideration for Moz and Turf is remeasured at each reporting period. Expenses related to the deferred cash and restricted stock awards for Arktura\u2019s former owners and employees will be recorded over their respective service and vesting periods, as such payments are subject to the awardees\u2019 continued employment with AWI. Purchase accounting expenses related to depreciation of fixed asset fair value adjustments and certain intangible asset amortization expenses have been excluded from the table above. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of our Amendment No. 1 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nUnless otherwise indicated, net sales in these results of operations are reported based upon the AWI location where the sale was made. Please refer to Notes 3 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and additional financial information related to discontinued operations.\n2020 COMPARED TO 2019\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nConsolidated net sales decreased 9.7% due to lower volumes of $87 million and unfavorable AUV of $14 million. Mineral Fiber net sales decreased by $100 million and Architectural Specialties net sales decreased by $1 million. As previously noted, decreases in volumes for both our Mineral Fiber and Architectural Specialties segments were a result of lower market demand due to COVID-19, partially offset by the impact of our 2020 Acquisitions and 2019 Acquisitions in the Architectural Specialties segment. We experienced less of a comparative decline in net sales during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2020, with sequential improvement in each quarter.\nCost of goods sold was 64.4% of net sales in 2020, compared to 61.9% in 2019. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales in comparison to 2019 was primarily due to unfavorable AUV and the impact of the 2020 Acquisitions and 2019 Acquisitions, partially offset by improved manufacturing productivity and cost reduction actions. The unfavorable AUV was partially driven by lower mix due to regional weakness in major metropolitan areas and due to changes in sales by customer group, both of which were impacted by COVID-19.\nSG&A expenses in 2020 were $163.3 million, or 17.4% of net sales, compared to $174.3 million, or 16.8% of net sales, in 2019. The decrease in SG&A expenses was due to a $20 million decrease in legal and professional fees, driven by expenses and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the first quarter of 2019 under a settlement agreement with Roxul, USA, Inc. (\u201cRockfon\u201d), a $7 million reduction related to higher environmental insurance settlements, net of charges, a $6 million reduction in incentive-based compensation expenses and a $5 million reduction in travel expense. These decreases in SG&A expenses were partially offset by a $10 million charitable endowment level funding to the Armstrong Foundation, a $9 million increase in SG&A expenses due to the impact of the 2020 Acquisitions and 2019 Acquisitions, including intangible asset amortization, and a $9 million increase in business development costs and investments in digitally enabled systems and tools.\nThe gain related to the sale of fixed and intangible assets was due to the sale of our idled mineral fiber plant in China, which was reported with our Unallocated Corporate segment.\nEquity earnings from our WAVE joint venture were $64.0 million in 2020, compared to $96.6 million in 2019. Consistent with our results, demand for WAVE\u2019s products were significantly impacted by COVID-19. The decrease in WAVE earnings was primarily related to lower volumes and unfavorable AUV and an increase in selling and administrative charges from AWI and Worthington Industries, Inc., partially offset by lower steel costs. Also contributing to the decrease in equity earnings was a $21 million increase in WAVE equity earnings in the third quarter of 2019, representing our 50% share of WAVE\u2019s gain on sale of its discontinued European and Pacific Rim businesses, net of a $4 million write-off related to our WAVE fresh-start reporting for customer relationships and developed technology intangible assets. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nInterest expense was $24.1 million in 2020, compared to $38.4 million in 2019. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower borrowings and decreases in LIBOR. Also impacting the decrease in interest expense was a lower spread on our borrowings and the write-off of unamortized debt financing cost in 2019, both of which were a result of the refinancing of our credit facility on September 30, 2019.\nOther non-operating expense, net, was $357.4 million in 2020, compared to $20.4 million of income in 2019. The increase in expense was primarily related to the $374.4 million settlement loss and the $2.0 million special termination benefit charge, both related to our RIP. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIncome tax benefit was $42.6 million in 2020, compared to $57.1 million of income tax expense in 2019, primarily driven by the effects of our first quarter 2020 pension settlement. The effective tax rate for 2020 was 33.6% as compared to a rate of 19.1% for 2019. In comparison to the statutory rate, the effective tax rate for 2020 was most significantly increased by the pre-tax benefits recognized on the sale of our mineral fiber plant in China. In comparison to the statutory rate, the effective tax rate for 2019 was most significantly impacted by the benefits related to WAVE\u2019s gain on sale of its EMEA and Pacific Rim businesses and statute closures.\nTotal other comprehensive income (\u201cOCI\u201d) was $266.8 million in 2020, compared to $83.4 million in 2019. The change in OCI was primarily driven by pension and postretirement adjustments, primarily a $278.6 million settlement loss, net of taxes, related to our\nRIP, partially offset by $6.9 million of foreign currency translation adjustments that were reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) upon the sale of our idled mineral fiber plant in China and the absence of $80.2 million of foreign currency translation adjustments that were reclassified out of AOCI concurrent with the Sale in third quarter of 2019. Pension and postretirement adjustments represent the amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. Foreign currency translation adjustments represent the change in the U.S. dollar value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Also impacting the change in OCI in both periods were derivative gains/losses. Derivative gain/loss represents the mark-to-market value adjustments of our derivative assets and liabilities and the recognition of gains and losses previously deferred in OCI.\nREPORTABLE SEGMENT RESULTS\nMineral Fiber\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nNet sales decreased due to lower volumes of $89 million and unfavorable AUV of $12 million. The decreases in volumes were driven by a significant decrease in demand due to COVID-19. The unfavorable AUV was partially driven by lower mix due to regional weakness in major metropolitan areas and due to changes in sales by customer group, both of which were impacted by COVID-19.\nOperating income decreased primarily due to a $63 million negative impact due to lower volumes, a $33 million reduction in WAVE equity earnings, a $22 million impact from lower AUV, a $10 million charitable endowment level funding to the Armstrong Foundation and a $9 million increase in business development costs and investments in digitally enabled systems and tools. Partially offsetting these decreases to operating income was a $29 million reduction in manufacturing costs, a $20 million decrease in legal and professional fees incurred in 2019 under a settlement agreement with Rockfon, a $7 million reduction related to higher environmental insurance settlements, net of charges, a $6 million reduction in incentive-based compensation expenses and a $4 million reduction in travel expense.\nArchitectural Specialties\n(dollar amounts in millions)\nNet sales decreased $1 million and were negatively impacted by a reduction in demand across almost all product categories and geographies as a result of COVID-19. Net sales in 2020 increased by $23 million due to the impact of the 2020 Acquisitions and 2019 Acquisitions.\nOperating income decreased due to the impact of lower sales, excluding the impact of the 2020 Acquisitions and 2019 Acquisitions. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was an additional $2 million of amortization expense related to the 2020 Acquisitions and the 2019 Acquisitions.\nUnallocated Corporate\nUnallocated Corporate operating income was $14 million in 2020 compared to $8 million of operating loss in 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the $21 million gain related to the sale of our idled mineral fiber plant in China. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nCash Flow\nThe discussion that follows includes cash flows related to discontinued operations in 2019, primarily operations sold in the Sale.\nOperating activities for 2020 provided $218.8 million of cash, compared to $182.7 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to lower tax payments and positive working capital changes, primarily receivables and accounts payable, partially offset by lower cash earnings.\nNet cash used for investing activities was $141.1 million for 2020, compared to $89.1 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions and the remittance of the remaining portion of Knauf proceeds to WAVE in 2020, partially offset by lower payments to Knauf, proceeds from the sale of our idled mineral fiber plant in China in 2020 and lower purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $13.5 million in 2020, compared to $384.9 million of cash used in 2019. The favorable change of cash was primarily due to decreased debt payments as a result of our September 2019 debt refinancing and lower repurchases of outstanding common stock.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity needs for operations vary throughout the year. We retain lines of credit to facilitate our seasonal cash flow needs, since cash flow is generally lower during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year.\nWe have a $1,000.0 million variable rate senior credit facility, which is composed of a $500.0 million revolving credit facility (with a $150.0 million sublimit for letters of credit) and a $500.0 million Term Loan A. The revolving credit facility and Term Loan A are currently priced at 1.50% over LIBOR. The senior credit facility also has a $25.0 million letter of credit facility, also known as our bi-lateral facility. The revolving credit facility and Term Loan A mature in September 2024. The $1,000.0 million senior credit facility is secured by the capital stock of material U.S. subsidiaries and a pledge of 65% of the stock of our material first-tier foreign subsidiary in Canada. The unpaid balances of the revolving credit facility and Term Loan A may be prepaid without penalty at the maturity of their respective interest reset periods. Any principal amounts paid on the Term Loan A may not be re-borrowed.\nAs of December 31, 2020, total borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility were $225.0 million under the revolving credit facility and $493.7 million under Term Loan A.\nThe senior credit facility includes two financial covenants that require the ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) to consolidated cash interest expense minus cash consolidated interest income to be greater than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0 and requires the ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness, minus AWI and domestic subsidiary unrestricted cash and cash equivalents up to $100 million, to EBITDA to be less than or equal to 3.75 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants of the senior credit facility.\nThe Term Loan A is currently priced on a variable interest rate basis. The following table summarizes our interest rate swaps (dollar amounts in millions):\nUnder the terms of the November 2016 swap maturing in 2021, we receive 3-month LIBOR and pay a fixed rate over the hedged period, in addition to a basis rate swap to convert the floating rate risk under our November 2016 swap from 3-month LIBOR to 1-month LIBOR. As a result, we receive 1-month LIBOR and pay a fixed rate over the hedged period.\nUnder the terms of the November 2018 swap maturing in 2023, we pay a fixed rate over the hedged amount and receive a 1-month LIBOR. This is inclusive of a 0% floor.\nUnder the terms of the forward starting November 2018 swap maturing in 2025, we will pay a fixed rate monthly and receive 1-month LIBOR. This is inclusive of a 0% floor.\nUnder the terms of the March 2020 swap maturing in 2022, we pay a fixed rate over the hedged amount and receive 1-month LIBOR. This is inclusive of a 0% floor.\nUnder the terms of the forward starting March 2020 swaps maturing in 2024, we will pay a fixed rate monthly and receive 1-month LIBOR. These are inclusive of a 0% floor.\nThese swaps are designated as cash flow hedges against changes in LIBOR for a portion of our variable rate debt.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $136.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $123.7 million in the U.S and $13.2 million in various foreign jurisdictions, primarily Canada.\nDuring 2020, we borrowed and subsequently repaid $30.0 million under our Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility with the Bank of Nova Scotia (the \u201cfunding entity\u201d) which matured in September 2020. Interest on borrowings under this amended facility was calculated at a 90-day commercial paper rate. Under this facility, we sold accounts receivables to Armstrong Receivables Company, LLC (\u201cARC\u201d), a Delaware entity that is consolidated in these financial statements. ARC is a 100% wholly owned single member LLC special purpose entity created specifically for this transaction; therefore, any receivables sold to ARC were not available to the general creditors of AWI. ARC used this facility to borrow cash or issue letters of credit. When ARC borrowed cash under this facility, ARC sold an undivided percentage ownership interest in the purchased accounts receivables to the funding entity. We had the unilateral right to repurchase the funding entity\u2019s purchased interest in the accounts receivables and, as a result, borrowings under this facility were reported as debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Borrowings under this facility were obligations of ARC and not AWI. ARC contracted with and paid a servicing fee to AWI to manage, collect and service the purchased accounts receivables. All new receivables under the program were continuously purchased by ARC with the proceeds from collections of receivables previously purchased.\nWe utilize lines of credit and other commercial commitments in order to ensure that adequate funds are available to meet operating requirements. Letters of credit are currently arranged through our revolving credit facility and our bi-lateral facility. Letters of credit may be issued to third party suppliers, insurance and financial institutions and typically can only be drawn upon in the event of AWI\u2019s failure to pay its obligations to the beneficiary. The following table presents details related to our letters of credit facilities (dollar amounts in millions):\nThe table below reflects future payments of long-term debt, excluding $3.2 million of unamortized debt financing costs, and the related interest payments, which are projected based on market-based interest rate swap curves (dollar amounts in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $136.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $275.0 million available under our revolving credit facility. We believe cash on hand and cash generated from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facility, will be adequate to address our near-term liquidity needs based on current expectations of our business operations, capital expenditures and scheduled payment of debt obligations. In 2021, we expect to spend approximately $75.0 million to $80.0 million on capital expenditures and approximately $40.0 million on dividends. The impacts of COVID-19 could create volatility in financial markets which may impact the terms under which we access capital. We continue to evaluate reductions in discretionary spending, capital expenditures and other costs.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an on-going basis, using relevant internal and external information. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results may differ from what was estimated and could have a significant impact on the financial statements.\nWe have identified the following as our critical accounting estimates. We have discussed these critical accounting estimates with our Audit Committee.\nU.S. Pension Credit and Postretirement Benefit Costs - We maintain significant pension and postretirement plans in the U.S. Our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. These valuations are calculated using a number of assumptions, which represent management\u2019s best estimate of the future. The assumptions that have the most significant impact on reported results are the discount rate, the estimated long-term return on plan assets and the estimated inflation in health care costs. These assumptions are generally updated annually.\nManagement utilizes the Aon Hewitt AA only above median yield curve, which is a hypothetical AA yield curve comprised of a series of annualized individual discount rates, as the primary basis for determining discount rates. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we assumed discount rates of 2.68% and 3.16%, respectively, for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we assumed a discount rates of 2.37% and 3.14%, respectively, for the U.S. postretirement plan. The effects of the change in discount rate will be amortized into earnings as described below. Absent any other changes, a one-quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rates for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans would not have a material impact on 2021 operating or non-operating income.\nWe manage two U.S. defined benefit pension plans, our RIP, which is a qualified funded plan, and a nonqualified unfunded plan. For the RIP, the expected long-term return on plan assets represents a long-term view of the future estimated investment return on plan assets. This estimate is determined based on the target allocation of plan assets among asset classes and input from investment professionals on the expected performance of the asset classes over 10 to 30 years. Historical asset returns are monitored and considered when we develop our expected long-term return on plan assets. An incremental component is added for the expected return from active management based on historical information obtained from the plan\u2019s investment consultants. These forecasted gross returns are reduced by estimated management fees and expenses. Over the 10-year period ended December 31, 2020, the historical annualized return was approximately 7.6% compared to an average expected return of 6.1%. The actual gain on plan assets incurred for 2020 was 9.6%, net of fees. The difference between the actual and expected rate of return on plan assets will be amortized into earnings as described below.\nThe expected long-term return on plan assets used in determining our 2020 U.S. pension cost was 5.25%. We have assumed a return on plan assets for 2021 of 3.25% as a result of a more conservative asset allocation. The 2021 expected return on assets was calculated in a manner consistent with 2020. A one-quarter percentage point increase or decrease in this assumption would not have a material impact on 2021 non-operating income.\nContributions to the unfunded pension plan were $3.1 million in 2020 and were made on a monthly basis to fund benefit payments. We estimate the 2021 contributions will be approximately $2.9 million. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nThe estimated inflation in health care costs represents a 5-10 year view of the expected inflation in our postretirement health care costs. We separately estimate expected health care cost increases for pre-65 retirees and post-65 retirees due to the influence of Medicare coverage at age 65, as illustrated below:\nThe difference between the actual and expected health care costs is amortized into earnings as described below. As of December 31, 2020, health care cost increases are estimated to decrease ratably until 2027, after which they are estimated to be constant at 4.50%. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nActual results that differ from our various pension and postretirement plan estimates are captured as actuarial gains/losses. When certain thresholds are met, the gains and losses are amortized into future earnings over the remaining life expectancy of participants. Changes in assumptions could have significant effects on earnings in future years.\nTotal net actuarial losses related to our U.S. pension benefit plans as of December 31, 2020 decreased by $398.1 million in 2020 primarily due to a $374.4 million settlement loss related to the transfer of certain benefit obligations of our RIP, better than expected return on assets, an annuity premium gain in the RIP and an experience gain in the RBEP, partially offset by a 48-basis point decrease in the discount rate. The $398.1 million actuarial gain impacting our U.S. pension plans is reflected as a component of other comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income along with actuarial gains and losses from our foreign pension plan and our U.S. postretirement benefit plan.\nIncome Taxes - Our effective tax rate is primarily determined based on our pre-tax income, statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets are also recorded for net operating losses (\u201cNOL\u201d), capital loss carryforwards, and foreign tax credit (\u201cFTC\u201d) carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have recorded valuation allowances totaling $79.4 million for various federal and state deferred tax assets. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowances based on our best available projections, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future or if actual results differ from our projections, we may be required to adjust our valuation allowances accordingly. Such adjustments could be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs further described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020 includes deferred income tax assets of $163.8 million. Included in this amount are deferred federal income tax assets for FTC carryforwards of $17.7 million, federal and state capital loss carryforwards of $19.3 million, and state NOL deferred income tax assets of $48.7 million. We have established valuation allowances in the amount of $79.4 million consisting of $17.7 million for federal deferred tax assets related to FTC carryovers, $42.4 million for state deferred tax assets, primarily operating loss carryovers, and $19.3 million for federal and state deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryovers. Inherent in determining our effective tax rate are judgments regarding business plans and expectations about future operations. These judgments include the amount and geographic mix of future taxable income, the amount of foreign source income, limitations on usage of NOL carryforwards, the impact of ongoing or potential tax audits, and other future tax consequences.\nWe estimate we will need to generate future U.S. taxable income of approximately $612.3 million for state income tax purposes during the respective realization periods (ranging from 2021 to 2040) to be able to fully realize the net state NOL deferred income tax assets.\nOur ability to utilize deferred tax assets may be impacted by certain future events, such as changes in tax legislation and insufficient future taxable income prior to expiration of certain deferred tax assets.\nImpairments of Long-Lived Tangible, Intangible Assets and Goodwill - Our indefinite-lived assets include goodwill and other intangibles, primarily trademarks and brand names. Those trademarks and brand names are integral to our corporate identity and expected to contribute indefinitely to our corporate cash flows. Accordingly, they have been assigned an indefinite life. We conduct our annual impairment tests for these indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill during the fourth quarter. These assets undergo more frequent tests if an indication of possible impairment exists. We conduct impairment tests for tangible assets and definite-lived intangible assets when indicators of impairment exist for the asset group, such as operating losses and/or negative cash flows.\nThe principal assumptions used in our impairment tests for definite-lived intangible assets is operating profit adjusted for depreciation and amortization and, if required to estimate the fair value, the discount rate. The principal assumptions used in our impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets include revenue growth rates, discount rate and royalty rate. The principal assumptions utilized in our impairment tests for goodwill include after-tax cash flows growth rates and discount rate. Revenue growth rates, after-tax cash flows growth rates and operating profit assumptions are derived from those used in our operating plan and strategic planning processes. The discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weighted average cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk and the rate of return a market participant would expect to achieve. The royalty rate assumption represents the estimated contribution of the intangible assets to the overall profits of the related businesses. Methodologies used for valuing our intangible assets did not change from prior periods.\nIn 2020, indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill were tested for impairment based on the identified asset (for indefinite-lived intangibles) or on our identified reporting units (for goodwill). There were no impairment charges recorded in 2020, 2019 or 2018 related to intangible assets. We did not test tangible assets within our continuing operations for impairment in 2020, 2019 or 2018 as no indicators of impairment existed.\nThe revenue and cash flow estimates used in applying our impairment tests are based on management\u2019s analysis of information available at the time of the impairment test and represent a market participant view. Actual cash flows lower than the estimate could lead to significant future impairments. If subsequent testing indicates that fair values have declined, the carrying values would be reduced and our future statements of operations would be affected.\nWe cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might lead to material impairment charges in the future. Such events may include, but are not limited to, the impact of economic environments, particularly related to the commercial and residential\nconstruction industries, material adverse changes in relationships with significant customers, or strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions. See Notes 3 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nEnvironmental Liabilities - We are actively involved in the investigation, closure and/or remediation of existing or potential environmental contamination under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), and state Superfund and similar environmental laws at two domestically owned locations allegedly resulting from past industrial activity. In a few cases, we are one of several potentially responsible parties and have agreed to jointly fund the required investigation, while preserving our defenses to the liability. We may also have rights of contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under applicable insurance policies.\nWe provide for environmental remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable. Accruals are estimates based on the judgment of management related to ongoing proceedings. Estimates of our future liability at the environmental sites are based on evaluations of currently available facts regarding each individual site. In determining the probability of contribution, we consider the solvency of other parties, the site activities of other parties, whether liability is being disputed, the terms of any existing agreements and experience with similar matters, and the effect of our October 2006 Chapter 11 reorganization upon the validity of the claim.\nWe evaluate the measurement of recorded liabilities each reporting period based on current facts and circumstances specific to each matter. The ultimate losses incurred upon final resolution may materially differ from the estimated liability recorded. Changes in estimates are recorded in earnings in the period in which such changes occur.\nWe are unable to predict the extent to which any recoveries from other parties or coverage under insurance policies might cover our final share of costs for these sites. Our final share of investigation and remediation costs may exceed any such recoveries, and such amounts net of insurance recoveries may be material. However, we do not expect the total future costs to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or financial condition as the cash payments may be made over many years.\nBusiness Combinations and Contingent Consideration - Acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the purchase price be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. Adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and/or liabilities assumed are amortized over the estimated useful life on a straight-line basis and recorded as a component of operating income (expense). Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The estimated fair value of contingent consideration is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet at the date of acquisition. The purchase price allocation requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, with respect to intangible assets and contingent consideration. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies. We engage independent, third-party valuation specialists to assist in determining the fair values of acquired intangible assets and contingent consideration.\nBoth the Moz and Turf acquisitions in 2020 include the potential for contingent earn out payments based on the financial performance of the acquired companies. We estimated the fair value of these contingent consideration liabilities upon acquisition and are required to measure the liability at fair value each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings in the period of the estimated fair value change. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nThe principal assumptions used in valuing certain intangible assets and contingent consideration include future expected cash flows from sales and acquired developed technologies, the acquired company's trade names and customer relationships as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade names and customer relationships will continue to be used in the combined company's portfolio, the probability of meeting the future revenue and EBITDA growth targets and discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows.\nThese estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used the total consideration, including the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration, could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value assigned to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities.\nACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS EFFECTIVE IN FUTURE PERIODS\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risk\nOur primary exposure to market risk is from changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We use forward swap contracts to hedge these exposures. The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative trading purposes. In addition, derivative financial instruments are entered into with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to manage our exposure to potential nonperformance on such instruments. We regularly monitor developments in the capital markets.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to replace LIBOR rates with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") effective in late 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") has proposed that the SOFR rate that represents best practice as the alternative to USD-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD-LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to USD-LIBOR. We continue to monitor the new SOFR rates and regulation related to our debt, interest rate hedging instruments and other contracts that are indexed to USD-LIBOR. We have adopted the optional expedients and exceptions issued in March 2020 under ASU 2020-04. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nCounterparty Risk\nWe only enter into derivative transactions with established financial institution counterparties having an investment-grade credit rating. We monitor counterparty credit default swap levels and credit ratings on a regular basis. All of our derivative transactions with counterparties are governed by master International Swap and Derivatives Association agreements (\u201cISDAs\u201d) with netting arrangements. These agreements can limit our exposure in situations where we have gain and loss positions outstanding with a single counterparty. We do not post nor do we receive cash collateral with any counterparty for our derivative transactions. These ISDAs do not have any credit contingent features; however, a default under our bank credit facility would trigger a default under these agreements. Exposure to individual counterparties is controlled and we consider the risk of counterparty default to be negligible.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nWe are subject to interest rate variability on our Term Loan A and revolving credit facility. A hypothetical increase of one-quarter percentage point in LIBOR interest rates from December 31, 2020 levels would increase 2021 interest expense by approximately $0.7 million. We have active interest rate swaps outstanding, which fix the interest rates for a portion of our debt. These active interest rate swaps are included in this calculation.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had interest rate swaps outstanding with notional amounts of $650.0 million, of which $450.0 million were active and $200.0 million were forward starting. We utilize interest rate swaps to minimize the fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. Under the terms of these swaps, we receive 1-month LIBOR and pay a fixed rate over the hedged period. The following table summarizes our interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2020 (dollar amounts in millions):\nThese swaps are designated as cash flow hedges against changes in LIBOR for a portion of our variable rate debt. The net liability measured at fair value was $28.9 million as of December 31, 2020.\nThe table below provides information about our long-term debt obligations as of December 31, 2020, including payment requirements and related weighted-average interest rates by scheduled maturity dates. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve and are exclusive of our interest rate swaps.\nVariable rate principal payments reflected in the preceding table exclude $3.2 million of unamortized debt financing costs as of December 31, 2020.",

We experienced less of a comparative decline in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2020.\nMineral Fiber net sales decreased 7.2% due to lower volumes of $8 million and unfavorable AUV of $6 million. Architectural Specialties net sales increased 5.9% due to the impact of the 2020 Acquisitions, partially offset by lower volumes. Net sales in both segments were negatively impacted by a reduction in demand as a result of COVID-19.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, cost of goods sold was 65.3% of net sales, compared to 64.1% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales in comparison to 2019 was primarily due to unfavorable AUV and the impact of the 2020 Acquisitions, partially offset by improved manufacturing productivity and cost reduction actions. The unfavorable AUV was primarily driven by lower mix due to changes in sales by customer group, and to a lesser extent, due to regional weakness in major metropolitan areas.\nSG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $54.5 million, or 22.8% of net sales compared to $40.0 million, or 16.2% of net sales, for the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in SG&A expenses was driven primarily by a $10 million charitable endowment level funding to the Armstrong Foundation, a $5 million increase in SG&A expenses, including intangible asset amortization, due to the impact of the 2020 Acquisitions, a $4 million increase in business development costs and investments in digitally enabled systems and tools, and a $3 million decrease in cost reimbursements, net of related expenses, earned under our Transaction Services Agreement with Knauf. These increases in SG&A expenses were partially offset by an $8 million reduction in expenses related to higher environmental insurance settlements, net of charges and a $2 million reduction in travel expense.\nEquity earnings in the fourth quarter of 2020 were $15.8 million compared to $13.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2019 and as a result of the Sale, we recorded a $5 million decrease in WAVE equity earnings, representing our share of WAVE\u2019s fourth quarter of 2019 loss on sale of its discontinued European and Pacific Rim businesses. Excluding the impact of our portion of WAVE\u2019s fourth quarter loss on the Sale, WAVE equity earnings decreased due to unfavorable AUV and lower sales volumes and an increase in selling and administrative charges from AWI and Worthington Industries, Inc. These decreases in WAVE equity earnings were partially offset by lower input costs, particularly steel. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nOperating income was $44.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $62.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nInterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased to $5.4 million compared to $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 due primarily to a decrease in LIBOR.\nFourth quarter income tax expense was $8.3 million on pre-tax earnings of $43.1 million in 2020 compared to $8.3 million on pre-tax earnings of $59.8 million in 2019. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was higher than the same period in 2019 primarily due to the absence of discrete tax benefits related to stock compensation deductions and deferred tax benefits that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share were both $0.72 in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to basic earnings per share of $0.74 and diluted earnings per share of $0.73 in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation and the criteria in the COSO framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\nKPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, as stated in their report included herein.\n/s/ Victor D.

McNamara\nStephen F. McNamara\nVice President and Corporate Controller\nFebruary 23, 2021\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Armstrong World Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries\u2019 (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, shareholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 23, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 23, 2021\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Armstrong World Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, shareholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 23, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases, and related amendments.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nPension and post retirement benefit obligations\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s pension projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the U.S. plans were $441.7 million and $520.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020, resulting in a funded status of $79.0 million. Additionally, the Company\u2019s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was $80.6 million, which is an unfunded liability.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company\u2019s measurement of the benefit obligations to be a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the discount rates, as minor changes in the rates could have a significant impact on the benefit obligations. Additionally, the assessment of the discount rates required specialized actuarial skills and knowledge.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s benefit obligations process, including controls related to the actuarial determination of the discount rates used in the valuation of the benefit obligations. Additionally, we involved an actuarial professional with specialized skill and knowledge, who assisted in the evaluation of the Company\u2019s discount rates by:\n\u2022\nassessing changes in the discount rates from the prior year against changes in published indices;\n\u2022\nassessing the discount rates based on the plan type, plan provisions and pattern of cash flows; and\n\u2022\nevaluating the selected yield curve, the consistency of the yield curve with the prior year, and the spot rates.\nFair value of contingent consideration\nAs discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, in July 2020, the Company acquired TURF Design Inc. (TURF) for $70.0 million of cash and potential for a contingent consideration payable in 2022 and 2023. The contingent consideration liability is recorded at fair value and re-measured each reporting period, with a maximum payout of $48.0 million upon achievement of certain revenue and earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) growth targets through 2022. A Monte Carlo model was used in the determination of the fair value of the contingent consideration and required the Company to derive assumptions such as forecasts of revenue, forecasts of EBITDA, volatility and discount rate. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the contingent consideration was $14.2 million.\nWe identified the evaluation of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability for the acquisition of TURF to be a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate key assumptions in the Monte Carlo model used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration. Key assumptions included forecasts of revenue, forecasts of EBITDA, volatility and discount rates. Auditing the Company\u2019s model involved complex and challenging auditor judgment as the assumptions used in the model did not have observable market inputs.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We performed sensitivity analyses over the forecasted revenue and EBITDA used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration to assess the impact of changes in those assumptions on the Company\u2019s determination of fair value. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s contingent consideration valuation process, including controls over the key assumptions listed above. In connection with our assessment of the revenue and EBITDA forecasts used in the valuation, we compared forecasted revenue and EBITDA as a percentage of revenue to historical actual results of the acquired company. We evaluated the forecasted revenue and EBITDA assumptions used in the Company\u2019s model by comparing them to publicly available market data. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n\u2022\nevaluating the Company\u2019s selection of an appropriate valuation model for the contingent consideration;\n\u2022\nassessing the selected volatility rates by comparing them against publicly available market data of comparable companies\n\u2022\nevaluating the discount rates by comparing them against ranges that were developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities and entity-specific data.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1929.\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 23, 2021\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income\n(amounts in millions, except per share data)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 46.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(amounts in millions, except share data)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 46.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders\u2019 Equity\n(amounts in millions, except share data)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 46.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(amounts in millions)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page 46.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nNOTE 1.

Moz is a designer and fabricator of custom architectural metal ceilings, walls, dividers and column covers for interior and exterior applications with one manufacturing facility.\nIn July 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of TURF Design, Inc. (\u201cTurf\u201d), with one manufacturing facility in Elgin, Illinois and a design center in Chicago, Illinois. Turf is a designer and manufacturer of acoustic felt ceilings and wall products.\nIn November 2019, we acquired the business and assets of MRK Industries, Inc. (\u201cMRK\u201d), based in Libertyville, Illinois. MRK is a manufacturer of specialty metal ceiling, wall and exterior solutions with one manufacturing facility.\nIn March 2019, we acquired the business and assets of Architectural Components Group, Inc. (\u201cACGI\u201d), based in Marshfield, Missouri. ACGI is a manufacturer of custom wood ceilings and walls with one manufacturing facility.\nIn August 2018, we acquired the business and assets of Steel Ceilings, Inc. (\u201cSteel Ceilings\u201d), based in Johnstown, Ohio. Steel Ceilings is a manufacturer of aluminum and stainless metal ceilings that include architectural, radiant and security solutions with one manufacturing facility.\nIn May 2018, we acquired the business and assets of Plasterform, Inc. (\u201cPlasterform\u201d), based in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Plasterform is a manufacturer of architectural cast ceilings, walls, facades, columns and moldings with one manufacturing facility.\nThe operations, assets and liabilities of these acquisitions are included in our Architectural Specialties segment. See Note 5 for further information on our recent acquisitions.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn September 30, 2019, we completed the sale of certain subsidiaries comprising our businesses and operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (including Russia) (\u201cEMEA\u201d) and the Pacific Rim, including the corresponding businesses and operations conducted by Worthington Armstrong Venture (\u201cWAVE\u201d), our joint venture with Worthington Industries, Inc. (\u201cWorthington\u201d) in which AWI holds a 50% interest (collectively, the \u201cSale\u201d), to Knauf International GmbH (\u201cKnauf\u201d). The purchase price of $330.0 million was previously paid by Knauf to us during 2018 and was subject to certain post-closing adjustments for cash and debt as provided in the Purchase Agreement dated as of November 17, 2017, by and between us and Knauf (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d), including adjustments based on the economic impact of any required regulatory remedies and a working capital adjustment. During 2020, we remitted $25.9 million, respectively, to WAVE for their remaining portion of the proceeds from Knauf. Also during 2020, WAVE paid each of AWI and Worthington dividends of $13.0 million relating to these payments. During the third quarter of 2020, we remitted $6.4 million to Knauf for working capital and other adjustments. In January 2021, we finalized the post-closing adjustments to purchase price related to certain pension liabilities assumed by Knauf in the Sale. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a $12.0 million loss primarily related to this purchase price adjustment, which is reflected within accounts payable and accrued expenses as of December 31, 2020.\nIn 2019, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement with Knauf for its benefit and the benefit of a buyer of certain businesses divested by Knauf, pursuant to which we provided certain transition technology, finance and information technology support services. The Transition Services Agreement expired in 2020. In connection with the closing of the Sale, we also entered into (i) a royalty-free intellectual property License Agreement with Knauf under which they, and the buyers of certain businesses divested by Knauf, license patents, trademarks and know-how from us for use in licensed territories in which the business was conducted prior to the Sale, and (ii) a Supply Agreement with Knauf under which the parties may continue to purchase certain products from each other following the\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nclosing of the Sale. WAVE also entered into similar agreements with Knauf for such purposes. The term of the granted licenses, with respect to each intellectual property right, extend until the expiration or abandonment of each such intellectual property right.\nThe EMEA and Pacific Rim segment historical financial results through September 30, 2019 have been reflected in AWI\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as discontinued operations for all periods presented, while the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations have been removed from AWI\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019.\nCOVID-19 Considerations\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has created significant volatility and economic disruption and the impact on our future consolidated results of operations is uncertain. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our employees, operations, customers, suppliers and financial results depends on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; government actions taken in response to the pandemic; the availability and distribution of vaccinations; the impact on construction activity; the effect on our customers demand for our ceiling and wall systems; our ability to manufacture and sell our products; and the ability of our customers to pay for our products. While many of our products support life sustaining activities and essential construction, we, and certain of our customers or suppliers, may be impacted by state actions, orders and policies regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary closures of non-life sustaining businesses, shelter-in-place orders, and travel, social distancing and quarantine policies, the implementation and enforcement of which vary by individual U.S. states and by individual countries in the Americas. We did not record any asset impairments, inventory charges or material bad debt reserves related to COVID-19 during 2020 but future events may require such charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nConsolidation Policy. The consolidated financial statements and accompanying data in this report include the accounts of AWI and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements.\nUse of Estimates. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. When preparing an estimate, management determines the amount based upon the consideration of relevant internal and external information. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nReclassifications. Certain amounts in the prior year\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes have been recast to conform to the 2020 presentation.\nRevenue Recognition. On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments using the modified retrospective transition method. This adoption did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows as the amount and timing of substantially all of our revenues are recognized at a point in time.\nWe recognize revenue upon transfer of control of our products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment. Our main performance obligation to our customers is the delivery of products in accordance with purchase orders. Each purchase order confirms the transaction price for the products purchased under the arrangement. Direct sales to building materials distributors, home centers, direct customers and retailers represent the majority of our sales. Our standard sales terms are Free On Board (\u201cFOB\u201d) shipping point. We have some sales terms that are FOB destination. At the point of shipment, the customer is required to pay under normal sales terms. Our normal payment terms in most cases are 45 days or less and our sales arrangements do not have any material financing components. In addition, our customer arrangements do not produce contract assets or liabilities that are material to our consolidated financial statements. Within our Architectural Specialties segment, the majority of revenues are customer project driven, which includes a minority of revenues derived from the sale of customer specified customized products that have no alternative use to us. The manufacturing cycle for these custom products is typically short.\nIncremental costs to fulfill our customer arrangements are expensed as incurred, as the amortization period is less than one year.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nOur products are sold with normal and customary return provisions. We provide limited warranties for defects in materials or factory workmanship, sagging and warping, and certain other manufacturing defects. Warranties are not sold separately to customers. Our product warranties place certain requirements on the purchaser, including installation and maintenance in accordance with our written instructions. In addition to our warranty program, under certain limited circumstances, we will occasionally at our sole discretion provide a customer accommodation repair or replacement. Warranty repairs and replacements are most commonly made by professional installers employed by or affiliated with our independent distributors. Reimbursement for costs associated with warranty repairs are provided to our independent distributors through a credit against accounts receivable from the distributor to us. Sales returns and warranty claims have historically not been material and do not constitute separate performance obligations.\nWe often offer incentive programs to our customers, primarily volume rebates and promotions. The majority of our rebates are designated as a percentage of annual customer purchases. We estimate the amount of rebates based on actual sales for the period and accrue for the projected incentive programs costs. We record the costs of rebate accruals as a reduction to the transaction price. Other sales discounts, including early pay promotions, are deducted immediately from the sales invoice.\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our revenues.\nShipping and Handling Costs. We account for product shipping and handling costs as fulfillment activities and present the associated costs in costs of goods sold in the period in which we sell our product.\nAdvertising Costs. We recognize advertising expenses as they are incurred.\nResearch and Development Costs. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.\nBusiness Combinations. We account for acquisitions under the acquisition method and the results of acquired operations are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. We allocate total consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, with the remaining unallocated amount recorded as goodwill. Our definite-lived intangible assets, and adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and/or liabilities assumed, are amortized over the estimated useful life on a straight-line basis and recorded as a component of operating income (expense). The fair value of acquired intangible assets is estimated by applying discounted cash flow models based on significant level 3 inputs not observable in the market. Key assumptions are developed based on each acquirees\u2019 historical experience, future projections and comparable market data including future cash flows, long-term growth rates, implied royalty rates, attrition rates and discount rates. Acquisition-related contingent consideration that is classified as a liability is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities recorded in reporting periods after the acquisition date are recorded within selling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits. We have benefit plans that provide for pension, medical and life insurance benefits to certain eligible employees when they retire from active service. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures on pension and postretirement benefits.\nTaxes. The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes to reflect the expected future tax consequences of events recognized in the financial statements. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying enacted tax rates to temporary differences that exist as of the balance sheet date, which result from differences in the timing of reported taxable income between tax and financial reporting.\nWe reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. The need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed quarterly. In assessing the requirement for, and amount of, a valuation allowance in accordance with the more likely than not standard, we give appropriate consideration to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability and foreign source income, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforward expirations. A history of cumulative losses is a significant piece of negative evidence used in our assessment. If a history of cumulative losses is incurred for a tax jurisdiction, forecasts of future profitability are generally not used as positive evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets in the assessment.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nWe recognize the tax benefits of an uncertain tax position if those benefits are more likely than not to be sustained based on existing tax law. Additionally, we establish a reserve for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained based on existing tax law, but uncertain in the ultimate benefit to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Unrecognized tax benefits are subsequently recognized at the time the more likely than not recognition threshold is met, the tax matter is effectively settled or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the tax position has expired, whichever is earliest.\nTaxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are reported on a net basis.\nEarnings per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the earnings attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings and is calculated using the treasury stock method.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and short-term investments that have maturities of three months or less when purchased.\nConcentration of Credit. We principally sell products to customers in building products industries. Revenues from two commercial distributors, included within our Mineral Fiber and Architectural Specialties segments, individually exceeded 10% of our revenues in 2020. Gross sales to these two customers totaled $370.3 million and $428.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenues from three commercial distributors individually exceeded 10% of our revenues in 2018. Gross sales to these three customers totaled $459.3 million in 2018. We monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and generally do not require collateral.\nReceivables. On January 1, 2020, we adopted ASC 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. This adoption did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe sell our products to select, pre-approved customers using customary trade terms that allow for payment in the future. Customer trade receivables, customer notes receivable and miscellaneous receivables (which include supply related rebates and other), net of allowances for doubtful accounts, customer credits and warranties are reported in accounts and notes receivable, net. Cash flows from the collection of receivables are classified as operating cash flows on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nWe establish creditworthiness prior to extending credit. We estimate the recoverability of receivables each period. This estimate is based upon new information in the period, which can include the review of any available financial statements and forecasts, as well as discussions with legal counsel and the management of the debtor company. As events occur, which impact the collectability of the receivable, all or a portion of the receivable is reserved. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the potential for recovery is considered remote. We do not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers.\nInventories. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our accounting for inventories.\nProperty Plant and Equipment. Property plant and equipment is recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the assets\u2019 estimated useful lives. Machinery and equipment includes manufacturing equipment (depreciated over 2 to 15 years), computer equipment (depreciated over 3 to 5 years) and office furniture and equipment (depreciated over 5 to 7 years). Within manufacturing equipment, assets that are subject to accelerated obsolescence or wear out quickly, such as dryer components, are generally depreciated over shorter periods while heavy production equipment, such as conveyors and production presses, are generally depreciated over longer periods. Buildings are depreciated over 15 to 30 years, depending on factors such as type of construction and use. Computer software is amortized over 3 to 7 years.\nProperty, plant and equipment is tested for impairment by asset group when indicators of impairment are present, such as operating losses and/or negative cash flows for each identified asset group. If an indication of impairment exists, we compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, we determine the fair value of the asset group based on discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group, or based on management\u2019s estimated exit price assuming the assets could be sold in an orderly transaction between market participants, or estimated salvage value if no sale is assumed. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the asset group, we record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset group. Impairments of assets related to our manufacturing operations are recorded in cost of goods sold. We did not test tangible assets within our continuing operations for impairment in 2020, 2019 or 2018 as no indicators of impairment existed.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nWhen assets are disposed of or retired, their costs and related depreciation or amortization are removed from the financial statements, and any resulting gains or losses are normally reflected in cost of goods sold or SG&A expenses depending on the nature of the asset.\nLeases. On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASC 842 - Leases and all the related amendments using the modified retrospective transition method. Upon adoption of this standard, we recognized right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and lease liabilities of $29.2 million based on the present value of the future minimum rental payments for our existing leases.\nWe enter into operating and finance leases for certain manufacturing plants, warehouses, equipment and automobiles. Our leases have remaining lease terms of up to 17 years. Several leases include options for us to purchase leased items at fair value or renew for up to 5 years, or multiple 5-year renewal periods. Some of our leases include early termination options. We consider all of these options in determining the lease term used to establish our ROU assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Our lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and nonlease components, which we have elected to combine to determine the ROU assets and lease liabilities. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. We recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate (\u201cIBR\u201d) based on information that is available at the lease commencement date to compute the present value of lease payments. Relevant information used in determining the IBR includes the transactional currency of the lease and the lease term.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. We recognize the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which they are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the discounted cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding asset\u2019s useful life. Over time, accretion of the liability is recognized as an operating expense to reflect the change in the liability\u2019s present value.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. Our definite-lived intangible assets are primarily customer relationships (amortized over 1 to 20 years), developed technology (amortized over 13 to 19 years) and acquired internally-developed software (amortized over 7 years). We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment by asset group when indicators of impairment are present, such as operating losses and/or negative cash flows for the respective asset group. If an indication of impairment exists, we compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, we determine the fair value of the asset group based on discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group or based on management\u2019s estimated exit price assuming the assets could be sold in an orderly transaction between market participants. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the asset group, we record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset group. We did not test definite-lived intangible assets within our continuing operations for impairment in 2020, 2019 or 2018 as no indicators of impairment existed.\nOur indefinite-lived assets include goodwill and other intangibles, primarily trademarks and brand names, with Armstrong representing our primary trademark. Trademarks and brand names are integral to our corporate identity and are expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows. Accordingly, they have been assigned an indefinite life. We conduct our annual impairment tests on these indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill during the fourth quarter. These assets undergo more frequent tests if an indication of possible impairment exists. When performing an impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, we compare the carrying amount of the asset (when testing indefinite-lived intangible assets) and reporting unit (when testing goodwill) to the estimated fair value. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, the estimated fair value is based on discounted future cash flows using the relief from royalty method. For goodwill, the estimated fair value is based on discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the asset/reporting unit, we record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset/reporting unit. We did not test indefinite-lived intangible assets within our continuing operations for impairment during any interim periods during 2020, as no indicators of impairment existed. We completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2020 and no impairment charges were recorded.\nSee Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure on intangible assets.\nForeign Currency Transactions. Assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries operating outside the United States which are accounted in a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated using the period end exchange rate. Revenues and expenses are translated at exchange rates effective during each month. Foreign currency translation gains or losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) within shareholders' equity. Gains or losses on foreign currency transactions are recognized through earnings.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nFinancial Instruments and Derivatives. From time to time, we use derivatives and other financial instruments to offset the effect of interest rate variability. Derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. For derivatives that meet the criteria as designated cash flow hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in operations. See Notes 19 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nShare-based Employee Compensation. We generally recognize share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire award. Compensation expense for performance-based awards with non-market-based conditions are also recognized over the vesting period for the entire award, however, compensation expense may vary based on the expectations for actual performance relative to defined performance measures. We estimate forfeitures based on actual historical forfeitures. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on share-based employee compensation.\nTreasury Stock. Common shares repurchased by AWI are recorded on the settlement date at cost as treasury shares and result in a reduction of equity. We may reissue these treasury shares. When treasury shares are reissued, we determine the cost using the First-in, first-out cost method (\u201cFIFO\u201d). The difference between the cost of the treasury shares and reissuance price is included in additional paid-in capital or retained earnings.\nSubsequent Events. On February 17, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.21 per common share outstanding. The dividend will be paid on March 18, 2021, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 4, 2021.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, \"Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\" which requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses that are expected to occur over the remaining life of many financial assets. This standard applies to all financial assets, including trade receivables. Our current accounts receivable policy uses historical and current information to estimate the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable balances. Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted this standard, which had no material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step from the current goodwill impairment test. Under this standard, an entity recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the fair value. Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted this standard prospectively. Our adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, \u201cChanges to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.\u201d This standard eliminates the requirement to disclose the amount or reason for transfers between level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the requirement to disclose the valuation methodology for level 3 fair value measurements. The standard includes additional disclosure requirements for level 3 fair value measurements, including the requirement to disclose the changes in unrealized gains and losses in other comprehensive income during the period and permits the disclosure of other relevant quantitative information for certain unobservable inputs. Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted this standard, which resulted in additional disclosures for level 3 fair value measurements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, \u201cDisclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans,\u201d which amends ASC 715-20, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans. The ASU modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The disclosure requirements to be removed include the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit costs over the next fiscal year, the amount and timing of plan assets expected to be returned to the employer and the effect of a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates on the aggregate service cost and benefit obligation for postretirement health care benefits. The new disclosure requirements include the interest crediting rates for cash balance plans, and an explanation of significant gains and losses related to changes in benefit obligations. Effective the fourth quarter of 2020, we adopted this standard which resulted in changes to our disclosures.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, \u201cCustomer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract,\u201d which amends ASC 350-40 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software. The\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nASU requires implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements to be deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement, if these costs were capitalized by the customer in a software licensing arrangement. Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted this standard prospectively. Our adoption of this standard had no material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, \u201cFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,\u201d which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and other interbank offered rates. This guidance is effective through December 31, 2022. Effective the second quarter of 2020 we adopted this standard, which had no impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, \u201cSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,\u201d which removes exceptions to the general principles in ASC Topic 740 - Income Taxes for allocating tax expense between financial statement components, accounting basis differences resulting from an ownership change in foreign investments and interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed projected losses. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. We are evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNOTE 3. NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nOur operating segments are as follows: Mineral Fiber, Architectural Specialties and Unallocated Corporate.\nMineral Fiber - produces suspended mineral fiber and soft fiber ceiling systems for use in commercial and residential settings. Products offer various performance attributes such as acoustical control, rated fire protection, aesthetic appeal and health attributes. Commercial ceiling products are sold to resale distributors and to ceiling systems contractors. Residential ceiling products are sold primarily to wholesalers and retailers (including large home centers). The Mineral Fiber segment also includes the results of WAVE, which manufactures and sells suspension system (grid) products and ceiling component products that are invoiced by both AWI and WAVE. Segment results relating to WAVE consist primarily of equity earnings and reflect our 50% equity interest in the joint venture. Ceiling component products consist of ceiling perimeters and trim, in addition to grid products that support drywall ceiling systems. To a lesser extent, however, in some geographies and for some customers, WAVE sells its suspension systems products to AWI for resale to customers. Mineral Fiber segment results reflect those sales transactions. The Mineral Fiber segment also includes all assets and liabilities not specifically allocated to our Architectural Specialties or Unallocated Corporate segment, including all property and related depreciation associated with our Lancaster, PA headquarters. Operating results for the Mineral Fiber segment include a significant majority of allocated Corporate administrative expenses that represent a reasonable allocation of general services to support its operations.\nArchitectural Specialties - produces and sources ceilings and walls for use in commercial settings. Products are available in numerous materials, such as metal and wood, in addition to various colors, shapes and designs. Products offer various performance attributes such as acoustical control, rated fire protection and aesthetic appeal. We sell standard and customized products, and a portion of our Architectural Specialties revenues are derived from sourced products. Architectural Specialties products are sold primarily to resale distributors and ceiling systems contractors. The majority of revenues are project driven, which can lead to more volatile sales patterns due to project scheduling uncertainty. Operating results for the Architectural Specialties segment include a portion of allocated Corporate administrative expenses that represent a reasonable allocation of general services to support its operations.\nUnallocated Corporate - includes assets, liabilities, income and expenses that have not been allocated to our other business segments and consists of cash and cash equivalents, the net funded status of our U.S. Retirement Income Plan (\u201cRIP\u201d), the estimated fair value of interest rate swap contracts, outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility and income tax balances. Our Unallocated Corporate segment also includes all assets, liabilities, income and expenses formerly reported in our EMEA and Pacific Rim segments that were not included in the Sale.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\n(1)\nTotal differs from our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows by the amount that was classified as discontinued operations. See Note 6 for additional details.\nSegment operating income (loss) is the measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. The sum of the segments\u2019 operating income (loss) equals the total consolidated operating income as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The following reconciles our total consolidated operating income to (loss) earnings from continuing operations before income taxes. These items are only measured and managed on a consolidated basis:\nAccounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nThe sales in the table below are allocated to geographic areas based on the location of our selling entities.\nDuring 2020, we recorded a $21.0 million gain related to the sale of our idled mineral fiber plant in China, inclusive of accumulated foreign currency translation gains.\nIn connection with the 2018 closing of our St. Helens, Oregon Mineral Fiber manufacturing facility we recorded $14.1 million in 2018 in cost of goods sold related to accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment.\nNOTE 4. REVENUE\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nOur Mineral Fiber and Architectural Specialties operating segments both manufacture and sell ceiling and wall systems (primarily mineral fiber, fiberglass wool, metal, wood, wood fiber, glass-reinforced-gypsum and felt) throughout the Americas. We disaggregate revenue based on our product-based segments and major customer channels, as they represent the most appropriate depiction of how the nature, amount and timing of revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Net sales by major customer channel are as follows:\nDistributors - represents net sales to building materials distributors who re-sell our products to contractors, subcontractors\u2019 alliances, large architect and design firms, and major facility owners. Geographically, this category includes sales throughout the U.S., Canada, and Latin America.\nHome centers - represents net sales to home centers, such as Lowe\u2019s Companies, Inc. and The Home Depot, Inc. This category includes sales primarily to U.S. customers.\nDirect customers - represents net sales to contractors, subcontractors, and large architect and design firms. This category includes sales primarily to U.S. customers.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nRetailers and other - represents net sales to independent retailers and certain national account customers, including wholesalers who re-sell our products to dealers who service builders, contractors and consumers, online customers, major facility owners, group purchasing organizations and maintenance, repair and operating (\u201cMRO\u201d) entities. Geographically, this category includes sales throughout the U.S. and Canada.\nThe following tables provide net sales by major customer group within the Mineral Fiber and Architectural Specialties segments for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nNOTE 5. ACQUISITIONS\nARKTURA\nOn December 16, 2020, we acquired all the issued and outstanding equity of Arktura LLC (\u201cArktura\u201d) and its subsidiaries with operations in the United States and Argentina for $90.6 million of cash paid at closing, net of $0.8 million of cash acquired, subject to customary post-closing adjustments for working capital. A portion of the cash consideration paid at closing is being held in escrow to secure potential claims for indemnification under the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, and contingent upon continued employment with AWI over the next five years, we are obligated to pay the sellers an additional $24.0 million in cash payments over a period of five years and issued an additional $6.0 million of restricted stock which will vest over a period of five years. Contingent upon employment with AWI over the next three years, we also issued an additional $1.4 million of restricted stock to key Arktura employees which will vest over a period of three years. Compensation expense associated with these cash payments and restricted stock awards will be recorded over the required service and vesting periods.\nThe total fair value of tangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, was $4.1 million. The total fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired was $36.2 million, resulting in $51.1 million of goodwill. We identified non-amortizable tradenames of $14.5 million. We also identified amortizable intangible assets comprised of software of $9.1 million, backlog of $5.9 million, customer relationships of $3.3 million, a non-compete agreement of $2.8 million and patents of $0.6 million that are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average life of 7, 1, 1, 5, and 17 years, respectively. The weighted average amortization period for acquired intangible assets as of the date of acquisition was 4.3 years. Goodwill from the Arktura acquisition relates to many factors, including the technical competencies and capabilities of the acquired workforce in the fields of architecture, design, materials science, technology and software, and our strategic intent to integrate and leverage those competencies and capabilities to advance and expand our portfolio of solutions and offerings. All of the acquired goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.\nValuations for assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on provisional estimates. We will continue to evaluate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the acquisition. Additional information, which existed as of the acquisition date, but was at that time unknown to us, may become known during the remainder of the measurement period. Changes to amounts recorded may result in a corresponding adjustment to these assets and liabilities, including goodwill. The determination of the estimated fair values of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed is expected to be completed within one year from the date of acquisition.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nIn connection with the Arktura acquisition, we formed Arktura Ventures LLC, an incubator entity for the development and commercialization of new products and solutions in the architecture, engineering and construction space. As of December 31, 2020, the venture entity had no funding or operations.\nMOZ\nOn August 24, 2020, we acquired the business and assets of Moz for $4.2 million of cash paid at closing and the potential for a contingent earn out payable in 2022 not to exceed $4.7 million. We, with the assistance of an independent, third-party valuation specialist, utilized a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of $2.7 million, resulting in total acquisition consideration of $6.9 million. The total fair value of liabilities assumed, less tangible assets acquired, was $0.4 million. The total fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired was $2.7 million, comprised of non-amortizable tradenames of $1.5 million, amortizable customer relationships of $0.6 million and backlog of $0.6 million, resulting in $4.6 million of goodwill. All of the acquired goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. The contingent consideration is payable upon achievement of certain future performance objectives through December 31, 2021. See Note 19 for changes in fair value of contingent consideration.\nTURF\nOn July 27, 2020, we acquired all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Turf for a purchase price of $70.0 million of cash paid at closing and the potential for a contingent earn out payable in 2022 and 2023 not to exceed $48.0 million. We, with the assistance of an independent, third-party valuation specialist, utilized a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of $14.1 million, resulting in total acquisition consideration of $84.1 million. The total fair value of tangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, was $4.8 million. The total fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired was $27.9 million, resulting in $51.4 million of goodwill. We identified non-amortizable tradenames of $9.6 million. We also identified amortizable intangible assets comprised of customer relationships of $7.7 million, patents of $5.8 million and a non-compete agreement of $3.3 million that are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average life of 2, 20, and 5 years, respectively. The weighted average amortization period for acquired intangible assets as of the date of acquisition was 8.3 years. Goodwill from the Turf acquisition relates to many factors, including the design talents of the acquired workforce, fabrication capabilities and capacity, broad-based go-to-market channels and relationships, established leadership in a growing product category, and our strategic intent to leverage its position and attributes to grow and expand our portfolio of solutions. All of the acquired goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.\nThe contingent consideration is payable upon achievement of certain future performance objectives through 2022. The contingent consideration includes up to $24.0 million in additional cash consideration for performance at certain revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) growth targets. Full payout for target performance requires compounded annual growth rates in excess of 23% through December 31, 2022. The contingent consideration also includes up to $24.0 million in additional cash consideration for performance over revenue and EBITDA growth targets. Full payout for achievement over target performance requires compounded annual growth rates in excess of 38% through December 31, 2022. See Note 19 for changes in fair value of contingent consideration.\nMRK\nOn November 25, 2019, we acquired the business and assets of MRK. The $13.3 million purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, with the remaining unallocated amount recorded as goodwill. The total fair value of tangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, was $2.9 million, resulting in $10.4 million of goodwill. All of the acquired goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.\nACGI\nOn March 4, 2019, we acquired the business and assets of ACGI. The $42.9 million purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, with the remaining unallocated amount recorded as goodwill. The total fair value of tangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, was $7.3 million. The total fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired was $12.0 million, mostly comprised of amortizable customer relationships of $7.4 million and amortizable tradenames of $2.8 million, resulting in $23.6 million of goodwill. All of the acquired goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nSTEEL CEILINGS\nOn August 16, 2018, we acquired the business and assets of Steel Ceilings. The $12.3 million purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, with the remaining amount recorded as goodwill. In October 2018, we sold certain assets related to an acquired product line to WAVE for $2.0 million. The total fair value of tangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, was $4.4 million. The total fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired was mostly comprised of amortizable customer relationships of $1.4 million and tradenames of $1.3 million, resulting in $3.2 million of goodwill. All of the acquired goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.\nPLASTERFORM\nOn May 31, 2018, we acquired the business and assets of Plasterform. The $11.9 million purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, with the remaining amount recorded as goodwill. The total fair value of tangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, was $2.2 million. The total fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired, comprised of amortizable customer relationships, was $4.8 million, resulting in $4.9 million of goodwill. All of the acquired goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.\nPRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe following table summarizes aggregate audited as reported information and aggregate unaudited pro forma information assuming the acquisitions of Arktura, Moz and Turf had occurred on January 1, 2018. The unaudited pro forma results include the depreciation and amortization associated with the acquired assets, compensation expense related to cash payments and equity awards granted to employees of the acquired companies and adjustments to revenue for the purchase accounting effects of recording deferred revenue at fair value. In addition, the unaudited pro forma results do not include any expected benefits of the acquisitions. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or results that might have been achieved had the acquisitions been consummated as of January 1, 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net sales of $18.2 million and net earnings of $0.4 million from Arktura, Moz and Turf were included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income since the acquisition dates.\nThe 2019 and 2018 acquisitions, both individually and in the aggregate, did not have a material impact on reported net sales or net earnings for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nNOTE 6. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nEMEA AND PACIFIC RIM BUSINESSES\nOn November 17, 2017, we agreed to sell certain subsidiaries comprising our businesses in EMEA and the Pacific Rim to Knauf. The Sale was completed on September 30, 2019. Prior to completion of the Sale, each quarter, we compared the anticipated sales proceeds from Knauf to the carrying value of EMEA and Pacific Rim net assets. We recorded an estimated loss when the carrying value exceeded the anticipated sales proceeds. Net gains were only recorded to the extent of previous estimated losses.\nWe recorded an estimated loss on sale of $31.2 million and $19.3 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, we recorded a loss of $17.2 million, primarily related to an $11.4 million purchase price adjustment related to certain pension liabilities included in the Sale in addition to working capital and other adjustments.\nSee Note 1 for further discussion of the Sale.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nFLOORING BUSINESSES\nSeparation and Distribution of AFI\nOn April 1, 2016, we completed our separation of Armstrong Flooring, Inc. (\u201cAFI\u201d) by allocating the assets and liabilities related primarily to our Resilient and Wood Flooring segments to AFI and then distributing the common stock of AFI to our shareholders at a ratio of one share of AFI common stock for every two shares of AWI common stock.\nEuropean Resilient Flooring\nDuring 2020, we recorded a gain of $0.8 million related to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) adjustments from a previously discontinued foreign flooring entity, which was dissolved in the second quarter of 2020. The AOCI adjustments related to accumulated foreign currency translation amounts.\nSummarized Financial Information of Discontinued Operations\nThe following tables detail the businesses and line items that comprise discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nThe following is a summary of total gains and losses, capital expenditures and operating lease information related to our former EMEA and Pacific Rim businesses through the date of disposal, and gains on the dissolution of our previously discontinued flooring entity, which are presented as discontinued operations and included as components of operating and investing cash flows on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\n(1)\nRepresents certain pension liabilities, working capital and other adjustments.\n(2)\nRepresents comparison of the EMEA and Pacific Rim net assets to the expected final sales proceeds.\n(3)\nRepresents AOCI adjustments related to accumulated foreign currency translation amounts.\n(4)\nThe amount of cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities was not materially different from the operating lease cost for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.\n(5)\nRepresents initial ROU assets recognized upon adoption on January 1, 2019. We did not obtain any new ROU assets in exchange for lease obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2019.\nNOTE 7. ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE\nWe sell our products to select, pre-approved customers whose businesses are affected by changes in economic and market conditions. We consider these factors and the financial condition of each customer when establishing our allowance for losses from doubtful accounts.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nMiscellaneous receivables included proceeds from company-owned life insurance policies of $3.2 million and $0.8 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Miscellaneous receivables as of December 31, 2019 also included $2.5 million of amounts due from Knauf related to our Transaction Services Agreement that were collected during 2020.\nNOTE 8. INVENTORIES\nApproximately 69% and 73% of our total inventory in 2020 and 2019, respectively, were valued on a Last-in, first-out (\u201cLIFO\u201d) basis.\nThe distinction between the use of different methods of inventory valuation is primarily based on type of inventory, legal entities and/or geographical locations. The following table summarizes the amount of inventory that is not accounted for under the LIFO method.\nU.S. locations above generally use the weighted average cost method of inventory valuation and primarily represent certain finished goods sourced from third party suppliers and certain entities within our Architectural Specialties segment, most notably recent acquisitions, that also use the weighted average cost method given the nature of the inventory.\nOur Canadian locations use the FIFO method of inventory valuation (or other methods which closely approximate the FIFO method) primarily because the LIFO method is not permitted for local tax and/or statutory reporting purposes. In these situations, a conversion to LIFO would be highly complex and involve excessive cost and effort to achieve under local tax and/or statutory reporting requirements.\nNOTE 9. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\nAs of December 31, 2019, assets held for sale included the property, plant and equipment of our idle mineral fiber plant in China, which was sold in 2020.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nNOTE 10. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nNOTE 11. EQUITY INVESTMENTS\nInvestment in joint venture as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 reflected the equity interest in our 50% investment in our WAVE joint venture. The WAVE joint venture is reflected within the Mineral Fiber segment in our consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.\nWe use the cumulative earnings approach to determine the appropriate classification of distributions from WAVE within our cash flow statement. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, WAVE distributed amounts in excess of our capital contributions and proportionate share of retained earnings. Accordingly, the distributions in these years were reflected as a return of investment in cash flows from investing activity in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Distributions from WAVE in 2020, 2019 and 2018, were $81.5 million, $85.2 million, and $141.7 million, respectively.\nIn certain markets, we sell WAVE products directly to customers pursuant to specific terms of sale. In those circumstances, we record the sales and associated costs within our consolidated financial statements. The total sales associated with these transactions were $35.2 million, $33.5 million and $32.8 million for the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe European and Pacific Rim businesses of WAVE were included in the Sale to Knauf on September 30, 2019. Accordingly, WAVE\u2019s European and Pacific Rim historical financial statement results have been reflected in WAVE\u2019s consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. Our equity earnings in joint venture reflected as a component of earnings from continuing operations included $3.0 million and $1.5 million of equity earnings representing WAVE\u2019s net earnings from operations of its discontinued European and Pacific Rim businesses in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Condensed financial data for WAVE is summarized below on a continuing operations basis.\nIn connection with the sale of WAVE\u2019s European and Pacific Rim businesses and operations to Knauf on September 30, 2019, WAVE recorded a $46.2 million gain on sale during 2019, which included $10.2 million of unfavorable AOCI adjustments. As such, during 2019, we recorded our share of WAVE\u2019s gain on sale of discontinued operations of $20.6 million, which was included as a component of Equity earnings from joint venture in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nOur recorded investment in WAVE was higher than our 50% share of the carrying values reported in WAVE\u2019s consolidated financial statements by $141.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and $145.8 million as of December 31, 2019. These differences are due to our adoption of fresh-start reporting upon emergence from Chapter 11 in October 2006, while WAVE\u2019s consolidated financial statements do not reflect fresh-start reporting. The differences are composed of the following fair value adjustments to assets:\nOther intangibles include customer relationships, trademarks and developed technology. Customer relationships are amortized over 20 years and developed technology is amortized over 15 years. Trademarks have an indefinite life. During the third quarter of 2019, we wrote off $4.4 million of customer relationships and developed technology intangible assets attributed to WAVE\u2019s European and Pacific Rim businesses included in the Sale. This write-off was included as a reduction to Equity earnings from joint venture in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nManagement regularly evaluates its investment in WAVE for impairment, including performing an evaluation as a result of the sale of WAVE\u2019s European and Pacific Rim businesses to Knauf. Based on those evaluations, management concluded that its investment in WAVE was not impaired.\nSee discussion in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on this related party.\nNOTE 12. LEASES\nThe following table presents our lease costs:\nShort-term lease expense and variable lease cost were not material for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Rent expense was $6.1 million in 2018. As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any material leases that have not yet commenced.\nThe following table presents supplemental cash flow information related to our leases:\n(1)\nThe year ended December 31, 2019 includes initial ROU assets of $29.2 million recognized upon adoption on January 1, 2019.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nThe following table presents the weighted average assumptions used to compute our ROU assets and lease liabilities:\nUndiscounted future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2020, by year and in the aggregate, having non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows:\nNOTE 13. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nWe conduct our annual impairment testing of goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets during the fourth quarter. The 2020, 2019 and 2018 reviews concluded that no impairment charges were necessary. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policy for goodwill and intangible assets.\nThe following table details amounts related to our goodwill and intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nThe increase in goodwill as of December 31, 2020 resulted from the acquisitions of Arktura, Moz and Turf and foreign exchange movements. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nThe expected annual amortization expense for the years 2021 through 2025 are as follows:\nNOTE 14. OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS\nNOTE 15. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES\nNOTE 16. INCOME TAXES\nThe tax effects of principal temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis are summarized below. Management believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction to realize deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. In arriving at this conclusion, we considered the profit before tax, excluding the impact of the pension settlement, generated for the years 2018 through 2020, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and projections of future profit before tax.\nWe reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. The need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed quarterly. In assessing the requirement for, and amount of, a valuation allowance in accordance with the more likely than not standard for all periods, we consider all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforward expirations. A history of cumulative losses is a significant piece of negative evidence used in our assessment. If a history of cumulative losses is incurred for a tax jurisdiction, forecasts of future profitability are not used as positive evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets in the assessment.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $806.9 million and $897.3 million, respectively, of gross state net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards expiring between 2021 and 2040. As of December 31, 2020, we had foreign tax credits (\u201cFTC\u201d) carryforwards of $17.7 million that expire between 2021 and 2022. U.S. FTC carryforwards as of December 31, 2019 were $13.1 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had capital loss carryforwards of $19.3 million that expire between 2024 and 2035. Capital loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2019 were $16.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had valuation allowances of $79.4 million and $75.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, our valuation allowance consisted of $17.7 million for federal deferred tax assets related to FTC carryforwards, $42.4 million for state deferred tax assets related to operating loss carryforwards, and $19.3 million for federal and state deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryovers.\nWe estimate we will need to generate future federal taxable foreign source income of $84.4 million to fully realize FTC carryforwards before they expire in 2022. We estimate we will need to generate future taxable income of approximately $612.3 million for state income tax purposes during the respective realization periods (ranging from 2021 to 2040) to be able to fully realize the net deferred income tax assets discussed above. We estimate we will need to generate capital gain income of $67.4 million to fully realize our federal capital loss carryforwards before they expire in 2024 and 2025. We estimate we will need to generate capital gain income of $191.6 million to fully realize our state capital loss carryforwards before they expire between 2024 and 2035. Our ability to utilize deferred tax assets may be impacted by certain future events, such as changes in tax legislation or insufficient future taxable income prior to expiration of certain deferred tax assets.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nWe reviewed our position with regards to foreign unremitted earnings and determined that unremitted earnings will not be permanently reinvested as a result of the Sale. Accordingly, in 2020, we recorded foreign withholding taxes of $0.9 million on approximately $17.9 million of net undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In 2019, we recorded foreign withholding taxes of $0.8 million on approximately $14.0 million of net undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\n(1)\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the 2017 Tax Act, resulting in significant changes from existing U.S. tax laws that impact us, including, but not limited to, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, allowing immediate 100% deduction for the cost of qualified property, eliminating the domestic production activities deduction, and imposing a one-time transition tax in 2017 on the cumulative earnings and profits of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously not repatriated and therefore not taxed for U.S. income tax purposes. Our federal income tax expense is based on the new 21% rate for periods beginning in 2018.\nWe recognize the tax benefits of an uncertain tax position only if those benefits are more likely than not to be sustained based on existing tax law. Additionally, we establish a reserve for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained based on existing tax law, but uncertain in the ultimate benefit to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Unrecognized tax benefits are subsequently recognized at the time the more likely than not recognition threshold is met, the tax matter is effectively\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nsettled or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the tax position has expired, whichever is earlier.\nWe have $41.7 million of Unrecognized Tax Benefits (\u201cUTB\u201d) as of December 31, 2020, $18.4 million ($17.4 million, net of federal benefit) of this amount, if recognized in future periods, would impact the reported effective tax rate.\nIt is reasonably possible that certain UTB\u2019s may increase or decrease within the next twelve months due to tax examination changes, settlement activities, expirations of statute of limitations, or the impact on recognition and measurement considerations related to the results of published tax cases or other similar activities. Over the next twelve months we estimate that UTB\u2019s may decrease by $0.2 million related to state statutes expiring and increase by $1.5 million due to uncertain tax positions expected to be taken on domestic tax returns.\nWe account for all interest and penalties on uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense. We have $2.9 million of interest and penalties accrued in non-current income tax payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020.\nWe had the following activity for UTB\u2019s for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. and various states and international jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities in Canada and the United States. Generally, we have open tax years subject to tax audit on average of between three years and six years. The statute of limitations is no longer open for U.S. federal returns before 2016. With few exceptions, the statute of limitations is no longer open for state or non-U.S. income tax examinations for the years before 2014. With the exception of extending the 2016 statute of limitations to May 31, 2022 as a result of an ongoing Federal audit, we have not significantly extended any open statutes of limitation for any major jurisdiction and have reviewed and accrued for, where necessary, tax liabilities for open periods.\nNOTE 17. DEBT\nWe have a $1,000.0 million variable rate senior credit facility, which is comprised of a $500.0 million revolving credit facility (with a $150.0 million sublimit for letters of credit) and a $500.0 million Term Loan A. The revolving credit facility and Term Loan A are currently priced at 1.50% over LIBOR. The senior credit facility also has a $25.0 million letter of credit facility, also known as our bi-lateral facility. The revolving credit facility and Term Loan A mature in September 2024.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nOn September 30, 2019, we refinanced our senior credit facility. In connection with the refinancing, we paid $3.0 million of bank, legal and other fees, of which $2.9 million were capitalized. These fees are reflected as a component of long-term debt and amortized into interest expense over the terms of the underlying debt. Additionally, we wrote off $2.7 million of unamortized debt financing costs, included as a component of interest expense, related to our previous credit facility. Finally, in connection with the refinancing, we settled a $100.0 million notional interest rate swap as of September 30, 2019. See Note 20 for additional details.\nThe senior credit facility includes two financial covenants that require the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated cash interest expense minus cash consolidated interest income to be greater than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0 and requires the ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness, minus AWI and domestic subsidiary unrestricted cash and cash equivalents up to $100 million, to EBITDA to be less than or equal to 3.75 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants of the senior credit facility.\nOur debt agreements include other restrictions, including restrictions pertaining to the incurrence of additional debt, the redemption, repurchase or retirement of our capital stock, payment of dividends, and certain financial transactions as it relates to specified assets. We currently believe that default under these covenants is unlikely.\nDuring 2020, we borrowed and subsequently repaid $30.0 million under our Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility with the Bank of Nova Scotia (the \u201cfunding entity\u201d) which matured in September 2020. Interest on borrowings under this amended facility was calculated at a 90-day commercial paper rate. Under this facility, we sold accounts receivables to Armstrong Receivables Company, LLC (\u201cARC\u201d), a Delaware entity that is consolidated in these financial statements. ARC is a 100% wholly owned single member LLC special purpose entity created specifically for this transaction; therefore, any receivables sold to ARC were not available to the general creditors of AWI. ARC used this facility to borrow cash or issue letters of credit. When ARC borrowed cash under this facility, ARC sold an undivided percentage ownership interest in the purchased accounts receivables to the funding entity. We had the unilateral right to repurchase the funding entity\u2019s purchased interest in the accounts receivables and, as a result, borrowings under this facility were reported as debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Borrowings under this facility were obligations of ARC and not AWI. ARC contracted with and paid a servicing fee to AWI to manage, collect and service the purchased accounts receivables. All new receivables under the program were continuously purchased by ARC with the proceeds from collections of receivables previously purchased.\nNone of our remaining outstanding debt as of December 31, 2020 was secured with buildings and other assets. The credit lines under our revolving credit facility are subject to immaterial annual commitment fees.\nScheduled payments of long-term debt:\nWe utilize lines of credit and other commercial commitments in order to ensure that adequate funds are available to meet operating requirements. Letters of credit are currently arranged through our revolving credit facility and our bi-lateral facility. Letters of credit may be issued to third party suppliers, insurance and financial institutions and typically can only be drawn upon in the event of AWI\u2019s failure to pay its obligations to the beneficiary. The following table presents details related to our letters of credit facilities:\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nNOTE 18. PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PROGRAMS\nDEFINED CONTRIBUTION BENEFIT PLANS\nWe sponsor several defined contribution plans, which cover substantially all U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Eligible employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax covered compensation on an annual basis. We match employee contributions up to pre-defined percentages. Employee contributions are 100% vested. Employer contributions are vested based on pre-defined requirements. Costs for defined contribution benefit plans were $8.1 million in 2020, $7.7 million in 2019 and $6.3 million in 2018.\nDEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS\nBenefits from defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on an employee's compensation and years of service. We fund our pension plans when appropriate.\nOur U.S. defined benefit pension plans include both the qualified, funded RIP and the Retirement Benefit Equity Plan (\u201cRBEP\u201d), which is a nonqualified, unfunded plan designed to provide pension benefits in excess of the limits defined under Sections 415 and 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nDuring February 2020, we entered into agreements with Athene Annuity and Life Company (\u201cAAIA\u201d) and Athene Annuity & Life Assurance Company of New York (\u201cAANY\u201d) to transfer certain benefit obligations and assets of our U.S. Retirement Income Plan (\u201cRIP\u201d) to AAIA and AANY. Under the agreements, we effectively settled $1,045.3 million of retiree defined benefit pension obligations related to approximately 10,300 retirees and beneficiaries (the \u201cTransferred Participants\u201d), which were irrevocably transferred to AAIA and AANY and which guarantees the pension benefits of the Transferred Participants. During the third quarter of 2020, these amounts were immaterially adjusted due to customary data reconciliations with AAIA and AANY. The Agreement did not impact our benefit obligations under the RBEP.\nAs a result of the transaction, we recorded a $374.4 million settlement loss in the first quarter of 2020, which represented the release of amounts previously recorded in AOCI to other non-operating expense. The RIP\u2019s assets and liabilities were remeasured as of the settlement date, resulting in a remaining projected benefit obligation of $387.5 million, which covered approximately 3,000 deferred vested and active participants, and fair value of plan assets of $499.6 million. The discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation at the settlement date was 3.07%, compared to 3.16% used as of December 31, 2019. The expected long-term return on plan assets remained at 5.25% and did not change as a result of the settlement.\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, we offered an early retirement incentive benefit to employees at one of our manufacturing plants who met certain age and years of service criteria. The consideration period for eligible employees ended on September 30, 2020. Based on eligible employee elections to participate, we recorded a charge of $2.0 million within other non-operating expense, which increased the projected benefit obligation of the RIP. The enhanced retirement benefits did not result in a curtailment.\nWe have a defined benefit pension plan in Germany which was not acquired by Knauf in connection with the Sale. This plan uses assumptions which are consistent with, but not identical to, those of the U.S. plans. The accumulated benefit obligation for the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan was $2.9 million and $2.8 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following tables summarize the balance sheet impact of our U.S. defined benefit pension plans, as well as the related benefit obligations, assets, funded status and rate assumptions. We use a December 31 measurement date for all our defined benefit pension plans.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nBasis of Rate-of-Return Assumption\nLong-term asset class return assumptions for the RIP are determined based on input from investment professionals on the expected performance of the asset classes over 10 to 30 years. The forecasts were averaged to come up with consensus passive return forecasts for each asset class. Incremental components were added for the expected return from active management and asset class rebalancing based on historical information obtained from investment consultants. These forecasted gross returns were reduced by estimated management fees and expenses, yielding a long-term return forecast of 5.25% and 5.75% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans was $439.6 million and $1,429.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The largest contributor to the net actuarial losses affecting the benefit obligations for the defined benefit pension plans was a decrease in the discount rates, partially offset by the annuity premium gain in the RIP, an experience gain in the RBEP and other changes in assumptions.\nThe components of the pension cost (credit) for the U.S. defined benefit pension plans are as follows:\nFor 2020, 2019 and 2018, actuarial gains and losses were amortized over the remaining life expectancy of plan participants, which was approximately 28 years for 2020, 17 years for 2019 and 18 years for 2018 for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nInvestment Policies\nU.S. Pension Plans\nThe RIP\u2019s primary investment objective is to maintain the funded status of the plan such that the likelihood that we will be required to make significant contributions to the plan is limited. This objective is expected to be achieved by (a) investing a substantial portion of the plan assets in high quality corporate bonds whose duration is at least equal to that of the plan\u2019s liabilities, (b) investing in publicly traded equities in order to increase the ratio of plan assets to liabilities over time, (c) limiting investment return volatility by diversifying among additional asset classes with differing expected rates of return and return correlations, and (d) using derivatives to either implement investment positions efficiently or to hedge risk but not to create investment leverage.\nEach asset class utilized by the RIP has defined asset allocation targets and allowable ranges. The table below shows the asset allocation targets and the December 31, 2020 and 2019 positions for each asset class:\n(1)\nInvestments in collective trust funds as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 have been categorized within the asset classes above based on the underlying investments in those funds.\nPension plan assets are required to be reported and disclosed at fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.\nThe asset\u2019s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nThe following table sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy a summary of the RIP plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nThe RIP has investments in alternative investment funds as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 which are reported at fair value. These investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the tables above are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the total fair value of plan assets. We have concluded that the NAV reported by the underlying fund approximates the fair value of the investment. These investments are redeemable at NAV under agreements with the underlying funds. However, it is possible that these redemption rights may be restricted or eliminated by the funds in the future in accordance with the underlying fund agreements. Due to the nature of the investments held by the funds, changes in market conditions and the economic environment may significantly impact the NAV of the funds and, consequently, the fair value of the U.S. defined benefit pension plan asset\u2019s interest in the funds. Furthermore, changes to the liquidity provisions of the funds may significantly impact the fair value of the U.S. defined benefit pension plan asset\u2019s interest in the funds. As of December 31, 2020, there were no restrictions on redemption of these investments.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the RIP\u2019s investments measured at NAV:\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value and at NAV.\nBonds: Consists of registered investment funds and common and collective trust funds investing in fixed income securities tailored to institutional investors. There are no readily available market quotations for registered investment company funds. The fair value of investment funds and common and collective trust funds have been classified as Level 2 assets above as their values were derived based on the underlying securities in the fund\u2019s portfolio which is typically the amount which the fund might reasonably expect to receive for the security upon a current sale. Investments in pooled funds traded in a non-active market were valued at bid price and classified as Level 2 assets above.\nCollective trust fund: Represents collective trust and funds holding equity investments, fixed income securities, commodity futures contracts, cash and other short-term securities. The fair value of collective trust funds have been classified as Level 2 assets above as their values were derived based on the underlying securities in the fund\u2019s portfolio which is typically the amount which the fund might reasonably expect to receive for the security upon a current sale.\nReal estate: Consists of both open-end and closed-end funds. There are no readily available market quotations for these real estate funds. These investments were measured at fair value using the NAV practical expedient.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nOther investments: Consisted of investments in a group insurance annuity contract. Investments in the group insurance annuity contract were classified as Level 3 assets and measured at fair value by discounting the related cash flows based on current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations while considering the creditworthiness of the issuer.\nCash, other short-term investments and payables: Consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents, and plan receivables/payables. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and receivables/payables approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Other payables and receivables consist primarily of accrued fees and receivables related to investment positions liquidated for which proceeds had not been received as of December 31.\nU.S. DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREE HEALTH AND LIFE INSURANCE PLANS\nWe fund postretirement benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis, with the retiree paying a portion of the cost for health care benefits by means of deductibles and contributions.\nThe following tables summarize the balance sheet impact of the U.S. postretirement benefit pension plan, as well as the related benefit obligations, funded status and rate assumptions. We use a December 31 measurement date for all our defined benefit postretirement benefit plans.\nThe largest contributors to the actuarial losses affecting the benefit obligations for the postretirement plans were the decreases in the discount rates and the updates to the per capita claims assumptions.\nThe components of postretirement benefit (credit) are as follows:\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nFor measurement purposes, an average rate of annual increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits of 6.7% for pre-65 retirees and 7.6% for post-65 retirees was assumed for 2020, decreasing ratably to an ultimate rate of 4.5% in 2027.\nAmounts recognized in assets (liabilities) on the consolidated balance sheets at year end consist of:\nPre-tax amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income at year end consist of:\nThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid over the next ten years for our U.S. plans:\n(1)\nWe were not required and did not make contributions to the RIP during 2020, 2019 or 2018 as, based on guidelines established by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the RIP had sufficient assets to fund its distribution obligations. Benefit payments to RIP participants have been made directly from the RIP while benefit payments under the RBEP are made from Company cash.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nNOTE 19. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION\nWe do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. The estimated fair values of our financial instruments are as follows:\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The fair value estimates of long-term debt are based on quotes from a major financial institution of recently observed trading levels of our Term Loan A debt. The fair value estimates for interest rate swap contracts are estimated by obtaining quotes from major financial institutions with verification by internal valuation models. We engage independent, third-party valuation specialists to determine the fair value estimates for contingent consideration, which are based on a Monte Carlo simulation.\nThe fair value measurement of liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is summarized below:\nThe contingent consideration liability represents estimated future contingent purchase price payments related to the Moz and Turf acquisitions. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liability include the financial projections over the earn-out period, the volatility of the underlying financial metrics and estimated discount rates.\nThe following table summarizes the weighted-average of the significant unobservable inputs as of December 31, 2020:\nUnobservable inputs were weighted based on the relative fair value of the components of contingent consideration. See Note 5 for further information.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nThe changes in fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration liability for the year ended December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nNOTE 20. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices that could impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We use swaps to hedge interest rate exposures. At inception, interest rate swap derivatives that we designate as hedging instruments are formally documented as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or \u201ccash flow\u201d hedge. We also formally assess, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, or if the anticipated transaction is no longer probable of occurring, we discontinue hedge accounting and any future mark-to-market adjustments are recognized in earnings. We use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative trading purposes.\nCounterparty Risk\nWe only enter into derivative transactions with established financial institution counterparties having an investment-grade credit rating. We monitor counterparty credit default swap levels and credit ratings on a regular basis. All of our derivative transactions with counterparties are governed by master International Swap and Derivatives Association agreements (\u201cISDAs\u201d) with netting arrangements. These agreements can limit our exposure in situations where we have gain and loss positions outstanding with a single counterparty. We do not post nor do we receive cash collateral with any counterparty for our derivative transactions. These ISDAs do not have any credit contingent features; however, a default under our bank credit facility would trigger a default under these agreements. Exposure to individual counterparties is controlled and we consider the risk of counterparty default to be negligible.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe purchase natural gas and other various commodities for use in the manufacturing process. Although we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity pricing, we currently have no outstanding positions and do not expect to enter into any commodity derivative products.\nCurrency Rate Risk - Sales and Purchases\nAs of December 31, 2020, our only major foreign currency exposure is to the Canadian dollar. We currently have no outstanding positions and do not expect to enter into any foreign exchange derivative products.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe utilize interest rate swaps to minimize the fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges against changes in LIBOR for a portion of our variable rate debt. The following table summarizes our interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2020:\nUnder the terms of the November 2016 swap maturing in 2021, we receive 3-month LIBOR and pay a fixed rate over the hedged period, in addition to a basis rate swap to convert the floating rate risk under our November 2016 swap from 3-month LIBOR to 1-month LIBOR. As a result, we receive 1-month LIBOR and pay a fixed rate over the hedged period.\nUnder the terms of the November 2018 swap maturing in 2023, we pay a fixed rate over the hedged amount and receive 1-month LIBOR. This is inclusive of a 0% floor.\nUnder the terms of the forward starting November 2018 swap maturing in 2025, we will pay a fixed rate monthly and receive 1-month LIBOR. This is inclusive of a 0% floor.\nUnder the terms of the March 2020 swap maturing in 2022, we pay a fixed rate over the hedged amount and receive 1-month LIBOR. This is inclusive of a 0% floor.\nUnder the terms of the forward starting March 2020 swaps maturing in 2024, we will pay a fixed rate monthly and receive 1-month LIBOR. These are inclusive of a 0% floor.\nIn connection with the refinancing of our credit facility in September 2019, we settled a $100.0 million notional interest rate swap.\nFinancial Statement Impacts\nThe following tables detail amounts related to our derivatives as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. We did not have any derivative assets or liabilities not designated as hedging instruments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The derivative asset and liability amounts below are shown in gross amounts and have not been netted.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nAs of December 31, 2020, the amount of existing losses in AOCI expected to be recognized in earnings over the next twelve months is $8.4 million.\nNOTE 21. OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES\nNOTE 22. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS\nThe 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan (\u201c2016 LTIP\u201d) authorizes us to issue stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, stock units, performance-based awards and cash awards to officers and key employees and expires on July 8, 2026, after which time no further awards may be made. The 2016 LTIP authorizes us to issue up to 2,803,242 shares of common stock, which includes all shares that have been issued under the 2016 LTIP. As of December 31, 2020, 2,183,904 shares were available for future grants under the 2016 LTIP, excluding any future adjustments to shares for performance-based awards that have been previously granted.\nThe 2016 Directors Stock Unit Plan (\u201c2016 Director\u2019s Plan\u201d) authorizes us to issue stock units to non-employee directors until July 2026. The 2016 Director\u2019s Plan authorizes us to issue up to 250,000 shares of common stock, which includes all shares that have been issued under the 2016 Director\u2019s Plan. As of December 31, 2020, 167,218 shares were available for future grants under the 2016 Director\u2019s Plan.\nThe 2020 Inducement Award Plan (\u201c2020 Inducement Plan\u201d) authorizes us to issue stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and stock units to key employees and expires on December 14, 2030, after which time no further awards may be made. The 2020 Inducement Plan authorizes us to issue up to 19,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2020, 513 shares were available for future grants under the 2020 Inducement Plan.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nThe following table presents stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2020:\nWe have reserved sufficient authorized shares to allow us to issue new shares upon exercise of all outstanding options. Options generally become exercisable in three years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. When options are exercised, we may issue new shares, use treasury shares (if available), acquire shares held by investors, or a combination of these alternatives in order to satisfy the option exercises.\nThe following table presents information related to stock option exercises:\nThe fair value of option grants was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. There have been no option grants since 2014.\nWe also grant non-vested stock awards in the form of Restricted Stock Units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) and Performance Stock Units (\u201cPSUs\u201d). A summary of the 2020 activity related to the RSUs and PSUs is as follows:\nRSUs entitle the recipient to a specified number of shares of AWI\u2019s common stock provided the prescribed service period is fulfilled. PSUs entitle the recipient to a specified number of shares of AWI\u2019s common stock provided the defined financial targets are achieved at the end of the performance period. Upon vesting, final adjustments based upon financial achievements are reflected as performance adjustments in the table above. RSUs and PSUs generally have vesting periods of three years at the grant date. RSUs and PSUs earn dividends during the vesting period that are subject to forfeiture if the awards do not vest.\nThe table above includes 895 PSUs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, which are accounted for as liability awards as they are able to be settled in cash. Employee liability awards outstanding for all periods represent awards to certain employees of our former EMEA and Pacific Rim businesses, which vest when the appropriate performance period ends. These awards will be distributed in the second quarter of 2021.\nRSUs and PSUs with non-market based performance conditions are measured at fair value based on the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. In 2020 and 2019, we granted 42,698 and 58,430 PSUs, respectively, with market-based performance conditions that are valued through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation. The weighted average assumptions for PSUs measured at fair value through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation are presented in the table below.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nThe risk-free rate of return was determined based on the implied yield available on zero coupon U.S. Treasury bills at the time of grant with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the PSUs. In 2019, the expected volatility was based on an average of the actual historical volatilities of the stock prices of AWI and a peer group of companies. We elected to not rely solely on AWI\u2019s actual historical stock price volatility due to the separation of AFI in 2016. In 2020, the expected volatility was based on the actual historical volatilities of the stock prices of AWI. The expected term represented the performance period on the underlying award. The expected dividend yield was assumed to be zero under the assumption that dividends distributed during the performance period are reinvested in AWI\u2019s common stock.\nIn connection with our recent acquisition of Arktura, we issued 75,743 shares of restricted stock to the sellers as of the acquisition date, which are not reflected in the non-vested stock awards table above. These awards to sellers were not issued under the 2020 Inducement Plan and have a vesting period of five years from the grant date and earn dividends during the vesting period, which are subject to forfeiture if the awards do not vest. We also issued 18,487 Restricted Stock Awards (\u201cRSAs\u201d) under the 2020 Inducement Plan to key employees as of the acquisition date, which are not reflected in the non-vested stock awards table above. These key employee awards have a vesting period of three years from the grant date and earn dividends during the vesting period, which are subject to forfeiture if the awards do not vest. If forfeited, the key employee awards will transfer to the Arktura sellers. We reissued treasury shares to grant all of the restricted stock and RSAs associated with the Arktura acquisition.\nIn addition to the equity awards described above, as of December 31, 2020 we had 11,773 fully-vested phantom shares outstanding for non-employee directors under the 2006 Phantom Stock Unit Plan not reflected in the non-vested stock awards table above. These awards are settled in cash and had vesting periods of one to three years. The awards are generally payable six months following the director\u2019s separation from service on the Board of Directors. The total liability recorded for these shares as of December 31, 2020 was $1.2 million which includes associated non-forfeitable dividends. This liability was settled on January 5, 2021. The 2006 Phantom Stock Unit Plan is still in place; however, no additional shares will be granted under the plan.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 126,474 and 140,417 RSUs, respectively, outstanding under the 2016 Directors Stock Unit Plan not reflected in the non-vested stock awards table above. In 2020 and 2019, we granted 12,278 and 9,981 restricted stock units, respectively, to non-employee directors. These awards generally have a vesting period of one year, and as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, 114,196 and 130,436 shares, respectively, were vested but not yet delivered. The awards are generally payable upon vesting or the director\u2019s deferral election. These awards earn dividends during the vesting period that are subject to forfeiture if the underlying award does not vest.\nWe recognize share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Share-based compensation cost was $6.9 million ($5.1 million net of tax benefit) in 2020, $8.4 million ($6.3 million net of tax benefit) in 2019, and $12.9 million ($9.6 million net of tax benefit) in 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was $17.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.1 years.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nNOTE 23. EMPLOYEE COSTS\nNOTE 24. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCommon Stock Repurchase Plan\nSince July 29, 2016, our Board of Directors has approved our share repurchase program pursuant to which we are currently authorized to repurchase up to $1,200.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock through December 31, 2023 (the \u201cProgram\u201d). The Program was temporarily suspended in the first quarter of 2020 in response to uncertainties surrounding COVID-19. On October 21, 2020, we elected to restart the Program and had $593.8 million remaining under the Board\u2019s repurchase authorization as of December 31, 2020.\nRepurchases under the Program may be made through open market, block and privately-negotiated transactions, including Rule 10b5-1 plans, at such times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate, subject to market and business conditions, regulatory requirements and other factors. The Program does not obligate AWI to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice.\nDuring 2020, we repurchased 0.5 million shares under the Program for a total cost of $44.4 million, excluding commissions, or an average price of $87.27 per share. Since inception, we have repurchased 9.7 million shares under the Program for a total cost of $606.2 million, excluding commissions, or an average price of $62.35 per share.\nDividends\nIn February, April and July 2020, our Board of Directors declared $0.20 per share quarterly dividends, which were paid to shareholders in March, May and August 2020, respectively. In October 2020, our Board of Directors declared a $0.21 per share quarterly dividend, which was paid to shareholders in November 2020. On February 17, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a $0.21 per share quarterly dividend to be paid in March 2021.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss)\nThe balance of each component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss), net of tax is presented in the table below.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nThe amounts and related tax effects allocated to each component of other comprehensive income for 2020, 2019, and 2018 are presented in the tables below.\nThe following table summarizes the activity, by component, related to the change in AOCI for December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n(1)\nAmounts are net of tax\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nThe amounts reclassified from AOCI and the affected line item of the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income are presented in the table below.\n(1)\nRepresents amounts reclassified out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss during 2019 related to the Sale and included as a component of (loss) gain from disposal of discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. A portion of these amounts were included in our previously reported estimated loss on sale. See Note 6 for additional details.\nNOTE 25. SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nNOTE 26. RELATED PARTIES\nIn some geographies and for some customers, we purchase grid products from WAVE, our 50%-owned joint venture with Worthington, for resale to customers. The total amount of these purchases was $21.5 million in 2020, $22.5 million in 2019 and $22.5 million in 2018. We also provide certain selling, promotional and administrative processing services to WAVE for which we receive reimbursement. Those services amounted to $20.7 million in 2020, $15.7 million in 2019, and $15.8 million in 2018. The net amount due to WAVE from us for all of our relationships was $4.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and $3.3 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we also recorded a $25.9 million payable to WAVE for their remaining portion of the proceeds from the Sale, which was reflected within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the December 31, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheet and paid to WAVE during 2020. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNOTE 27. LITIGATION AND RELATED MATTERS\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nEnvironmental Compliance\nOur manufacturing and research facilities are affected by various federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of materials and the protection of the environment. We make expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable environmental requirements at each of our operating facilities. While these expenditures are not typically material, the applicable regulatory requirements continually change and, as a result, we cannot predict with certainty the amount, nature or timing of future expenditures associated with environmental compliance.\nEnvironmental Sites\nSummary\nWe are actively involved in the investigation and remediation of existing or potential environmental contamination under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d) and state Superfund and similar environmental laws at two domestically owned locations allegedly resulting from past industrial activity.\nIn each location, we are one of multiple potentially responsible parties and have agreed to jointly fund the required investigation and remediation, while preserving our defenses to the liability. We may also have rights of contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under applicable insurance policies. We are currently pursuing coverage and recoveries under those policies with respect to certain of the sites, including the Macon, GA site and the Elizabeth City, NC site, each of which is summarized below. These efforts have included two active and independent litigation matters against legacy primary and excess policy insurance carriers for recovery of fees and costs incurred by us in connection with our investigation and remediation activities for such sites. As described below, the litigation matter in Oregon relating to the St. Helens, OR site was dismissed in the second quarter of 2019 in connection with our settlement with the State of Oregon. Other than disclosed below, we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters or the timing of any recoveries, whether through settlement or otherwise. We are also unable to predict the extent to which any recoveries might cover our final share of investigation and remediation costs for these sites. Our final share of investigation and remediation costs may exceed any such recoveries, and such amounts net of insurance recoveries may be material.\nBetween 2017 and 2019, we entered settlement agreements totaling $39.8 million with certain legacy insurance carriers to resolve ongoing litigation and recover fees and costs previously incurred by us in connection with certain environmental sites. These settlements were recorded as a $9.2 million reduction to cost of goods sold and a $30.6 million reduction to SG&A expenses reflecting the same income statement categories where environmental expenditures were historically recorded. In 2020, we entered into settlement agreements totaling $12.7 million, $7.7 million of which was recorded as a reduction to SG&A expenses. During the fourth quarter of 2020, cumulative insurance recoveries exceeded cumulative expenses to date related to the respective environmental sites and the excess $5.0 million was recorded within our long-term liabilities as of December 31,2020. The excess recoveries will be released to offset any future expenses incurred on the respective environmental sites. We anticipate that we may enter into additional settlement agreements in the future, which may or may not be material, with other legacy insurers to obtain reimbursement or contribution for environmental site expenses.\nEstimates of our future liability at the environmental sites are based on evaluations of currently available facts regarding each individual site. We consider factors such as our activities associated with the site, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations and prior company experience in remediating contaminated sites. Although current law imposes joint and several liability on all parties at Superfund sites, our contribution to the remediation of these sites is expected to be limited by the number of other companies potentially liable for site remediation. As a result, our estimated liability reflects only our expected share. In determining\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nthe probability of contribution, we consider the solvency of other parties, the site activities of other parties, whether liability is being disputed, the terms of any existing agreements and experience with similar matters, and the effect of our October 2006 Chapter 11 reorganization upon the validity of the claim, if any.\nSpecific Material Events\nSt Helens, OR\nIn August 2010, we entered into a Consent Order (the \u201cConsent Order\u201d) with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (\u201cODEQ\u201d), along with Kaiser Gypsum Company, Inc. (\u201cKaiser\u201d), and Owens Corning Sales LLC (\u201cOC\u201d), with respect to our St. Helens, Oregon facility, which was previously owned by Kaiser and then OC. The Consent Order required the parties to complete a remedial investigation and feasibility study on the upland, lowland and in-water portions of the site.\nThrough voluntary mediation in November 2017 with ODEQ, OC and Kaiser, we reached settlement with ODEQ documented in a Public Notice and proposed consent judgment (\u201cConsent Judgment\u201d); in exchange for a release from ODEQ for all contamination claims against us, we would pay $8.6 million to the State of Oregon and perform a previously scoped remedial action for the upland area. We submitted the settlement payment to ODEQ and completed the remedial action for the upland area in 2019.\nODEQ approved a final Upland Operable Unit Remedial Action Construction Completion and Final Closeout Report and issued a Conditional No Further Action Determination, including the Easement and Equitable Servitude, which was recorded in Columbia County, Oregon. On February 24, 2020, ODEQ filed the Certification of Completion for the satisfactory completion of the work conducted by us pursuant to the Consent Judgment. As a result of the settlements with ODEQ and Kaiser, and these actions by ODEQ, we do not expect to incur any future material costs relating to this matter.\nMacon, GA\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) has listed two landfills located on a portion of our facility in Macon, GA, along with the former Macon Naval Ordnance Plant landfill adjacent to our property, portions of Rocky Creek, and certain tributaries leading to Rocky Creek (collectively, the \u201cMacon Site\u201d) as a Superfund site on the National Priorities List due to the presence of contaminants, most notably polychlorinated biphenyls (\u201cPCBs\u201d).\nIn September 2010, we entered into an Administrative Order on Consent for a Removal Action (the \u201cRemoval Action\u201d) with the EPA to investigate PCB contamination in one of the landfills on our property, the Wastewater Treatment Plant Landfill (the \u201cWWTP Landfill,\u201d also known as \u201cOperable Unit 1\u201d). After completing an investigation of the WWTP Landfill and submitting our final Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis, the EPA issued an Action Memorandum in July 2013 selecting our recommended remedy for the Removal Action. The Operable Unit 1 response action for the WWTP Landfill is complete and the final report was submitted to the EPA on October 11, 2016. The EPA approved the final report on November 28, 2016, and a Post-Removal Control Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d) was submitted to the EPA on March 28, 2017. That Plan will monitor the effectiveness of the WWTP Landfill response action over a five-year period and our estimate of future liabilities includes these tasks.\nIt is probable that we will incur field investigation, engineering and oversight costs associated with a remedial investigation and feasibility study (\u201cRI/FS\u201d) with respect to the remainder of the Superfund site, which includes the other landfill on our property, as well as areas on and adjacent to our property and Rocky Creek (the \u201cRemaining Site,\u201d also known as \u201cOperable Unit 2\u201d). On September 25, 2015, AWI and other Potential Responsible Parties (\u201cPRPs\u201d) received a Special Notice Letter from the EPA under CERCLA inviting AWI and the PRPs to enter into the negotiation of an agreement to conduct an RI/FS of Operable Unit 2. We and the other PRPs entered into a settlement agreement with the EPA effective September 18, 2018, in response to the Special Notice Letter to conduct the RI/FS. The PRPs submitted a complete RI/FS work plan in the second quarter of 2019, which the EPA approved on September 11, 2019. Investigative work on this portion of the site commenced in December 2019. Ecological field work and risk evaluation remains ongoing. We anticipate that the EPA will require significant investigative work for Operable Unit 2. We may ultimately incur costs in remediating any contamination discovered during the RI/FS. The current estimate of future liability at this site includes only our estimated share of the costs of the investigative work that, at this time, we anticipate the EPA will require the PRPs to perform. We are unable to reasonably estimate our final share of the total costs associated with the investigation work or any resulting remediation therefrom, although such amounts may be material to any one quarter's or year's results of operations in the future. However, we do not expect the total future costs to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or financial condition as the cash payments may be made over many years.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nElizabeth City, NC\nThis site is a former cabinet manufacturing facility that was operated by Triangle Pacific Corporation, now known as Armstrong Wood Products, Inc. (\u201cTriangle Pacific\u201d or \u201cAWP\u201d), from 1977 until 1996. The site was formerly owned by the U.S. Navy (\u201cNavy\u201d) and Westinghouse, now CBS Corporation (\u201cCBS\u201d). We assumed ownership of the site when we acquired the stock of Triangle Pacific in 1998. Prior to our acquisition, the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources listed the site as a hazardous waste site. In 1997, Triangle Pacific entered into a cost sharing agreement with Westinghouse whereby the parties agreed to share equally in costs associated with investigation and potential remediation. In 2000, Triangle Pacific and CBS entered into an Administrative Order on Consent to conduct an RI/FS with the EPA for the site. In 2007, we and CBS entered into an agreement with the Navy whereby the Navy agreed to pay one third of defined past and future investigative costs up to a certain amount, which has now been exhausted. The EPA approved the RI/FS work plan in August 2011. In January 2014, we submitted the draft Remedial Investigation and Risk Assessment reports and conducted supplemental investigative work based upon agency comments to those reports. In connection with the separation of AFI in 2016, we agreed to retain any legacy environmental liabilities associated with the AWP site. The EPA published an Interim Action Proposed Plan for the site in April 2018 seeking public comment through June 7, 2018. The EPA evaluated comments, including ours, and has published its Interim Record Of Decision selecting an interim cleanup approach. On September 25, 2018, AWI and CBS received a Special Notice Letter from the EPA under CERCLA inviting AWI and CBS to enter into the negotiation of a settlement agreement to conduct or finance the response action at the site. During the third quarter of 2018, we increased our reserve for the cost of the interim cleanup, which we expect to be shared with CBS and the Navy. In response to the September 2018 Special Notice Letter, AWI and CBS submitted a good faith offer to EPA on May 28, 2019, and negotiations among parties remain ongoing. The current estimate of future liability at this site includes only our estimated share of the costs of the interim remedial action that, at this time, we anticipate the EPA will require the PRPs to perform. We are unable to reasonably estimate our final share of the total costs associated with the final remediation or any resulting remediation therefrom, although such amounts may be material to any one quarter's or year's results of operations in the future. However, we do not expect the total future costs to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or financial condition as the cash payments may be made over many years.\nSummary of Financial Position\nTotal liabilities of $1.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and $1.6 million as of December 31, 2019 were recorded for environmental liabilities that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the probable liability could be made. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, were reflected within accounts payable and accrued expenses. During 2020, we did not record any additional reserves for potential environmental liabilities. During 2019, we recorded reserves for potential environmental liabilities of $1.0 million. Where existing data is sufficient to estimate the liability, that estimate has been used; where only a range of probable liabilities is available and no amount within that range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. As assessments and remediation activities progress at each site, these liabilities are reviewed to reflect new information as it becomes available and adjusted to reflect amounts actually incurred and paid. These liabilities are undiscounted.\nThe estimated environmental liabilities above do not take into account any claims for additional recoveries from insurance or third parties. It is our policy to record insurance recoveries as assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets when probable. We incur costs to pursue environmental insurance recoveries, which are expensed as incurred.\nActual costs to be incurred at identified sites may vary from our estimates. Based on our knowledge of the identified sites, it is not possible to reasonably estimate future costs in excess of amounts already recognized.\nOTHER CLAIMS\nOn September 8, 2017, Roxul USA, Inc. (d/b/a Rockfon) (\u201cRockfon\u201d) filed litigation against us in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the \u201cCourt\u201d) alleging anticompetitive conduct seeking remedial measures and unspecified damages. Roxul USA, Inc. is a significant ceilings systems competitor with global headquarters in Europe and expanding operations in the Americas. On April 3, 2019, we entered into a confidential settlement agreement with Rockfon to fully resolve the litigation between us, and Rockfon filed a Stipulation of Dismissal with Prejudice (\u201cDismissal\u201d) with the Court. Pursuant to the Dismissal, Rockfon formally dismissed all claims it had against AWI with prejudice. All claims in the litigation have been fully and finally dismissed and released with AWI making a payment to Rockfon for its costs, expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees. Pursuant to the settlement, both parties acknowledged that (a) AWI denies all claims of wrongdoing and makes no admission of wrongdoing or of the truth of any of the claims or allegations contained in Rockfon\u2019s complaint or otherwise alleged in the litigation; (b) all AWI exclusive distribution locations (i.e., any location where a reseller has agreed to sell only AWI ceiling system products) will remain exclusive to AWI under their respective distribution agreements, and (c) in all other non-exclusive or \u201copen\u201d distribution locations, resellers are free to purchase and resell ceiling systems products of any manufacturer at their discretion. During the first six months of 2019, we incurred $19.7 million of expenses in connection with the matter, primarily relating to legal and professional fees incurred by us in connection with the litigation, including expenses and attorney\u2019s fees paid under the settlement agreement. As a result of the settlement and Dismissal, we do not expect to incur additional future costs or expenses relating to the matter.\nArmstrong World Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollar amounts in millions, except share data)\nFrom time to time, we are involved in other various lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal matters that arise in the ordinary course of business, including matters involving our products, intellectual property, relationships with suppliers, relationships with distributors, relationships with competitors, employees and other matters. In connection with those matters, we may have rights of contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under applicable insurance policies. When applicable and appropriate, we will pursue coverage and recoveries under those policies, but are unable to predict the outcome of those demands. While complete assurance cannot be given to the outcome of any proceedings relating to these matters, we do not believe that any current claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nNOTE 28. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nEarnings per share components may not add due to rounding.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of (loss) earnings to (loss) earnings attributable to common shares used in our basic and diluted (Loss) Earnings Per Share (\u201cEPS\u201d) calculations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. EPS components may not add due to rounding.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of basic shares outstanding to diluted shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (shares in millions):\nDue to the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, all common stock equivalents were considered anti-dilutive. Anti-dilutive options excluded from the computation of dilutive EPS for 2020 and 2019 were 313,003 and 7,580, respectively. There were no anti-dilutive stock options excluded from the computation of diluted EPS in 2018.",
