    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nAndrea Electronics Corporation (\u201cAndrea,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d) designs, develops and manufactures state-of-the-art digital microphone products and noise reduction software that facilitate natural language processing, human/machine interfaces. Our technologies eliminate unwanted background noise to enable the optimum performance of various speech-based and audio applications. We are incorporated under the laws of the State of New York and have been engaged in the electronic communications industry since 1934.\nAndrea\u2019s products and technologies optimize the performance of speech-based applications and audio applications primarily in the following markets:\n\u25cf Speech recognition applications;\n\u25cf Communications; and\n\u25cf Audio and video recording.\nAndrea Digital Signal Processing (\u201cDSP\u201d) Microphone and Audio Software Business - Our patented digital noise canceling technologies enable a speaker to be at a distance from the microphone (we refer to this capability as \u201cfar-field\u201d microphone use) and free the speaker from having to use a close talking microphone. Our Digital Super Directional Array (\u201cDSDA\u201d) and PureAudio microphone products convert sound received by an array of microphones into digital signals that are then processed to cancel background noise from the signal to be transmitted. These two adaptive technologies represent the core technologies within our portfolio of far-field technologies. In addition to DSDA and PureAudio, Andrea has developed and commercialized several other digital, far-field noise canceling technologies, including, among others, Andrea EchoStop, a high-quality full duplex acoustic echo canceller which enables speakerphone functionality with technology for canceling speaker feedback.\nAll of our digital, far-field microphone technologies are software-based and operate using either a dedicated DSP or a general purpose processor (for example, the Intel Pentium). The software, which may encompass one or all of our far-field noise canceling technologies, can be applied to improve the performance of a single microphone or multiple microphones. In addition, our digital, far-field, noise canceling technologies can be tailored to be used individually or combined depending on particular customer requirements.\nWe are currently marketing our far-field technologies at Original Equipment Manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) that have new sophisticated artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) voice applications that require new digital microphone performance for enhancing the safe use and efficiency of devices. Our far-field, digital noise canceling technologies and related products comprise our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software line of business. Net revenues from such technologies and products during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately 100% of our total revenues. We dedicate a significant amount of our marketing and research and development resources to this business segment, as we believe that voice interface products will increasingly require high performance, touchless microphone technology.\nPatent Monetization, Intellectual Property and Licensing - Our products and technologies are developed in part using our proprietary intellectual property, and we believe that the strength of our intellectual property rights will be important to the success of our business. We utilize patent and trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements with customers and partners, disclosure and invention assignment agreements with employees and consultants and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary information. We plan to license specific, custom designs to our customers, charging royalties at a fixed amount per product or a percentage of sales. More generally, we intend to vigorously defend and monetize our intellectual property through licensing arrangements and, where necessary, enforcement actions against those entities using our patented solutions in their products. Royalties resulting from these patent monetization efforts can be structured in a variety of ways, including but not limited to one-time paid up licenses or on-going royalty arrangements. We expect to generate a portion of our revenues with these types of licensing arrangements. As part of our plan to aggressively pursue patent monetization, we entered into a Revenue Sharing and Note Purchase Agreement (the \u201cRevenue Sharing Agreement\u201d) with AND34 Funding LLC (\u201cAND34\u201d), which was effective as of February 14, 2014. Under the Revenue Sharing Agreement, the Company granted AND34 a perpetual predetermined share in the rights of the Company\u2019s specified future revenues from currently owned patents. Under the terms of the Revenue Sharing Agreement, Andrea issued and sold to AND34 Notes which were repaid as of December 31, 2016. In 2016, 2017 and 2019, the parties executed and subsequently amended a rider to the Revenue Sharing Agreement (the \u201cRider\u201d) pursuant to which Andrea agreed to issue and sell to AND34 a specified amount of additional Notes (the \u201cAdditional Notes\u201d), or such greater amount as AND34 may agree to in its sole discretion. The most recent rider executed in 2019 increased the aggregate principal amount from $7,500,000 to $11,500,000. The Additional Notes have a maturity date of August 31, 2022. The proceeds of the Additional Notes will be used to pay certain expenses related to the Revenue Sharing Agreement and expenses of the Company incurred in pursuing patent monetization. As of December 31, 2020, there was $2,093,967 in Additional Notes and PIK interest outstanding. Total revenues from this segment during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were minimal, representing less than 1% of our total revenues.\nFor more financial information regarding our operating segments, see Note 14 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nIndustry Background\nOur primary mission is to provide the emerging \u201cvoice interface\u201d markets with state-of-the-art digital microphone solutions. The idea underlying these markets is AI natural language processing of the human voice will become an important means by which to communicate and control many types of computing devices and other appliances and equipment that contain microprocessors and cloud services. We are designing and marketing our products and technologies so they can be used for \u201cnatural language, human/machine\u201d interfaces including:\n\u25cf Amazon Alexa\u2122\n\u25cf Google Now\u2122\n\u25cf IBM Watson\u00ae\n\u25cf Microsoft Cortana\u2122\nEnd users of these applications and interfaces will require high quality microphone and speakerphone products that enhance voice transmission, particularly in noisy outdoor and public environments. We also believe that these applications will increasingly require microphones that are located at a distance from the person speaking, or far-field microphone technology. Due to changing marketing conditions as a result of COVID 19, we believe that there will be significant growth in this touchless technology marketplace during the next several years.\nOur Strategy\nOur strategy is to:\n\u25cf maintain and advance our market position with our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software technologies and products;\n\u25cf broaden our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software product lines through a healthy level of internal research and development;\n\u25cf design our products to satisfy specific end-user requirements identified by our collaborative partners;\n\u25cf develop relationships with companies that have significant distribution capabilities for our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software technologies and products;\n\u25cf outsource manufacturing of our products in order to reduce fixed overhead and achieve economies of scale; and\n\u25cf vigorously defend and monetize our intellectual property through licensing arrangements and, where necessary, enforcement actions against those entities using our patented solutions in their products.\nAn important element of our strategy for expanding our industrial and commercial channels broadening the base of users for our products is increasing our own direct business to business marketing efforts to original equipment manufacturers for incorporation into, or for use with, their products.\nThe success of our strategy will depend on our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf increase total revenues of Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software products;\n\u25cf continue to contain costs;\n\u25cf introduce additional Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software products;\n\u25cf maintain the competitiveness of our technologies through focused and targeted research and development;\n\u25cf achieve widespread adoption of our products and technologies through ongoing marketing efforts; and\n\u25cf defend and monetize our intellectual property.\nOur Technologies\nWe design our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software to transmit voice signals with the high level of quality, intelligibility and reliability required by the broad range of voice-based applications in cloud computing. We achieve this through the use of several audio technologies that employ software processes that are proprietary to us. Software processes of this type are commonly referred to as algorithms.\nAndrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Technology\nThis set of technologies is generally based on the use of an array of microphones from which the analog signals are converted to digital form and then processed using digital electronic circuitry and software to eliminate unwanted noise in the speaker\u2019s environment. Our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products provide clear acoustic and audio input performance where the desired audio signal is at a distance from the microphone. Our technology is portable and can be embedded into new platforms such as micro DSP\u2019s, mobile OS and wireless chipsets. We believe that our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software technology achieve far-field microphone performance previously unattainable through microphones based on mechanical acoustic designs and microphones based on analog signal processing.\nOur Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products include the use of the following technologies, among other technologies and techniques:\nDigital Super Directional Array (\u201cDSDA\u201d\u00ae). Andrea\u2019s patented DSDA adaptive beam forming system enables more intelligible audio by forming a beam toward the speaker and eliminating background noises that are outside of the beam. DSDA microphone technology enables high quality far-field communications by centering microphone sensitivity on a user\u2019s voice and canceling noise outside of that signal. DSDA continuously samples the ever changing acoustic parameters within an environment and adaptively identifies interfering noises that are extraneous to the voice signal, resulting in increased intelligibility of the array microphone\u2019s output.\nPureAudio\u00ae. Andrea\u2019s patented PureAudio and award winning noise reduction speech enhancement algorithm significantly improves intelligibility of voice audio and accuracy in speech driven applications used in noisy environments. PureAudio is a noise canceling algorithm that enhances speech by sampling the ambient noise in an environment and attenuating the noise from sources near or around the desired speech signals, thus delivering a clear audio signal. Designed specifically to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, PureAudio is effective in canceling stationary noises such as computer and ventilation fans, tires and engines.\nEchoStop\u00ae. Andrea\u2019s patented full duplex acoustic echo cancellation algorithm enables both loudspeakers to broadcast and microphones to transmit simultaneously providing a high quality speakerphone function. EchoStop is an advanced acoustic echo canceller (stereo version available) developed for use with conferencing systems such as group audio and videoconferencing systems and cellular car phone kits. EchoStop allows true two-way communication (often referred to as full duplex) over a conferencing system, even when the system is used in large spatial environments that may be vulnerable to extensive reverberation. EchoStop incorporates noise reduction to reduce the background noise of both the microphone input and the loudspeaker output, thus preventing the accumulation of interfering noise over conferencing systems that facilitate communication among multiple sites.\nDirection Finding and Tracking Array (\u201cDFTA\u201d\u00ae). Andrea\u2019s patented DFTA technology utilizes an array of microphones and a unique algorithm to detect the presence of a user\u2019s voice, determine the direction of the voice and follow and track it when it moves. In a videoconferencing setting, this unique technology can provide direction to a videoconferencing camera and allow the system to steer and concentrate on the speaker, thus providing a \u201cvideo-follow-audio\u201d capability.\nOur Products and their Markets and Applications\nOur Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products have been designed for applications that are controlled by or depend on speech across a broad range of hardware and software platforms. These products incorporate our DSP microphone technologies and are designed to cancel background noise in a range of noisy environments, such as homes, offices, factories and automobiles. We also manufacture a line of accessories for these products. For commercial markets, we have designed our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products for the following applications:\n\u25cf Mass transit and automotive communication systems;\n\u25cf Automated teller machines;\n\u25cf Information kiosks;\n\u25cf Quick Service Restaurant Automated Ordering;\n\u25cf Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d);\n\u25cf Smart building entrance intercom systems;\n\u25cf Audio and Video recording; and\n\u25cf Video surveillance.\nAndrea DSP Microphone and Audio Noise Reduction Software Products\nWe develop our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Noise Reduction Software Products primarily through customer-specific integration efforts, and we either license our related algorithms, sell a product incorporating our related algorithms, or both. In addition, we have developed stand-alone products for specific industrial and commercial OEM customers. As a result, such products are not generally sold to consumers. Therefore, as part of our strategy to increase sales to prospective customers desiring high-quality microphone performance for certain customer-specific environments, we have developed the following products:\nDA-350 Auto Array Microphone (\u201cDA-350\u201d). The DA-350 is a linear four element array microphone with Digital Signal Processing (\u201cDSP\u201d) circuitry contained within a single microphone housing. The product also has integrated adaptive beam forming and noise reduction digital filtering software. The DA-350 is ideal for achieving superior far-field voice intelligibility and accuracy of Automatic Speech Recognition (\u201cASR\u201d) in automotive and mass transit environments.\nDA-250 OEM Array Microphone (\u201cDA-250\u201d). The DA-250 is a small compact Stereo Array Microphone and DSP circuit board platform that can easily be integrated into many different OEM devices that would greatly benefit from directional noise canceling microphone performance, but in the past has been unattainable with an embedded microphone configuration. Requiring only two tiny holes in the faceplate of a device, the DA-250 Stereo Array Microphone can deliver directional microphone sensitivity without the need for acoustic baffling, as found in shotgun tube type microphones. This product also includes full duplex echo cancellation for speakerphone functionality.\nUSB-SA Array Microphone. The USB-SA Array Microphone provides a USB digital audio adapter to bypass a computer\u2019s standard integrated sound system, providing a high fidelity/low noise digital audio platform that is isolated from the computer\u2019s motherboard. This external digital audio system utilizes the computer\u2019s central processor to run Andrea\u2019s AudioCommander\u2122 adaptive beam forming directional microphone and noise reduction software.\nAndrea AudioCommander\u2122. Andrea\u2019s PC Audio Control Panel, AudioCommander, includes a speaker volume adjustment with received PureAudio noise reduction control and a 10-band graphic equalizer with 18 built-in presets to customize sound for a user\u2019s listening preference. It also includes a microphone volume adjustment with noise reduction, beam forming, and acoustic echo cancellation controls. The software also includes an audio wizard that sets microphone levels to optimize PC audio for speech-enabled applications including speech recognition, internet telephony and command and speech control functions.\nAndrea Audio Software for Mac. Andrea Audio Software for Mac provides an intuitive graphic user interface to control stereo array microphone beam forming, noise cancellation on the input and EQ filters for the output of Andrea\u2019s USB-SA audio devices running on the Apple Mac OS.\nAndrea PureAudio Live Recorder. PureAudio\u2122 Live Recorder is a full function digital voice and audio recording application for use with Apple\u2122 iOS devices. The PureAudio\u2122 Live Recorder is enhanced with Andrea's patented digital noise reduction microphone technology. PureAudio\u2122 digitally reduces background noise, while enhancing the recorded sound quality and intelligibility when making recordings in real-world noisy mobile environments.\nAndrea PureAudio Plus Recorder. In addition to the features offered in PureAudio Live Recorder, PureAudio Plus Recorder offers unlimited bookmarks for easy navigation of large recordings, 10-band graphic equalizer to customize your listening experience, aggressive PureAudio for recording in noisy environments, stereo recording for capturing surround sound recordings and beam forming noise cancellation to reduce sounds coming from the sides. PureAudio Plus Recorder is an easy to use, intuitive stereo recorder for capturing music and offers background noise reduction for crystal clear recordings of voice notes, lectures and interviews with almost unlimited recording time.\nOur Collaborative Arrangements\nAn important element of our strategy is to promote widespread adoption of our products and technologies by collaborating with large enterprises and market and technology leaders in security systems and services, industrial system integrators, voice activated services, communications and computer manufacturing. In addition to the arrangements we are involved in, we are currently discussing additional arrangements with other companies, but we cannot assure you that any of these discussions will result in any definitive agreements.\nPatents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights\nOur products and technologies are developed in part using our proprietary intellectual property, and we believe that the strength of our intellectual property rights will be important to the success of our business. We utilize patent and trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements with customers and partners, disclosure and invention assignment agreements with employees and consultants and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary information. We plan to license specific, custom designs to our customers, charging royalties at a fixed amount per product or a percentage of sales. More generally, we intend to vigorously defend and monetize our intellectual property through licensing arrangements and, where necessary, enforcement actions against those entities using our patented solutions in their products. Royalties resulting from these patent monetization efforts can be structured in a variety of ways, including but not limited to one-time paid up licenses or on-going royalty arrangements. We expect to generate a portion of our revenues with these types of licensing arrangements.\nAndrea maintains a number of patents in the United States covering claims to certain of its products and technology, which expire at various dates up to 2029. We cannot assure you that the strength or scope of our patents, or any new patents, will be of sufficient scope or strength or provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us.\nResearch and Development\nWe consider our technology to be of substantial importance to our competitiveness. To maintain this competitiveness, we have organized our research and development efforts using a \u201cmarket and applications\u201d approach for meeting the requirements of new and existing customers. Consistent with this approach, our engineering staff interacts closely with our sales and marketing personnel and directly with customers. The engineering staff is responsible for the research and development of new products and the improvement and support of existing products. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, total research and development expenses were $573,980 and $568,799, respectively. For fiscal 2021, we currently expect research and development expenses to remain at approximately the same level when compared to 2020. However, no assurance can be given that our research and development efforts will succeed. See Part II \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nSales and Marketing\nWe employ a sales staff as well as outside sales representatives to market our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products. Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products are marketed to computer and kiosk OEMs and industrial system integrators. Under our existing collaborative agreements, our collaborators have various marketing and sales rights to our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software. We are seeking to enter into additional collaborative arrangements for the marketing and sale of our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products, but we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts. Market acceptance of the Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products and achievement of patent monetization is critical to our success.\nProduction Operations\nIn 2020 and 2019, all of our assembly operations were performed with subcontractors in the United States or in Asia. Most of the components for the Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products are available from several sources and are not characteristically in short supply. However, certain specialized components, such as microphones and DSP boards, are available from a limited number of suppliers and subject to long lead times. To date, we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of these more specialized components, but we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to do so. Shortages of, or interruptions in, the supply of these more specialized components could have a material adverse effect on our sales of Andrea DSP Microphone Products.\nCompetition\nThe markets for our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products are highly competitive. Competition in these markets is based on varying combinations of product features, quality and reliability of performance, price, sales, marketing and technical support, ease of use, compatibility with evolving industry standards and other systems and equipment, name recognition, and development of new products and enhancements. Most of our current and potential competitors in these markets have significantly greater financial, marketing, technical, and other resources than us. Consequently, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the development, marketing, and sale of their products than we can.\nWe believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend upon our ability to develop and maintain advanced technology, develop proprietary products, attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent or other proprietary protection for our products and technologies and manufacture, assemble and market products, either alone or through third parties, in a profitable manner.\nEmployees\nAt December 31, 2020, we had nine employees, of whom one was engaged in production and related operations, three were engaged in research and development, and five were engaged in management, administration, sales and customer support duties. None of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we generally enjoy good relations with our employees. In addition to our regular employees, we utilize eight independent consultants (two are sales representatives, two are engaged for administration purposes and four are engaged in research and development activities).\nAvailable Information\nWe file reports, including our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on From 8-K and amendments to those reports, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). The SEC maintains an internet site that contains such reports, proxy, and information statements and other information regarding issuers at http://www.sec.gov. Our website is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K.",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAndrea is a party to the Revenue Sharing Agreement under which a perpetual predetermined share of its Monetization Revenues will be allocated to AND34 and under which a default could cause a material adverse effect on its financial position.\nUnder the Revenue Sharing Agreement that we entered into with AND34, Monetization Revenues will first be applied 100% to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on, and then will be allocated to AND34 and the Company in accordance with certain predetermined percentages. During each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $200,000 of notes payable were issued to AND34. At December 31, 2020, there was $2,093,967 of accrued and unpaid interest and related outstanding principal notes issued to AND34. The Revenue Sharing Agreement contains many stipulations between the parties regarding the handling of various matters related to the monetization of our patents. Following an Event of Default, under the Revenue Sharing Agreement and the Rider, AND34 may proceed to protect and enforce its rights by suit or other appropriate proceeding, either for specific performance or in aid of the exercise of any power granted under the Revenue Sharing Agreement, the Rider or ancillary documents including the notes.\nAndrea is limited in its ability to get traditional funding.\nThe terms of the Revenue Sharing Agreement historically expressly prohibited the Company from incurring any other indebtedness in connection with the patents covered by the Revenue Sharing Agreement and collateral outside of the patents covered by the Revenue Sharing Agreement, barring certain exceptions. Such restrictions contained in the Revenue Sharing Agreement terminated on June 30, 2020 and no longer prohibit the Company from incurring additional indebtedness. However, in order to incur third party indebtedness, the Company would need to offer some form of collateral and currently much of the Company\u2019s intellectual property is serving as collateral in connection with the Revenue Sharing Agreement. In addition, the conversion price adjustment provisions of the Company\u2019s Series C and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, and the current low quotation price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the OTCQB limit our ability to get traditional funding.\nOur operating results are subject to significant fluctuation; period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely on them as indications of our future performance.\nOur results of operations have historically been and are subject to continued substantial annual and quarterly fluctuations. The causes of these fluctuations include, among other things:\n\u25cf the volume of sales of our products under our collaborative marketing arrangements;\n\u25cf the cost of development of our products;\n\u25cf the mix of products we sell;\n\u25cf the mix of distribution channels we use;\n\u25cf the timing of our new product releases and those of our competitors;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the computer and communications hardware and software marketplace; and\n\u25cf general economic conditions.\nWe cannot assure you that the level of revenues and gross profit, if any, that we achieve in any particular fiscal period will not be significantly lower than in other fiscal periods. Our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $1,355,000 and $1,895,000, respectively. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $824,000, or $0.01 net loss per share on a basic and diluted basis, versus net loss of approximately $549,000, or $0.01 net loss per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the year ended December 31, 2019. We continue to explore opportunities to grow sales in other business areas and vigorously defend and monetize our intellectual property.\nShares eligible for future sale may have an adverse effect on market price; Andrea shareholders may experience substantial dilution.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could have the effect of depressing the prevailing market price of our common stock. Of the 200,000,000 shares of common stock presently authorized, 68,104,957 were outstanding as of March 23, 2021. The number of shares outstanding does not include an aggregate of 20,454,812 shares of common stock that are issuable. This number of issuable common shares is equal to approximately 30% of the 68,104,957 outstanding shares. These issuable common shares are comprised of: a) 6,301,500 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding awards granted under our 2006 Stock Plan; b) 10,000,000 shares reserved for future grants under our 2019 Plan; c) 524,736 shares of common stock that are issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock and related accrued dividends; and d) 3,628,576 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock.\nConversions of our Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock may result in substantial dilution to other holders of our common stock.\nAs of March 23, 2021, we had 11.469249 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and 907,144 shares of Series D Preferred Stock outstanding. The issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock is limited to that amount which, after giving effect to the conversion, would cause the holder not to beneficially own in excess of 4.99% or, together with other shares beneficially owned during the 60-day period prior to such conversion, not to beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the outstanding shares of common stock. The issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock also is limited to that amount which, after giving effect to the conversion, would cause the holder not to beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, except that each holder has a right to terminate such limitation upon 61 days\u2019 notice to us. Beneficial ownership for purposes of calculation of such percentage limitations does not include shares whose acquisition is subject to similar limitations. If all shares of the Series C and Series D Preferred Stock, which are outstanding to be issued, are assumed to be converted into or exercised for shares of common stock, the number of new shares of common stock required to be issued as a result would aggregate 4,153,312 shares, which is equal to approximately 6% of the 68,104,957 outstanding shares.\nIf we conduct offerings in the future, the price at which we offer our securities may trigger a price protection provision for our Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock.\nThe shares of Series C and Series D Preferred Stock are subject to antidilution provisions, which are triggered in the event of certain stock splits, recapitalizations, or other dilutive transactions. In addition, issuances of common stock at a price below the conversion price then in effect (currently $0.2551 and $0.25 for the Series C and Series D, respectively), or the issuance of warrants, options, rights, or convertible securities which have an exercise price or conversion price less than that conversion price, other than for certain previously outstanding securities and certain \u201cexcluded securities\u201d (as defined in the certificate of amendment), require the adjustment of the conversion price to that lower price at which shares of common stock have been issued or may be acquired. In the event that Andrea issues securities in the future which have a conversion price or exercise price which varies with the market price and the terms of such variable price are more favorable than the conversion price in the Series C or Series D Preferred Stock, the purchasers may elect to substitute the more favorable variable price when making conversions of the Series C or Series D Preferred Stock. This would make it more likely that the Series C and Series D Preferred Stock would be converted into common stock, resulting in dilution to our other holders of common stock as outlined in the risk factor above.\nShort sales of our common stock may be attracted by or accompany conversions of Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock, which sales may cause downward pressure upon the price of our common stock.\nShort sales of our common stock may be attracted by or accompany the sale of converted common stock, which in the aggregate could cause downward pressure upon the price of the common stock, regardless of our operating results, thereby attracting additional short sales of the common stock.\nIf we fail to commercialize and fully market our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software products, our total revenues may not increase at a high enough rate to improve our results of operations or may not increase at all.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition depend on the successful commercialization of our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software products and technologies. We introduced our first Andrea DSP Microphone products in 1998 and we continued to introduce complementary products and technologies over the last several years. We primarily target the computer market, the audio and video conferencing markets and the market for in-vehicle computing, among others. The success of these products is subject to the risks frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of product commercialization, particularly companies in the computing and communications industries.\nIf we are unable to obtain market acceptance of Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software products and technologies, or if market acceptance of these products and technologies occurs at a slow rate, then our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe, and our competitors, are focused on developing and commercializing products and technologies that enhance the use of voice, particularly in noisy environments, for a broad range of computer and communications applications. These products and technologies have been rapidly evolving and the number of our competitors has grown, but the markets for these products and technologies are subject to a high level of uncertainty and have been developing slowly. We, alone or together with our industry, may be unsuccessful in obtaining market acceptance of these products and technologies.\nIf we fail to develop and successfully introduce new products and technologies in response to competition and evolving technology, we may not be able to attract new customers or retain current customers.\nThe markets in which we sell our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software products are highly competitive. We may not compete successfully with any of our competitors. Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, research and development, marketing, technical support and other resources than we do. Consequently, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the development, marketing, and sale of their products than we can. The introduction of products incorporating new technologies could render our products obsolete and unmarketable and could exert price pressures on existing products.\nWe are currently engaged in the development of digital signal processing products and technologies for the voice, speech and natural language interface markets. We may not succeed in developing these new digital signal processing products and technologies, and any of these new digital signal processing products or technologies may not gain market acceptance.\nFurther, the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by evolving industry and government standards and specifications that may require us to devote substantial time and expense to adapt our products and technologies. For example, certain of our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software products are subject to the Federal Communications Commission requirements. We may not successfully anticipate and adapt our products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner to changes in technology and industry standards or to introductions of new products and technologies by others that render our then existing products and technologies obsolete.\nIf our marketing collaborators do not effectively market their products that include or incorporate our products, our sales growth will be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into collaborative and distribution arrangements with software publishers and computer hardware manufacturers relating to the marketing and sale of Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software products through inclusion or incorporation with the products of our collaborators. Our success is dependent to a substantial degree on the efforts of these collaborators to market their products that include or incorporate our products. Our collaborators may not successfully market these products. In addition, our collaborators generally are not contractually obligated to any minimum level of sales of our products or technologies, and we have no control over their marketing efforts. Furthermore, our collaborators may develop their own microphone products and technologies that may replace our products or technologies or to which they may give higher priority.\nShortages of, or interruptions in, the supply of more specialized components for our products could have a material adverse effect on our sales of these products.\nThe majority of our assembly operations are fulfilled by subcontractors (primarily in Asia) using purchased components. Some specialized components for the Andrea DSP Microphone products, such as microphones and digital signal processing boards, are available from a limited number of suppliers (and in some cases foreign) and subject to long lead times. We may not be able to continue to obtain sufficient supplies of these more specialized components, particularly if the sales of our products increase substantially or market demand for these components otherwise increases. If our subcontractors fail to meet our production and shipment schedules, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the United States.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s components and products are manufactured in whole or in part by a few third-party manufacturers. Many of these manufacturers are located outside of the United States. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. If manufacturing or logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason, including but not limited to, natural disasters, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to compete may be limited by our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property or by patents granted to third parties.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, and nondisclosure agreements with our employees, independent contractors, licensees and potential licensees, limited access to and dissemination of our proprietary information, and other measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. However, the steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent its misappropriation or circumvention. In addition, numerous patents have been granted to other parties in the fields of noise cancellation, noise reduction, computer voice recognition, digital signal processing and related subject matter. We expect that products in these fields will increasingly be subject to claims under these patents as the numbers of products and competitors in these fields grow and the functionality of products overlap. Claims of this type could have an adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and market our products or to develop new products and technologies, because the parties holding these patents may refuse to grant licenses or only grant licenses with onerous royalty requirements. Moreover, the laws of other countries do not protect our proprietary rights to our technologies to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the recent coronavirus outbreak.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. In January 2020, COVID-19 spread to other countries, including the United States, and efforts to contain the spread of this coronavirus intensified. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders and other public health measures were implemented across much of the United States, including the Long Island area, which was considered an epicenter of the outbreak and is where the Company is located. Due to \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders and other public health guidance measures, the Company had implemented a work-from-home policy for all staff members. The Company\u2019s increased reliance on personnel working from home may negatively impact productivity, or disrupt, delay or otherwise adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation. Although the Company has not yet had any customers cancel any open orders, some customers have delayed shipments of products into future months, causing our 2020 product revenues through December 31, 2020 to be approximately $400,000 less than the same period in 2019.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which the outbreak may affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, such as the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, travel restrictions and actions to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, such as social distancing and quarantines or lock-downs in the United States and elsewhere, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and elsewhere to contain and treat the disease, including the speed of the ongoing vaccine distribution effort. Future developments in these and other areas present material uncertainty and risk with respect to the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected if there is a default on the Payment Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) Loans and/or the SBA Loan.\nThe Company entered into two PPP loans with HSBC Bank USA, N.A. in an aggregate principal amount of $285,552, pursuant to a program which was established under the CARES Act, whereby the Company received $142,775 in its first draw in May 2020 (the \u201cPPP Loan First Draw\u201d) and $142,777 in its second draw in February 2021 (the \u201cPPP Loan Second Draw\u201d and together with the PPP Loan First Draw, the \u201cPPP Loans\u201d). Under the terms of the CARES Act, recipients can apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of loans granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds for certain permissible purposes as set forth in the PPP, including, but not limited to, payroll costs (as defined under the PPP) and mortgage interest, rent or utility costs and the maintenance of employee and compensation levels. On January 18, 2021, the PPP Loan First Draw was forgiven, barring an initial $8,000 advance. No assurance is provided that the Company will obtain forgiveness of the remaining amount of the PPP Loan First Draw or any of the PPP Loan Second Draw; therefore, the Company may be liable for paying the outstanding balances of the PPP Loans back.\nThe PPP Loans contain customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults or breach of representations and warranties. If the PPP Loans are not forgiven, the Company may default on the PPP Loans and trigger the immediate repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or the Lender filing suit and obtaining judgment against the Company.\nAdditionally, the Company entered into the SBA Loan pursuant to which the Company received loan proceeds of $150,000. The SBA Loan was made under, and is subject to the terms and conditions of, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program, which was a program expanded for COVID-19 relief under the CARES Act and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. The term of the SBA Loan is thirty (30) years with a maturity date of July 13, 2050 and the annual interest rate of the SBA Loan is a fixed rate of 3.75%. Under the terms of the CARES Act, the use of loan proceeds for the SBA Loan is limited to alleviating economic injury caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the SBA Loan for such purpose.\nWhile the SBA Loan does not allow for forgiveness like the PPP Loans, there are similar risks of default for the SBA Loan.\nAn unfavorable ruling in any current litigation proceeding or future proceeding may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation incidental to our business. For example, we are subject to the risk of adverse claims, interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, oppositions to patent applications outside the United States, and litigation alleging infringement of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation to establish the validity of patents, to assert infringement claims against others, and to defend against patent infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming, even if the outcome is in our favor.\nFor example, as discussed in Part II \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d of this Form 10-K, we are currently involved in appealing an unfavorable ruling by the ITC in our patent infringement claims against Apple Inc. In line with our business strategy, we have dedicated significant resources to vigorously prosecuting these patent infringement claims, and not succeeding on these claims could be detrimental to our Company.\nChanges in economic and political conditions outside the United States could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe generate revenues from regions outside the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, total revenues from sales to customers outside the United States accounted for approximately 23% and 25%, respectively, of our total revenues. International sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf trade restrictions in the form of license requirements;\n\u25cf restrictions on exports and imports and other government controls;\n\u25cf changes in tariffs and taxes;\n\u25cf difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u25cf problems in establishing and managing distributor relationships;\n\u25cf general economic conditions; and\n\u25cf political and economic instability or conflict.\nTo date, we have invoiced our international revenues in U.S. dollars and have not engaged in any foreign exchange or hedging transactions. We may not be able to continue to invoice all of our revenues in U.S. dollars in order to avoid engaging in foreign exchange or hedging transactions. If we are required to invoice any material amount of international revenues in non-U.S. currencies, fluctuations in the value of non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition or require us to incur hedging costs to counter such fluctuations.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain the necessary managerial, technical and other personnel necessary for our business, then our business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of the services of any of these executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified managers and technical personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense and we may not be able to attract, motivate or retain qualified personnel in the future.\nWe have significantly less financial resources than most of our competitors which limits our ability to implement new products or enhancements to our current products and may require us to implement future restructuring plans, which could adversely affect our future sales and financial condition.\nFinancial resource constraints could limit our ability to execute our product strategy or require us to implement restructuring plans, particularly if we are unable to generate cash from operations or obtain additional sources of financing. Any future restructuring actions may slow our development of new or enhanced products by limiting our research and development and engineering activities. Our cash balances are also lower than those of our competitors, which may limit our ability to develop competitive new products on a timely basis. If we are unable to successfully introduce new or enhanced products, our sales and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nA significant amount of our business involves licensing our proprietary software, a strategy that increases business risk and volatility.\nWe have licensed certain of our proprietary software to third parties and may seek to enter into additional license arrangements in the future. We cannot assure you, however, that others will be interested in licensing our software on commercially favorable terms or at all. We also cannot ensure that licensees will honor agreed-upon market restrictions, not infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property or maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information.",

    "item_3": "ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nIn September 2016, the Company filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleging patent infringement against Apple Inc. (\u201cApple\u201d) and requesting monetary and injunctive relief (the \u201cNew York Litigation\u201d). The New York Litigation was stayed pending final disposition of a parallel case that the Company filed against Apple with the United States International Trade Commission (\u201cITC\u201d). The ITC\u2019s final decision finding that Apple did not violate the ITC\u2019s statute was issued on March 22, 2018. Apple informed the New York judge of this final decision on May 30, 2018. The ITC\u2019s final decision does not affect Andrea\u2019s right to continue prosecuting the New York litigation.\nIn January 2017, Apple filed four (4) petitions for inter partes review (\u201cIPR\u201d) of the Company\u2019s patents asserted in the New York Litigation with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d). The Company filed its Patent Owner\u2019s Preliminary Response in two of these IPR proceedings on May 1, 2017. The PTO instituted the four IPR proceedings requested by Apple on July 24, 2017. The Company filed its Patent Owner\u2019s Response in two of these IPR proceedings on November 7, 2017. Oral argument in these two IPR proceedings, occurred on April 25, 2018. On July 12, 2018, the PTO issued its final written decisions in those two IPR proceedings, ruling that claims 6-9 of the Company\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 6,363,345 remain valid and enforceable after the PTO\u2019s review. On September 13, 2018, Apple filed its Notice of Appeal of that ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the \u201cFederal Circuit\u201d). Apple filed its Appeal Brief with the Federal Circuit on January 31, 2019. The Company filed its Response to Apple\u2019s Appeal Brief on March 12, 2019. The Federal Circuit held an oral argument on October 1, 2019. On February 7, 2020, the Federal Circuit issued its decisions on Apple\u2019s appeals. The Federal Circuit affirmed the PTO\u2019s findings in one of the ongoing IPRs. In the other ongoing IPR, the Federal Circuit partly affirmed the PTO\u2019s findings, but also partly vacated the PTO\u2019s findings, and remanded the case back to the PTO for further proceedings. On remand of the ongoing IPR, on October 28, 2020, the PTO found that claims 6-9 of the Company\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 6,363,345 are invalid. The Company has appealed this decision to the Federal Circuit.\nThe New York Litigation is stayed pending the final outcome of Apple\u2019s IPR proceedings against the Company\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 6,363,345.\nAndrea intends to vigorously prosecute the New York Litigation and the ongoing IPR proceedings.",

    "item_7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nOur primary mission is to provide the emerging \u201cvoice interface\u201d markets with state-of-the-art digital microphone products and noise reduction software that facilitate AI natural language processing of the human voice/machine interfaces.\nExamples of the applications and interfaces for which Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products provide benefits include: internet and other computer-based speech; telephony communications; multi-point conferencing; speech recognition; and other applications and interfaces that incorporate natural language processing. We believe that end users of these applications and interfaces will require high quality microphone and earphone products that enhance voice transmission, particularly in noisy environments, for use with personal computers, mobile personal computing devices, cellular and other wireless communication devices and automotive communication systems. Our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products use \u201cfar-field\u201d digital signal processing technology to provide high quality transmission of voice where the user is at a distance from the microphone. High quality audio communication technologies will be required for emerging far-field voice applications, ranging from continuous speech dictation, to internet telephony and multiparty video teleconferencing and collaboration, to natural language-driven interfaces for automobiles, home and office automation and other machines and devices into which voice-controlled microprocessors are expected to be introduced during the next several years.\nOur Critical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management's discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities and determination of revenues and expenses in the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. On a continual basis, management reviews its estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such reviews, and if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different and/or future circumstances. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and 2) changes in the estimate, or the use of different estimating methods that could have been selected, could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nThe following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements have been identified. In addition to the recording and presentation of our convertible preferred stock, we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. We have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our Audit Committee. The following critical accounting policies are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the Company\u2019s accounting policies or estimates.\nRevenue Recognition - On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d (Topic 606) (\u201cASU No. 2014-09\u201d), which is described below in Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In accordance with Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue using the following five-step approach:\n1. Identify the contract with a customer.\n2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract.\n3. Determine the transaction price of the contract.\n4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\n5. Recognize revenue when the performance obligations are met or delivered.\nAndrea utilizes the modified retrospective approach when reviewing its current accounting policies to identify potential differences that would result from applying the new requirements to its customer contracts. This approach includes the evaluation of sales terms, performance obligations, variable consideration, and costs to obtain and fulfill contracts. Based on the Company\u2019s review, management did not need to record a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of initial application and application of this guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company disaggregates its revenues into three contract types: (1) product revenues, (2) service related revenues and (3) license revenues and then further disaggregates its revenues by operating segment. Generally, product revenue is comprised of microphones and microphone connectivity product revenues. Product revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligation by transferring promised goods to a customer. Product revenue is measured at the transaction price, which is based on the amount of consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring the promised goods to the customer. Contracts with customers are comprised of customer purchase orders, invoices and written contracts. Customer product orders are fulfilled at a point in time and not over a period of time. The Company does not have arrangements for returns from customers and does not have any future obligations directly or indirectly related to product resale by customers. The Company has no sales incentive programs. Service related and licensing revenues are recognized based on the terms and conditions of individual contracts using the five step approach listed above, which identifies performance obligations and transaction price. Typically, Andrea receives licensing reports from its licensees approximately one quarter in arrears due to the fact that its agreements require customers to report revenues between 30-60 days after the end of the quarter. Under this accounting policy, the licensing revenues reported are not based upon estimates. In addition, service related revenues, which are short-term in nature, are generally performed on a time-and-material basis under separate service arrangements and the corresponding revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed.\nAccounts Receivable - We are required to estimate the collectability of our trade receivables. Judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables, including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances. We evaluate specific accounts when we become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability, credit ratings or bankruptcy. The reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. Our reserves are also determined by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $4,789.\nInventories - We are required to state our inventories at net realizable value. In assessing the ultimate realization of inventories, we are required to make considerable judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with our current inventory levels. Our reserve requirements generally increase as our projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions, technological and product life cycle changes occur, as well as longer than previously expected usage periods. We have evaluated the current levels of inventories, considering historical total revenues and other factors and, based on this evaluation, recorded adjustments to cost of revenues to adjust inventories to net realizable value. We had inventories of $114,393 and $210,161 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. It is possible that additional charges to inventory may occur in the future if there are further declines in market conditions, or if additional restructuring actions are taken.\nLong Lived Assets - ASC 360 \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d (\u201cASC 360\u201d) requires management judgments regarding the future operating and disposition plans for marginally performing assets, and estimates of expected realizable values for assets to be sold. Andrea accounts for its long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 360 for purposes of determining and measuring impairment of its other intangible assets. Andrea\u2019s policy is to periodically review the value assigned to its long lived assets to determine if they have been permanently impaired by adverse conditions which may affect Andrea. If required, an impairment charge would be recorded based on an estimate of future discounted cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate undiscounted future operating cash flows and fair values and, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. No impairment charges were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nDeferred Tax Assets - We currently have significant deferred tax assets. ASC 740, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d (\u201cASC 740\u201d), requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. Furthermore, ASC 740 provides that it is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. Therefore, cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment. Accordingly, and after considering changes in previously existing positive and negative evidence, the Company determined that a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets was required. Andrea will reduce its valuation allowance in future periods to the extent that we can demonstrate our ability to utilize the assets. The future realization of a portion of our reserved deferred tax assets related to tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options, if and when realized, will not result in a tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations, but rather will result in an increase in additional paid in capital. We will continue to re-assess our reserves on deferred income tax assets in future periods on a quarterly basis.\nContingencies - We are subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims, including proceedings under laws and government regulations related to securities, environmental, labor, product and other matters. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of legal counsel. The amount of any reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter.\nThe impact of changes in the estimates and judgments pertaining to revenue recognition, receivables and inventories is directly reflected in our segments\u2019 loss from operations. Although any charges related to our deferred tax provision are not reflected in our segment results, the long-term forecasts supporting the realization of those assets and changes in them are significantly affected by the actual and expected results of each segment.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain information contained in this Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and other items set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The words \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cseeks,\u201d variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and industry, our beliefs and certain assumptions made by our management. Investors are cautioned that matters subject to forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect our business and prospects. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are based on current expectations and speak as of the date of such statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise. In order to obtain the benefits of these \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions for any such forward-looking statements, we caution investors and prospective investors about the following significant factors, which, among others, have in some cases affected our actual results and are in the future likely to affect our actual results and could cause them to differ materially from those expressed in any such forward-looking statements. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries include, but are not limited to, our ability to enforce our patents, changes in economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors, such as the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and the PPP Loans, that may affect our business and prospects. Additional factors are discussed in Part I, \u201cItem 1A - Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nResults Of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nTotal Revenues\n(a) The decrease of approximately $335,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, in revenues from automotive array microphone products is primarily the result of timing of sales to integrators of public safety and mass transit vehicle solutions because of COVID-19.\n(b) The decrease of approximately $120,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, in revenues of OEM array microphone products is primarily the result of decreased product revenues from integrators of commercial product audio solutions because of COVID-19.\n(c) The decrease of approximately $25,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, from customized digital product revenues is related to the timing of purchases from an OEM customer because of COVID-19.\n(d) The decrease of approximately $79,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, in all other Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Product revenues is primarily the result of timing in revenues from sales to the China market for audio solutions.\n(e) The increase of approximately $20,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, is primarily the result of increased service revenue of approximately $31,000 related to engineer services partially offset by decreased royalties reported as a result of a decrease in sales of PC models which feature our technology.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased to 23% from 28% for the year ended December 31, 2019. There was no cost of revenues associated with the Patent Monetization revenues of $554 and $950 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 for Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products was 23% compared to 28% for the year ended December 31, 2019. These changes are primarily the result of the changes in the product mix of revenues as described under \u201cTotal Revenues\u201d above.\nPatent Monetization Expenses\nPatent monetization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 14% to $166,694 from $194,215 for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of timing of legal services incurred to pursue patent monetization. These expenses are a result of our continuing efforts to pursue patent monetization, including the filing of the complaints disclosed under Part I, \u201cItem 3 -Legal Proceedings\u201d of this Form 10-K. Such patent monetization is a key component of our business strategy.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 1% to $573,980 from $568,799 for the year ended December 31, 2019. These expenses primarily relate to costs associated with the development of new products. For the year ended December 31, 2020, research and development expenses reflected a 22% decrease in our Patent Monetization efforts to $18,908 or 3% of total research and development expenses, and a 2% increase in our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Technology efforts to $555,072, or 97% of total research and development expenses. With respect to DSP Microphone and Audio Software technologies, research efforts are primarily focused on the pursuit of commercializing a natural language-driven human/machine interface by developing optimal far-field microphone solutions for various voice-driven interfaces, incorporating Andrea\u2019s digital super directional array microphone technology, and certain other related technologies such as noise suppression and stereo acoustic echo cancellation. We believe that continued research and development spending should benefit Andrea in the future.\nGeneral, Administrative and Selling Expenses\nGeneral, administrative and selling expenses decreased by approximately 1% to $1,058,980 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1,070,654 for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, there was a 1% decrease in our Patent Monetization efforts to $177,206, or 17% of total general, administrative and selling expenses and a 1% decrease in general, administrative and selling expenses in our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Technology efforts to $881,774, or 83% of total general, administrative and selling expenses. The overall 1% decrease of approximately $12,000 is primarily related to decreased stock based compensation expense.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $68,020, compared to interest expense, net of $70,133 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $619, compared to $1,805 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is a result of certain licensing revenues that are subject to withholding of income tax as mandated by the foreign jurisdiction in which the revenues of approximately $3,000 and $9,000 for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are earned.\nNet loss\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $823,835 compared to a net loss of $548,566 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 principally reflects the factors described above.\nInflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business and operating results during the periods presented, and we do not expect it to have a material impact in the near future, although there can be no assurances that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on its consolidated financial condition, changes in consolidated financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nLiquidity And Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2020, we had cash of $362,730 compared to $335,790 at December 31, 2019. The increase in our cash balance at December 31, 2020 is primarily a result of proceeds of the Additional Notes received in connection with the Revenue Sharing Agreement, the SBA Loan and the PPP Loan partially offset by cash used in operating activities.\nOur working capital balance at December 31, 2020 was $321,491 compared to working capital of $556,850 at December 31, 2019. The decrease in working capital reflects a decrease in total current assets of $196,347 and an increase in total current liabilities of $39,012. The decrease in total current assets reflects an increase in cash of $26,940, a decrease in accounts receivable of $195,308, a decrease in inventories of $95,768 and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $67,789. The increase in total current liabilities reflects an increase in trade accounts payable and other current liabilities of $29,033 and an increase in the current portion of long-term debt of $9,979.\nThe increase in cash of $26,940 reflects $448,543 of net cash used in operating activities, plus $25,292 of net cash used in investing activities, partially offset by $500,775 of net cash provided by financing activities.\nThe cash used in operating activities of $448,543, excluding non-cash charges, is primarily attributable to the $823,835 net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, a $194,689 decrease in accounts receivable, a $104,948 decrease in inventories, a $67,790 increase in prepaid expenses, other current assets and other assets, and a $19,078 decrease in trade accounts payable and other current liabilities and lease liabilities. The changes in receivables, inventories and trade accounts payable primarily reflect differences in the timing related to both the payments for and the acquisition of inventory as well as for other services in connection with ongoing efforts related to Andrea\u2019s operations.\nThe cash used in investing activities of $25,292 reflects a $19,303 increase in patents and trademarks and purchases of property and equipment of $5,989. The increase in patents and trademarks reflects capital expenditures associated with our intellectual property. The increase in property and equipment is associated with the purchases of computer equipment.\nThe cash provided by financing activities of $500,775, reflects $200,000 of proceeds from long-term debt, $158,000 from the SBA Loan and $142,775 from the PPP Loan First Draw.\nWe plan to improve our cash flows in 2021 by aggressively pursuing monetization of our patents related to our Andrea DSP Microphone Audio Software to result in increased licensing arrangements, increasing the sales of our Andrea DSP Microphone Audio Software Products through the introduction of new products, as well as our increased efforts toward our sales and marketing efforts. As of March 23, 2021, Andrea had approximately $340,000 of cash deposits. We cannot assure you that demand will continue for any of our products, including future products related to our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software technologies, or, that if such demand does exist, that we will be able to obtain the necessary working capital to increase production and provide marketing resources to meet such demand on favorable terms, or at all.\nMarket Risk\nHistorically, our principal source of financing activities had been the issuance of convertible preferred stock with financial institutions. We are affected by market risk exposure primarily through any amounts payable in stock, or cash by us under convertible securities. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates or for any other purpose. In addition, substantially all transactions entered into by us are denominated in U.S. dollars. As such, we have shifted foreign currency exposure onto our foreign customers. As a result, if exchange rates move against foreign customers, we could experience difficulty collecting unsecured accounts receivable, the cancellation of existing orders or the loss of future orders. For the year ended December 31, 2020, total revenue from sales to customers outside the United States accounted for approximately 23% of our total revenue. The foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",

Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 is effective.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately and fairly reflect, in reasonable detail, transactions and dispositions of assets; and provide reasonable assurances that: (1) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; (2) receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (3) unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are prevented or timely detected.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of\nAndrea Electronics Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Andrea Electronics Corporation and Subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders\u2019 deficit and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nGoing Concern Assessment\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements have been issued. The Company has current year and historical losses, cash flows used in operations and adverse change in the business climate based on the impacts of COVID-19. Management believes, based on the Company\u2019s cash balances, current working capital, loan proceeds from a Paycheck Protection Program loan and projected future revenues, the Company will be able to satisfy their obligations as they come due for at least one year from the financial statement issuance date. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company\u2019s ability to successfully execute its business plan and generate profitable operations in the future.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company\u2019s assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern is a critical audit matter are the significant judgement by management in the estimation of the Company\u2019s future cash flows and the risk of bias in managements judgments and assumptions in estimating these cash flows.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the Company\u2019s assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern included the following, among others:\nWe tested the reasonableness of the forecasted revenue, operating expenses and uses and sources of cash in management\u2019s assessment of liquidity to fund operations for at least one year from the financial statement issuance date. This testing included inquiries with management, comparison of prior period forecasts to actual results, consideration of positive and negative evidence impacting managements forecasts and reviewing customer purchase orders and/or forecasts used in the projections.\n/s/ Marcum LLP\nMarcum LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2002.\nMelville, NY\nMarch 31, 2021\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 DEFICIT\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\n1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS\nAndrea Electronics Corporation, incorporated in the State of New York in 1934, (together with its subsidiaries, \u201cAndrea\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) has been engaged in the electronic communications industry since its inception. Since the early 1990s, Andrea has been primarily focused on developing and manufacturing state-of-the-art microphone technologies and products for enhancing speech-based applications software and communications, primarily in the computer and business enterprise markets that require high quality, clear voice signals. Andrea\u2019s technologies eliminate unwanted background noise to enable the optimum performance of various speech-based and audio applications. Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products have been designed for applications that are controlled by or depend on speech across a broad range of hardware and software platforms. These products incorporate Digital Signal Processing, Noise Cancellation, Active Noise Cancellation and Active Noise Reduction microphone technologies, and are designed to cancel background noise in a wide range of noisy environments, such as homes, offices, factories and automobiles. Andrea also manufactures a line of accessories for these products for the consumer and commercial markets in the United States as well as in Europe and Asia. Andrea\u2019s products and technologies are developed in part using its proprietary intellectual property. Andrea intends to vigorously defend and monetize its intellectual property through licensing arrangements and, where necessary, enforcement actions against those entities using our patented solutions in their products. Royalties resulting from these patent monetization efforts can be structured in a variety of ways, including but not limited to one-time paid up licenses or on-going royalty arrangements. Andrea records these activities as part of Andrea\u2019s Patent Monetization segment.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nLiquidity\nASC 205-40, \u201cPresentation of Financial statements-Going Concern,\u201d requires management to evaluate whether there are relevant conditions and events that, in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Based upon the evaluation, management believes the Company has the ability to meet its obligations as they become due within the next twelve months from the date of the financial statement issuance.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic which continues to spread throughout the United States. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders and other public health measures were implemented across much of the United States, including the Long Island area, where the Company is located.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The Company is continually monitoring the outbreak of COVID-19 and the related business and travel restrictions and changes to behavior intended to reduce its spread including the speed of the ongoing vaccine distribution effort, and its impact on operations, financial position, cash flows, inventory, supply chains, purchasing trends, customer payments, and the industry in general, in addition to the impact on its employees. Due to the rapid development and fluidity of this situation, the magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its impact on the Company's operations and liquidity is uncertain as of the date of this report. Although the Company has not yet had customers cancel any open orders, some customers have delayed shipments of products into future months, causing the Company\u2019s 2020 product revenues to be approximately $400,000 less than the same period in 2019. While there could ultimately be a material impact on future operations and liquidity of the Company, the full impact of COVID-19 cannot be determined.\nOn May 8, 2020, the Company entered into a certain U.S. Small Business Administration Note and Loan Agreement with HSBC Bank USA, N.A. pursuant to which the Company received loan proceeds of $142,775 (the \u201cPPP Loan First Draw\u201d). The PPP Loan First Draw was made under, and is subject to the terms and conditions of, the Payment Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) which was established under the CARES Act and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. See Note 7 for additional information on the PPP Loans. On January 18, 2021, the PPP Loan First Draw was forgiven by the SBA, barring an initial $8,000 advance. The Company expects the initial advance to also be forgiven.\nOn July 13, 2020, the Company entered into a U.S. Small Business Administration Loan Authorization and Agreement pursuant to which the Company received loan proceeds of $150,000 (the \u201cSBA Loan\u201d). The SBA Loan was made under, and is subject to the terms and conditions of, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program, which was a program expanded for COVID-19 relief under the CARES Act and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. The term of the SBA Loan is thirty (30) years with a maturity date of July 13, 2050 and the annual interest rate of the SBA Loan is a fixed rate of 3.75%. Under the terms of the CARES Act, the use of loan proceeds for the SBA Loan is limited to alleviating economic injury caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company used the proceeds of the SBA Loan for such purpose. See Note 7 for additional information on the SBA Loan.\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nOn February 5, 2021, the Company entered into a certain U.S. Small Business Administration Note and Loan Agreement with HSBC Bank USA, N.A. pursuant to which the Company received loan proceeds of $142,777 (the \u201cPPP Loan Second Draw\u201d and together with the PPP Loan First Draw, the \u201cPPP Loans\u201d). The PPP Loan Second Draw was made under, and is subject to the terms and conditions of, the PPP which was established under the CARES Act and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. See Note 7 for additional information on the PPP Loans.\nThe Company\u2019s loss before income taxes was approximately $823,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, of which $52,000 represents non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses. As part of its evaluation, management considered the Company\u2019s cash balance of $362,730 and working capital of $321,491 as of December 31, 2020 as well as the Company\u2019s projected revenues and expenses for the next twelve months. If the Company is not successful in achieving its projected revenues and expenses, it may need to seek other sources of revenue, areas of further expense reduction or additional funding from other sources such as debt or equity raising; however, there is no assurance that the Company would be successful in a debt or equity raise or that such funding would be on terms that it would find acceptable.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Andrea and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified in order to conform to current year presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on previously reported results of operation or loss per share.\nLoss Per Share\nBasic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss adjusts basic loss earnings per share for the effects of convertible securities, stock options and other potentially dilutive financial instruments, only in the periods in which such effect is dilutive. Diluted loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method for the outstanding options, and the if-converted method for the outstanding convertible instruments. Under the treasury stock method, options are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later) and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. Under the if-converted method, outstanding convertible instruments are assumed to be converted into common stock at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later).\nSecurities that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) in the future that were not included in the computation of the diluted EPS because to do so would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented, consist of the following:\nCash\nCash includes cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. At various times during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had cash deposits in excess of the maximum amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. The Company does not believe it is exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the financial institutions in which its deposits are held. At December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s cash was held at four financial institutions.\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nConcentration of Risk\nThe following customers accounted for 10% or more of Andrea\u2019s consolidated total revenues during at least one of the periods presented below:\n________________________\n* Amounts are less than 10%\nAs of December 31, 2020, Customers A, B and C accounted for approximately 32%, 14% and 17%, respectively, of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2019, Customers A, B and C accounted for approximately 39%, 17% and 31%, respectively, of accounts receivable.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company performs on-going credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer\u2019s current credit worthiness, as determined by the review of their current credit information. Collections and payments from customers are continuously monitored. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is based upon historical experience, as well as specific customer collection issues that have been identified. While such bad debt expenses have historically been within expectations and allowances established, the Company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has in the past. If the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. The cost of inventory is based on the respective cost of materials. Andrea reviews its inventory reserve for obsolescence on a quarterly basis and establishes reserves on inventories based on the specific identification method as well as a general reserve. Andrea records charges in inventory reserves as part of cost of revenues.\nProperty and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements.\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not materially prolong the normal useful life of an asset are charged to operations as incurred. Improvements that substantially extend the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. Upon sale or other disposition of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is reflected in the statement of operations.\nOther Intangible Assets\nAndrea amortizes its core technology and patents and trademarks on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives that range from 10 to 20 years.\nLong-Lived Assets\nAndrea accounts for its long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 360 \u201cPlant, Property and Equipment, \u201d for purposes of determining and measuring impairment of its long-lived assets (primarily intangible assets) other than goodwill. Andrea\u2019s policy is to review the value assigned to its long-lived assets to determine if they have been permanently impaired by adverse conditions which may affect Andrea whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If Andrea identifies a permanent impairment such that the carrying amount of Andrea\u2019s long-lived assets is not recoverable using the sum of an undiscounted cash flow projection (gross margin dollars from product sales), the impaired asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value, based on an estimate of future discounted cash flows which becomes the new cost basis for the impaired asset. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate undiscounted future operating cash flows and fair values and, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. No impairment charges were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (Topic 606) (\u201cASU No. 2014-09\u201d), which is described below in Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In accordance with Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue using the following five-step approach:\n1. Identify the contract with a customer.\n2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract.\n3. Determine the transaction price of the contract.\n4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\n5. Recognize revenue when the performance obligations are met or delivered.\nAndrea utilized the modified retrospective approach when reviewing its current accounting policies to identify potential differences that would result from applying the new requirements to its customer contracts. This approach includes the evaluation of sales terms, performance obligations, variable consideration, and costs to obtain and fulfill contracts. Based on the Company\u2019s review, management did not need to record a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of initial application and application of this guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company disaggregates its revenues into three contract types: (1) product revenues, (2) service related revenues and (3) license revenues and then further disaggregates its revenues by operating segment. Generally, product revenue is comprised of microphones and microphone connectivity product revenues. Product revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligation by transferring promised goods to a customer. Product revenue is measured at the transaction price, which is based on the amount of consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring the promised goods to the customer. Contracts with customers are comprised of customer purchase orders, invoices and written contracts. Customer product orders are fulfilled at a point in time and not over a period of time. The Company does not have arrangements for returns from customers and does not have any future obligations directly or indirectly related to product resale by customers. The Company has no sales incentive programs. Service related and licensing revenues are recognized based on the terms and conditions of individual contracts using the five step approach listed above, which identifies performance obligations and transaction price. Typically, Andrea receives licensing reports from its licensees approximately three months in arrears due to the fact that its agreements require customers to report revenues between 30-60 days after the end of the quarter. Under this accounting policy, the licensing revenues reported are not based upon estimates. In addition, service related revenues, which are short-term in nature, are generally performed on a time-and-material basis under separate service arrangements and the corresponding revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed. At December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any deferred revenue. See Note 14 for additional description of the Company\u2019s reportable business segments and the revenue reported in each segment.\nIncome Taxes\nAndrea accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d (\u201cASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and establishes for all entities a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of tax positions, and requires certain expanded disclosures. The provision for income taxes is based upon income or loss after adjustment for those permanent items that are not considered in the determination of taxable income. Deferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance. Andrea expects it will reduce its valuation allowance in future periods to the extent that it can demonstrate its ability to utilize the assets. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In management\u2019s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary. Income tax expense consists of taxes payable for the period, withholding of income tax as mandated by the foreign jurisdiction in which the revenues are earned and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has identified its federal tax return and its state tax return in New York as \"major\" tax jurisdictions. Based on the Company's evaluation, it has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company's evaluation was performed for tax years ended 2016 through 2020. The Company believes that its income tax positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to its financial position.\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nStock-Based Compensation\nAt December 31, 2020, Andrea had one stock-based employee compensation plan, which is described more fully in Note 13. Andrea accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, \u201cCompensation - Stock Compensation\u201d (\u201cASC 718\u201d). ASC 718 establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Under the provisions of ASC 718, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee\u2019s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock options are estimated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility, dividend rate, risk free interest rate and the expected life. The Company expenses stock-based compensation by using the straight-line method. In accordance with ASC 718, excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock-based awards are classified in cash flows from financing activities. The future realization of the reserved deferred tax assets related to these tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options will result in a credit to additional paid in capital if the related tax deduction reduces taxes payable. The Company has elected the \u201cwith and without approach\u201d regarding ordering of windfall tax benefits to determine whether the windfall tax benefit did reduce taxes payable in the current year. Under this approach, the windfall tax benefit would be recognized in additional paid-in-capital only if an incremental tax benefit is realized after considering all other benefits presently available.\nResearch and Development\nAndrea expenses all research and development costs as incurred.\nAdvertising Expenses\nAll media costs of newspaper and magazine advertisements as well as trade show costs are expensed as incurred. Total advertising and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $6,000 and $12,000, respectively and are included in general, administrative and selling expenses.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nASC 820 \u201cFair Value Measurement and Disclosures: (\u201cASC 820\u201d) defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), and expands disclosures about payments to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 applies to all assets and liabilities that are measured and reported on a fair value basis.\nThe Company will apply the provisions of ASC 820 to nonfinancial assets and liabilities. Andrea calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the book value of those financial instruments. When the book value approximates fair value, no additional disclosure is made. Andrea uses quoted market prices whenever available to calculate these fair values. When quoted market prices are not available, Andrea uses standard pricing models for various types of financial instruments which take into account the present value of estimated future cash flows. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of all financial instruments approximated fair value.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The most significant estimates, among other things, are used in accounting for allowances for bad debts, inventory valuation and obsolescence, product warranty, depreciation, deferred income taxes, expected realizable values for assets (primarily intangible assets), contingencies, revenue recognition as well as the recording and presentation of the Company\u2019s convertible preferred stock. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of any material revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period that they are determined to be necessary. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nSubsequent Events\nThe Company evaluates events that occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. Based upon the evaluation, other than what is disclosed, the Company did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.\n3. INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nIntangible assets, net, consisted of the following:\nThe changes in the carrying amount of intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nAndrea accounts for its long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 360 \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d for purposes of determining and measuring impairment of its long-lived assets (primarily intangible assets) other than goodwill. Andrea\u2019s policy is to periodically review the value assigned to its long-lived assets to determine if they have been permanently impaired by adverse conditions which may affect Andrea. If Andrea identifies a permanent impairment such that the carrying amount of Andrea\u2019s long-lived assets are not recoverable using the sum of an undiscounted cash flow projection (gross margin dollars from product revenues), a new cost basis for the impaired asset will be established. If required, an impairment charge is recorded based on an estimate of future discounted cash flows. This new cost basis will be net of any recorded impairment. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Andrea concluded that there were no long-lived assets that were required to be tested for recoverability.\nAmortization expense was $37,807 and $48,433 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Patents and trademarks, once issued are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 10 to 20 years. Assuming no changes in the Company's intangible assets, estimated amortization expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years ending December 31 is expected to be approximately $30,000, $28,000, $26,000, $26,000 and $26,000, respectively.\n4. INVENTORIES\nInventories consisted of the following:\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\n5. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nProperty and equipment, net, consisted of the following:\nDepreciation and amortization of property and equipment was $14,424 and $28,928 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n6. REVENUE SHARING, NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT\nRevenue Sharing and Note Purchase Agreement\nOn December 24, 2014, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Revenue Sharing and Note Purchase Agreement (the \u201cRevenue Sharing Agreement\u201d) with AND34 Funding LLC (\u201cAND34\u201d) (acting as the \u201cRevenue Participants,\u201d the \u201cNote Purchasers,\u201d and the \u201cCollateral Agent\u201d), which was retroactively effective as of February 14, 2014. Under the Revenue Sharing Agreement, the Company granted AND34 a perpetual predetermined share in the rights of the Company\u2019s specified future revenues from patents (\u201cMonetization Revenues\u201d) owned by the Company (the \u201cPatents\u201d) in exchange for $3,500,000, which was fully repaid as of September 30, 2016 and issued certain notes containing the features described in the Revenue Sharing Agreement (the \u201cNotes\u201d), which were also repaid in 2016. In 2016, 2017 and 2019, the parties executed and amended a rider to the Revenue Sharing Agreement (the \u201cRider\u201d) pursuant to which Andrea agreed to issue and sell to AND34 additional Notes up to an aggregate amount of $11,500,000 (the \u201cAdditional Notes\u201d), or such greater amount as AND34 may agree to in its sole discretion. The most recent rider executed in 2019 increased the aggregate principal amount from $7,500,000 to $11,500,000. The Additional Notes and related PIK interest have a maturity date of August 31, 2022. The proceeds of the Additional Notes will be used to pay certain expenses related to the Revenue Sharing Agreement and expenses of the Company incurred in pursuing patent monetization. As of December 31, 2019, there was $1,684,422 of Additional Notes principal and $143,087 PIK interest outstanding. As of December 31, 2020, there was $1,884,422 of Additional Notes principal and $209,545 PIK interest outstanding.\nAny Monetization Revenues will first be applied 100% to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on, and then to repay outstanding principal of, the Additional Notes. After the Additional Notes are paid in full, the Monetization Revenues will be allocated amongst the Revenue Participants and the Company in accordance with certain predetermined percentages (based on aggregate amounts received by the Revenue Participants) ranging from 50% to the Revenue Participants to ultimately 20%. Monetization Revenues is defined in the Revenue Sharing Agreement to include, but is not limited to, amounts that the Company receives from third parties with respect to the Patents, which may include new license revenues, certain product revenue, payments and judgments. Monetization Revenues and associated expenses are included in the Company\u2019s Patent Monetization Segment (See Note 14).\nThe Revenue Sharing Agreement contains many stipulations between the parties regarding the handling of various matters related to the monetization of the Patents including tax treatment. Following an Event of Default under the Revenue Sharing Agreement, the Note Purchasers and Revenue Participants may proceed to protect and enforce their rights by suit or other appropriate proceeding, either for specific performance or the exercise of any power granted under the Revenue Sharing Agreement or ancillary documents including the Additional Notes.\n7. LONG TERM DEBT\nOn May 8, 2020, the Company entered into the PPP Loan First Draw, a U.S. Small Business Administration Note and Loan Agreement with HSBC Bank USA, N.A. pursuant to which the Company received loan proceeds of $142,775. While applying for the PPP Loan First Draw, the U.S. Small Business Administration advanced $8,000 of loan proceeds to the Company on April 30, 2020. The PPP Loan First Draw was made under, and is subject to the terms and conditions of, the PPP which was established under the CARES Act and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. The term of the PPP Loan First Draw is two years with a maturity date of May 8, 2022 and contains a favorable fixed annual interest rate of 1.00%. Payments of principal and interest on the PPP Loan First Draw will be deferred until the SBA has reached a decision on the Company\u2019s loan forgiveness application. Principal and interest are payable monthly and may be prepaid by the Company at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. Under the terms of the CARES Act, recipients can apply for and receive forgiveness for all or a portion of loans granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds for certain permissible purposes as set forth in the PPP, including, but not limited to, payroll costs (as defined under the PPP) and mortgage interest, rent or utility costs (collectively, \u201cQualifying Expenses\u201d), and on the maintenance of employee and compensation levels during the eight-week period following the funding of the PPP Loan First Draw. The Company used the proceeds of the PPP Loan First Draw for Qualifying Expenses. The Company was granted loan forgiveness of the PPP Loan First Draw in January 2021, for all but the $8,000 that was initially advanced.\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nOn July 13, 2020, the Company entered into a U.S. Small Business Administration Loan Authorization and Agreement pursuant to which the Company received loan proceeds of $150,000 (the \u201cSBA Loan\u201d). The SBA Loan was made under, and is subject to the terms and conditions of, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program, which was a program expanded for COVID-19 relief under the CARES Act and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. The term of the SBA Loan is thirty (30) years with a maturity date of July 13, 2050 and the annual interest rate of the SBA Loan is a fixed rate of 3.75%. Under the terms of the CARES Act, the use of loan proceeds for the SBA Loan is limited to alleviating economic injury caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the SBA Loan for such purpose.\nThe unpaid principal amount of the Additional Notes (including any PIK interest) has an interest rate equal to LIBOR (as defined in the Revenue Sharing Agreement) plus 2% per annum, (totaling 3.00% and 4.10% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively); provided that upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default (as set forth in the Revenue Sharing Agreement), the interest rate will increase an additional 2% per annum. Interest may be paid in cash at the option of the Company or otherwise shall be paid by increasing the principal amount of the Additional Notes by the amount of such PIK interest. The Company may prepay the Additional Notes from time to time in whole or in part, without penalty or premium. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 $200,000 of Additional Notes were issued to AND34. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining amount of Additional Notes that can be issued is $3,700,000. Amounts reported as current maturities of long-term debt reflect amounts expected to be paid in the next twelve months.\nOn March 12, 2021 $100,000 of Additional Notes were issued to AND34.\nOn February 5, 2021, the Company entered into the PPP Loan Second Draw, a U.S. Small Business Administration Note and Loan Agreement with HSBC Bank USA, N.A. pursuant to which the Company received loan proceeds of $142,777. The PPP Loan Second Draw was made under, and is subject to the terms and conditions of, the PPP which was established under the CARES Act and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. Under the terms of the CARES Act, recipients can apply for and receive forgiveness for all or a portion of loans granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds for certain permissible purposes as set forth in the PPP, including, but not limited to, payroll costs (as defined under the PPP) and mortgage interest, rent or utility costs (collectively, \u201cQualifying Expenses\u201d), and on the maintenance of employee and compensation levels during the eight-week period following the funding of the PPP Loan Second Draw. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the PPP Loan Second Draw, for Qualifying Expenses. The Company intends to apply for loan forgiveness of the PPP Loan Second Draw, there is no assurance that the Company will be granted forgiveness of the PPP Loan Second Draw in whole or in part.\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\n8. TRADE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES\nTrade accounts payable and other current liabilities consisted of the following:\n9. SERIES C CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK\nOn October 10, 2000, Andrea issued and sold in a private placement $7,500,000 of Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries C Preferred Stock\u201d). Each of these shares of Series C Preferred Stock had a stated value of $10,000 plus a $1,671 increase in the stated value, which sum is convertible into Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.2551. On February 17, 2004, Andrea announced that it had entered into an Exchange and Termination Agreement and an Acknowledgment and Waiver Agreement, which eliminated the dividend of 5% per annum on the stated value. The additional amount of $1,671 represents the 5% per annum from October 10, 2000 through February 17, 2004. The shares of Series C Preferred Stock are subject to antidilution provisions, which are triggered in the event of certain stock splits, recapitalizations, or other dilutive transactions. In addition, issuances of common stock at a price below the conversion price then in effect (currently $0.2551), or the issuance of warrants, options, rights, or convertible securities which have an exercise price or conversion price less than that conversion price, other than for certain previously outstanding securities and certain \u201cexcluded securities\u201d (as defined in the certificate of amendment), require the adjustment of the conversion price to that lower price at which shares of common stock have been issued or may be acquired. In the event that Andrea issues securities in the future which have a conversion price or exercise price which varies with the market price and the terms of such variable price are more favorable than the conversion price in the Series C Preferred Stock, the purchasers may elect to substitute the more favorable variable price when making conversions of the Series C Preferred Stock.\nIn accordance with Sub Topic 815-40, Andrea evaluated the Series C Preferred Stock and concluded that it is not indexed to the Company\u2019s stock because of the conversion price adjustment feature described above. Accordingly, under the provisions of ASC 815, \u201cDerivatives and Hedging\u201d (\u201cASC 815\u201d), Andrea evaluated the Series C Preferred Stock embedded conversion feature. The Company has concluded that the embedded conversion feature would be classified in shareholders\u2019 equity if it were a freestanding instrument, but as the Series C Preferred Stock is more akin to equity and as such it should not be bifurcated from the Series C instrument and accounted for separately.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were 11.469249 shares of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding, which were convertible into 524,736 shares of Common Stock and had remaining accrued dividends of $19,168.\n10. SERIES D CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK\nOn February 17, 2004, Andrea entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (including a Registration Rights Agreement) with certain holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and other investors (collectively, the \u201cBuyers\u201d) pursuant to which the Buyers agreed to invest a total of $2,500,000. In connection with this agreement, on February 23, 2004, the Buyers purchased, for a purchase price of $1,250,000, an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of a new class of preferred stock, the Series D Preferred Stock, convertible into 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock (an effective conversion price of $0.25 per share) and Common Stock warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock. These warrants were exercisable at any time after August 17, 2004, at an exercise price of $0.38 per share. On February 23, 2009, these warrants expired without being exercised.\nIn addition, on June 4, 2004, the Buyers purchased for an additional $1,250,000, an additional 1,250,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock convertible into 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock (an effective conversion price of $0.25 per share) and Common Stock warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock. The warrants were exercisable at any time after December 4, 2004 and before June 4, 2009 at an exercise price of $0.17 per share. On June 4, 2009, these warrants expired without being exercised.\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nThe shares of Series D Preferred Stock are also subject to antidilution provisions, which are triggered in the event of certain stock splits, recapitalizations, or other dilutive transactions. In addition, issuances of common stock at a price below the conversion price then in effect (an effective conversion price of $0.25 per share), or the issuance of warrants, options, rights, or convertible securities which have an exercise price or conversion price less than that conversion price, other than for certain previously outstanding securities and certain \u201cexcluded securities\u201d (as defined in the certificate of amendment), require the adjustment of the conversion price to that lower price at which shares of common stock have been issued or may be acquired. In the event that Andrea issues securities in the future which have a conversion price or exercise price which varies with the market price and the terms of such variable price are more favorable than the conversion price in the Series D Preferred Stock, the purchasers may elect to substitute the more favorable variable price when making conversions of the Series D Preferred Stock. In addition, the Company is required to use its best efforts to secure the inclusion for quotation on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board for the common stock issuable under the Series D Preferred Stock and to arrange for at least two market makers to register with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. In the event that the holder of the Series D Preferred Stock is unable to convert these securities into Andrea Common Stock, the Company shall pay to each such holder a Registration Delay Payment. This payment is to be paid in cash and is equal to the product of (i) the stated value of such Preferred Shares multiplied by (ii) the product of (1) .0005 multiplied by (2) the number of days that sales cannot be made pursuant to the Registration Statement (excluding any days during that period that may be considered grace periods as defined by the Registration Rights Agreement).\nIn accordance with Sub Topic 815-40, Andrea evaluated the Series D Preferred Stock and concluded that it is not considered to be indexed to the Company\u2019s stock because of the conversion price adjustment feature described above. Accordingly, under the provisions of ASC 815, Andrea evaluated the Series D Preferred Stock embedded conversion feature. The Company has concluded that the embedded conversion feature would be classified in shareholders\u2019 equity if it were a freestanding instrument, but as the Series D Preferred Stock is more akin to equity and as such it should not be bifurcated from the Series D instrument and accounted for separately.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were 907,144 shares of Series D Preferred Stock outstanding which were convertible into 3,628,576 shares of Common Stock.\n11. INCOME TAXES\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law. The CARES Act includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to the tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The CARES Act has an immaterial impact on the Company\u2019s income taxes.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of January 1, 2019 and during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe Company has identified its federal tax return and its state tax return in New York as \u201cmajor\u201d tax jurisdictions, as defined in ASC 740. Based on the Company's evaluation, it has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company's evaluation was performed for tax years ended 2017 through 2020. The Company believes that its income tax positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to its consolidated financial position.\nThe Company's policy for recording interest and penalties associated with audits is to record such items as a component of income tax expense. There were no amounts accrued for penalties or interest as of or during the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company determined that, more likely than not, its deferred tax assets would not be realized and, accordingly, decreased the valuation allowance. The increase in the valuation allowance is included in the income tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. Management is currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviations from its position.\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nThe provision for income tax consisted of the following:\nThe provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 of approximately $600 and $1,800, respectively, is the result of certain licensing revenues that are subject to withholding of income tax as mandated by the foreign jurisdiction in which the revenues are earned partially offset by a Federal income tax refund relating to alternative minimum tax credits.\nLoss before income taxes is comprised of the following:\nA reconciliation between the effective rate for income taxes and the amount computed by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to loss before provision for income taxes is as follows:\nThe components of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax asset, net, are as follows:\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nThe change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets are summarized as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020, Andrea federal had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $27,000,000. $2,400,000 of these federal net operating loss carryforwards are carried forward indefinitely, the remaining $24,600,000 expire in varying amounts beginning in 2021 through 2036. Andrea has state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $3,700,000 expiring in varying amounts beginning in 2035. Andrea has general business credits of approximately $1,000,000 expiring in varying amounts beginning in 2021 through 2039. The Company records tax benefits and expense in the statements of earnings.\n12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLeases\nEffective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted a new lease accounting standard using the modified retrospective method of applying the new standard at the adoption date. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard. This allowed us to carry forward the historical lease classification. Adoption of this standard resulted in the recording of net operating lease right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and corresponding operating lease liabilities of $77,547, with no material cumulative effect adjustment to equity as of the date of adoption. The financial position for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 are presented under the new guidance, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with previous guidance.\nOur operating lease portfolio includes corporate offices, information technology (IT) equipment, and automobiles with remaining lease terms of 1 year to 2 years. Operating lease ROU assets are presented within other assets. The current portion of operating lease liabilities are presented within trade accounts payable and other current liabilities, and the non-current portion of operating lease liabilities are presented separately on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\nOperating Leases\nAs of December 31, 2020, maturities of operating lease liabilities were as follows:\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nEmployment Agreements\nIn August 2014, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Andrea, which was subsequently amended several times, most recently on January 31, 2021. The effective date of the original employment agreement was August 1, 2014 and it currently expires on July 31, 2021, subject to renewal as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Pursuant to his amended employment agreement, Mr. Andrea will receive an annual base salary of $216,000. The employment agreement provides for quarterly bonuses equal to 5% of the Company\u2019s pre-bonus net after tax quarterly earnings for a total quarterly bonus amount not to exceed $12,500; and annual bonuses equal to 9% of the Company\u2019s annual pre-bonus net after tax earnings in excess of $300,000 up to $3,000,000, and 3% of the Company\u2019s annual pre-bonus adjusted net after tax earnings in excess of $3,000,000. Adjustments to net after tax earnings shall be made to remove the impact of change in recognition of accumulated deferred tax asset value and any income recognized from forgiveness of debt relating to the CARES Act. All bonuses shall be payable as soon as the Company\u2019s cash flow permits. All bonus determinations or any additional bonus in excess of the above will be made in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee. Under certain circumstances, Mr. Andrea is entitled to a change in control payment equal to twelve months of Mr. Andrea\u2019s most recent base salary plus a pro-rated portion of Mr. Andrea's most recent annual and four quarterly bonuses paid immediately preceding the change of control, continuation of health and medical benefits for twelve months and immediate vesting of all stock options in the event of a change in control during the term of his agreement and subsequent termination of his employment within twelve months following the change of control. In the event of his termination without cause or resignation with the Company\u2019s consent, Mr. Andrea is entitled to a severance payment equal to two months of his base salary, plus the two months pro-rated portion of his most recent annual and quarterly bonuses, payment of $12,500 (the un-paid bonus for the quarter ended September 30, 2017) and a continuation of health insurance coverage for Mr. Andrea and his dependents for 6 months. At December 31, 2020, the future minimum cash commitments under this agreement aggregate $126,000.\nOn November 11, 2008, the Company entered into an amended and restated change in control agreement with Corisa L. Guiffre, Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Corporate Secretary of the Company. The change in control agreement provides Ms. Guiffre with a severance benefit upon termination in connection with a change in control (as defined in the agreement). If Ms. Guiffre is terminated following a change in control, the Company will pay Ms. Guiffre a sum equal to three times Ms. Guiffre\u2019s average annual compensation for the five preceding taxable years. All restrictions on any restricted stock will lapse immediately and incentive stock options and stock appreciation rights, if any, will become immediately exercisable in the event of a change in control of the Company. Upon the occurrence of a change in control followed by Ms. Guiffre\u2019s termination of employment, the Company will continue life, medical, dental and disability coverage for 36 full calendar months following the date of termination.\nLegal Proceedings\nIn September 2016, the Company filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleging patent infringement against Apple Inc. (\u201cApple\u201d) and requesting monetary and injunctive relief (the \u201cNew York Litigation\u201d). The New York Litigation was stayed pending final disposition of a parallel case that the Company filed against Apple with the United States International Trade Commission (\u201cITC\u201d). The ITC\u2019s final decision finding that Apple did not violate the ITC\u2019s statute was issued on March 22, 2018. Apple informed the New York judge of this final decision on May 30, 2018. The ITC\u2019s final decision does not affect Andrea\u2019s right to continue prosecuting the New York litigation.\nIn January 2017, Apple filed four (4) petitions for inter partes review (\u201cIPR\u201d) of the Company\u2019s patents asserted in the New York Litigation with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d). The Company filed its Patent Owner\u2019s Preliminary Response in two of these IPR proceedings on May 1, 2017. The PTO instituted the four IPR proceedings requested by Apple on July 24, 2017. The Company filed its Patent Owner\u2019s Response in two of these IPR proceedings on November 7, 2017. Oral argument in these two IPR proceedings, occurred on April 25, 2018. On July 12, 2018, the PTO issued its final written decisions in those two IPR proceedings, ruling that claims 6-9 of the Company\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 6,363,345 remain valid and enforceable after the PTO\u2019s review. On September 13, 2018, Apple filed its Notice of Appeal of that ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the \u201cFederal Circuit\u201d). Apple filed its Appeal Brief with the Federal Circuit on January 31, 2019. The Company filed its Response to Apple\u2019s Appeal Brief on March 12, 2019. The Federal Circuit held an oral argument on October 1, 2019. On February 7, 2020, the Federal Circuit issued its decisions on Apple\u2019s appeals. The Federal Circuit affirmed the PTO\u2019s findings in one of the ongoing IPRs. In the other ongoing IPR, the Federal Circuit partly affirmed the PTO\u2019s findings, but also partly vacated the PTO\u2019s findings, and remanded the case back to the PTO for further proceedings. On remand of the ongoing IPR, on October 28, 2020, the PTO found that claims 6-9 of the Company\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 6,363,345 are invalid. The Company has appealed this decision to the Federal Circuit.\nThe New York Litigation is stayed pending the final outcome of Apple\u2019s IPR proceedings against the Company\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 6,363,345.\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nAndrea intends to vigorously prosecute the New York Litigation and the ongoing IPR proceedings.\n13. STOCK PLANS AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nIn August 2019, the Board adopted the Andrea Electronics Corporation 2019 Equity Compensation Plan (\u201c2019 Plan\u201d), which was subsequently approved by the shareholders on October 24, 2019. The 2019 Plan authorizes the granting of awards, the exercise of which would allow up to an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of Andrea\u2019s common stock to be acquired by the holders of those awards. Awards can be granted to key employees, officers, directors and consultants. No awards have been granted under the 2019 Plan.\nIn October 2006, the Board adopted the Andrea Electronics Corporation 2006 Equity Compensation Plan (\u201c2006 Plan\u201d), which was subsequently approved by the shareholders. The 2006 Plan, as amended, authorized the granting of awards, the exercise of which would allow up to an aggregate of 18,000,000 shares of Andrea\u2019s Common Stock to be acquired by the holders of those awards. Awards could be granted to key employees, officers, directors and consultants. As the 2006 Plan has expired, no further awards will be granted under the 2006 Plan.\nThe stock option awards granted under the 2006 Plan have been granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company\u2019s stock at the date of grant with vesting periods of up to four years and 10-year contractual terms. The fair values of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the weighted-average assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from historical volatility of the Company\u2019s stock. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nNo options were granted during the year ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nOption activity during 2020 is summarized as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, no options vested, nor were any options exercised or forfeited. Based on the December 31, 2020 fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock of $0.04 per share, there is no aggregate intrinsic value for the 6,301,500 options outstanding and exercisable.\nThere was no compensation expense recognized related to stock option awards for the year ended December 31, 2020. Total compensation expense recognized related to stock option awards was $17,710 for the year ended December 31, 2019. In the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019, $15,659 of expense is included in general, administrative and selling expenses and $2,051 is included in research and development expenses. As of December 31, 2020, there is no unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements.\n14. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nAndrea follows the provisions of ASC 280 \u201cSegment Reporting\u201d (\u201cASC 280\u201d). Reportable operating segments are determined based on Andrea\u2019s management approach. The management approach, as defined by ASC 280, is based on the way that the chief operating decision-maker organizes the segments within an enterprise for making operating decisions and assessing performance. While Andrea\u2019s results of operations are primarily reviewed on a consolidated basis, the chief operating decision-maker manages the enterprise in two segments: (i) Patent Monetization; and (ii) Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products. Patent Monetization includes Monetization Revenues (as defined in our Revenue Sharing Agreement). Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products primarily include products based on the use of some, or all, of the following technologies: Andrea Digital Super Directional Array microphone technology (\u201cDSDA\u201d), Andrea Direction Finding and Tracking Array microphone technology (\u201cDFTA\u201d), Andrea PureAudio noise filtering technology, and Andrea EchoStop, an advanced acoustic echo cancellation technology.\nANDREA ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020\nThe following represents selected consolidated financial information for Andrea\u2019s segments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nManagement of Andrea assesses assets and non-operating income statement data on a consolidated basis only. International revenues are based on the country in which the end-user is located.
