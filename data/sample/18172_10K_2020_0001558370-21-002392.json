    "item_1": "ITEM 1 - Business\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, \u201cthe Company,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour\u201d refer to A. M. Castle & Co., a Maryland corporation, and its subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements, except as otherwise indicated or as the context otherwise requires.\nCompany Overview\nA.M. Castle & Co. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a global distributor of specialty metals and supply chain services, principally serving the producer durable equipment, commercial and military aircraft, heavy equipment, industrial goods, and construction equipment sectors of the global economy. Its customer base includes many Fortune 500 companies as well as thousands of medium- and smaller-sized firms spread across a variety of industries. Particular focus is placed on the aerospace and defense, power generation, mining, heavy industrial equipment, and general manufacturing industries, as well as general engineering applications.\nThe Company\u2019s corporate headquarters is located in Oak Brook, Illinois. As of December 31, 2020, the Company operates out of 21 service centers located throughout North America (16), Europe (2) and Asia (3). The Company\u2019s service centers hold inventory and process and distribute products to both local and export markets.\nIndustry and Markets\nService centers operate as supply chain intermediaries between primary producers, which deal in bulk quantities in order to achieve economies of scale, and end-users in a variety of industries that require specialized products in significantly smaller quantities and forms. Service centers also manage the differences in lead times that exist in the supply chain. While original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEM\u201d) and other customers often demand delivery within hours, the lead time required by primary producers can range from several months to over a year for certain specialty metals. Service centers provide value to customers by aggregating purchasing, providing warehousing and distribution services to meet specific customer needs, including demanding delivery times and precise metal specifications, and by providing value-added metals processing services.\nThe principal markets served by the Company are highly competitive. The Company is focused on two key global end markets, aerospace and industrial. Competition within these markets is based on service, quality, processing capabilities, inventory availability, timely delivery, ability to provide supply chain solutions, and price. The Company competes in a highly fragmented industry. Competition in the various markets in which the Company participates comes from a large number of value-added metals processors and service centers on a local, regional, and global basis, some of which have greater financial resources, and some of which have more established brand names in certain local, regional, and global markets served by the Company.\nThe Company also competes to a lesser extent with primary metals producers who typically sell to larger customers requiring shipments of large volumes of metal with limited or no value-added processing.\nIn order to capture scale efficiencies and remain competitive, many primary metal producers are consolidating their operations and focusing on their core production activities. These producers have increasingly outsourced metals distribution, inventory management, and value-added metals processing services to metals service centers. This process of outsourcing allows the primary metal producers to work with a relatively small number of intermediaries rather than many end customers. As a result, metals service centers, including the Company, are now providing an expanding range of services for their customers, including metal purchasing, processing, and supply chain solutions.\nThe Company\u2019s marketing strategy focuses on distributing highly-engineered specialty grades and alloys of metals as well as providing specialized processing services designed to meet very precise specifications. Core products include alloy and stainless steels, nickel alloys, aluminum, titanium, and carbon. Inventories of these products may assume many forms such as plate, sheet, extrusions, round bar, hexagonal bar, square and flat bar, tubing, and coil. Depending on the size of the facility and the nature of the markets it serves, the Company\u2019s service centers are equipped as needed with bar saws, plate saws, oxygen and plasma arc flame cutting machinery, trepanning machinery, boring machinery, honing equipment, water-jet cutting equipment, stress relieving and annealing furnaces, leveling and surface grinding equipment, CNC machinery, and sheet shearing equipment. Various specialized fabrications are also performed for customers internally or through pre-qualified subcontractors that thermally process, turn, polish, cut-to-length, and straighten alloy and carbon bar, among other things.\nProcurement\nThe Company purchases metals from many producers. Material is purchased in large lots and stocked at its service centers until sold, usually in smaller quantities and typically with some value-added processing services performed. The Company\u2019s ability to provide timely delivery of a wide variety of specialty metals products, along with its processing capabilities and supply chain management solutions, allows customers to lower their own inventory investment by reducing their need to order the large quantities required by producers and their need to perform additional material processing services. Some of the Company\u2019s purchases are covered by long-term contracts and commitments, which generally have corresponding customer sales agreements.\nThousands of customers from a wide array of industries are serviced primarily through the Company\u2019s own sales organization. Orders are primarily filled with materials shipped from Company stock. The materials required to fill the balance of sales are obtained from other sources, such as purchases from other distributors or direct mill shipments to customers. Deliveries are made principally by third party logistics providers using their fleets, some of which display Company-branding. Otherwise, common carrier delivery is used in areas not serviced directly by such third party logistics providers. The Company\u2019s broad network of locations provides same or next-day delivery to most of their markets, and two-day delivery to substantially all of the remaining target markets.\nCustomers\nThe Company\u2019s customer base is broadly diversified and therefore, the Company does not have dependence upon any single customer, or a few customers. The customer base includes many Fortune 500 companies as well as thousands of medium- and smaller-sized firms.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had 681 full-time employees. Of these full-time employees, 80 were represented by the United Steelworkers of America (\u201cUSW\u201d) under collective bargaining agreements. Effective May 15, 2018, we entered into a four-year collective bargaining agreement with the USW, which covers approximately 59 employees at our largest facility in Cleveland, Ohio. Approximately 21 employees at our Hammond, Indiana facility are covered by a separate collective bargaining agreement with the USW that was renegotiated effective September 1, 2020, and expires on March 31, 2024. The Company believes its relationships with its employees and their representative unions are good.\nAccess to SEC Filings\nThe Company makes available free of charge on or through its Web site at www.castlemetals.com the Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). Information on our Web site does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe following selected information for each of our current executive officers (as defined by regulations of the SEC) was prepared as of March 4, 2021.",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - Risk Factors\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within our control, that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Any of the following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCapital Resources\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt instruments.\nWe have substantial debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2020, we had $238.7 million of total debt outstanding, all of which is secured. The debt outstanding, in order of priority, was comprised of $115.6 million of borrowings under our Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (as amended, the \u201cABL Credit Agreement\u201d), $98.8 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% / 5.00% Convertible Senior Secured Paid In Kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) Toggle Notes due 2024 (the \u201c3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes\u201d), including $0.1 million of restricted 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes issued to certain members of management (\u201cMIP Notes\u201d), $4.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% / 7.00% Convertible Senior Secured Paid In Kind (PIK) Toggle Notes due 2022 (the \u201c5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes\u201d, and together with the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes, the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d), and short-term borrowings of approximately $3.0 million under a local credit facilities (see Note 2 - Debt). We also have a Paycheck Protection Program Term Note due April 28, 2022, in the amount of $10.0 million (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d) and our French subsidiary\u2019s term loan in the amount of $7.4 million (the \u201cFrance Term Loan\u201d). Our debt instruments currently limit our ability to pay in cash the interest accruing on our Convertible Notes, so the amount of Convertible Notes outstanding continues to increase quarterly as interest is paid in kind. The ABL Credit Agreement and the Convertible Notes are secured by collateral security interests in substantially all of our assets and are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could have significant effects on our business, including the following:\n\u25cf it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, or general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n\u25cf we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our indebtedness, which will reduce the funds available to use for operations and other purposes, including potentially accretive acquisitions;\n\u25cf our ability to fund a change of control offer under our debt instruments may be limited;\n\u25cf our substantial level of indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt or could affect our ability to secure favorable contracts with certain customers or suppliers;\n\u25cf our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited; and\n\u25cf our substantial level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nThe ABL Credit Agreement provides for $125.0 million senior secured, revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving A Credit Facility\u201d) as well as a subordinated $25.0 million Revolving B (Priority) senior secured, revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving B (Priority) Credit Facility\u201d), and a subordinated $21.5 million Revolving B senior secured, revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving B Credit Facility\u201d and together with the Revolving A Credit Facility and the Revolving B (Priority) Credit Facility, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). We expect to obtain the funds to pay our expenses and to satisfy our debt obligations from our operations and available resources under the Credit Facilities. Our ability to meet our expenses and make these principal and interest payments as they come due, therefore, depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, and our anticipated revenue and cash flow may not be realized, either or both of which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not have enough funds, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt, sell assets or borrow more funds, which we may not be able to accomplish on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our existing debt service obligations, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreements, which may not be successful.\nOur total debt under our ABL Credit Agreement, the Convertible Notes, including MIP Notes, the PPP Loan, our France Term Loan and our local credit facilities have an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $238.7 million as of December 31, 2020. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our future financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Therefore, we may not be able to maintain or realize a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments, capital expenditures or potentially accretive acquisitions, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous borrowing covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.\nOur debt instruments impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and taking certain actions and our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt instruments could result in an event of default that could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur debt agreements impose, and future debt agreements may impose, operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u25cf incur additional indebtedness, or issue disqualified capital stock;\n\u25cf pay dividends, redeem subordinated debt or make other restricted payments;\n\u25cf make certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u25cf grant or permit certain liens on our assets;\n\u25cf enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf merge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of our assets;\n\u25cf create or permit restrictions on dividends, loans, asset transfers or other distributions to us from certain of our subsidiaries;\n\u25cf transfer, sell or acquire assets; and\n\u25cf change the business we conduct.\nThese covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, engage in or expand business activities, including future opportunities that may be in our interest, and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, in certain circumstances, the relevant lenders or holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our debt obligations and may not be able to continue our operations as planned.\nCOVID-19\nOur business and operations, and the operations of our suppliers and customers, have been, and for an indefinite period of time may continue to be, adversely affected by the novel coronavirus (or COVID-19) pandemic, and could be impacted in the future by other pandemics, known or unknown.\nWe may face risks related to the ongoing outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was declared a \u201cpandemic\u201d by the World Health Organization and a national public health emergency by governments throughout the world as the disease spread across the globe and continues to substantially and materially impact worldwide economic activity. The continuing impact of COVID-19 and the associated pandemic is unknown and continues to evolve. Health epidemics or outbreaks of communicable diseases such as COVID-19 could result in widespread or localized health crises that could adversely affect general commercial activity and the economies and financial markets of many countries or localities in which the Company operates, sells, or purchases good and services. A public health epidemic, including COVID-19, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, transportation providers, and other business partners may from time to time be prevented or impaired from conducting ordinary course business activities for indefinite periods of time, either at specific branches or on a broader scale, including due to shutdowns necessitated for the health and well-being of our employees, the employees of our business partners, or shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. Directives to \u201cde-densify\u201d worksites, \u201cShelter in Place,\u201d \u201cSafe at Home,\u201d quarantine, or similar orders or mandates that restrict workforce and/or require closures of \u201cnon-essential\u201d businesses have been implemented by government authorities to one degree or another starting with China in January 2020 and quickly spreading in the following months through Europe, North America and most locations throughout the world. Such orders or mandates have been lifted in many geographies, but there is a continuing threat that such measures may again be required as the original COVID-19 virus, or variants thereof, have continued to spread in certain geographies. While vaccines are now available and being administered in certain geographies, the quantities are limited and are generally reserved at this time for healthcare workers, first responders, long-term care facility staff and residents, people 65 years or older, other individuals with significant health concerns, and essential workers. Although the Company has already been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the situation is very fluid and subject to rapid change; the full extent of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may yet have on\nthe Company's business, operations and financial condition is currently unknown. Future pandemics could have similar, or more severe, impacts to our business and operations.\nWhile our branches have as a whole generally remained operational at varying levels of volume throughout the pandemic, there can be no assurances that from time to time we will not have to close any branch or multiple branches for indefinite periods of time due to concerns over the health and well-being of our employees, due to further developments in government directives or due to continued drop in demand from our customers or disruptions from our suppliers. While we have implemented policies and practices to protect our employees at each of our locations, including sanitizing and cleaning protocols, requiring face coverings and other personal protective equipment, social distancing and other behavioral best practices, remote work arrangements, staggered and spaced work shifts, separating workspaces by distance and/or physical barriers, and suspending non-essential employee travel and visitors to our locations throughout the world, there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful to prevent a contamination from impacting or potentially closing any of our branches or corporate offices for a time. While each of our operations has prepared and regularly updates customized business continuity and return to work plans to address COVID-19 concerns, in an effort to ensure that we are protecting our employees, continuing to operate our business and service our customers\u2019 needs, and mitigating the potential impacts of COVID-19 or other similar epidemics, there is no guarantee that such plans will anticipate or fully mitigate the various impacts the pandemic, much of which is still entirely uncertain. While vaccines are expected to be more widely available in the coming months, there can be no assurances as to how quickly the vaccines will be made available in sufficient quantities to mitigate the continuing economic effects of the pandemic and there can be no assurances that the vaccines will eradicate COVID-19 and any variants. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the scope and severity of the impact that COVID-19 could yet have on our branches, the continued spread of COVID-19 (including any variants), the measures taken by the governments of countries affected, the availability and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccinations, actions taken to protect employees, actions taken to continue operations, and the impact of the pandemic on various business activities in affected countries could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn April 2020, we applied for and received a $10.0 million PPP Loan (see Item 8 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic). At that time, after taking into account, among other things, the disruptions to our business activities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our completed exchange offer to issue our 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes and shares of our common stock in exchange for our 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes, our available, committed primary sources of liquidity, and our lack of access to alternative sources of liquidity, we believed and certified that economic conditions at that time made this loan request necessary and appropriate to support our ongoing U.S. operations and mitigate potentially significant detriment to our business. Recipients of loans in excess of $2.0 million will be audited and, despite our good-faith belief that given our circumstances we then satisfied and continue to satisfy all eligible requirements for the PPP Loan as well as all conditions for loan forgiveness. The federal government may disagree and determine that we were ineligible to have applied for and received the PPP Loan and/or ineligible for loan forgiveness either in full and/or in part. In such event, we may be required to repay the PPP Loan in its entirety and could be subject to additional penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nWhile we have and continue to pursue government relief programs in addition to the PPP loan and the France Term Loan (including tax deferrals, subsidies, loans, etc.) and have and continue to implement a number of temporary and long-term cost-cutting initiatives to align our operations to current customer demand as well as be prepared for any market recovery once this pandemic has passed, including staff reductions, reduction in employee hours and/or salaries, furloughs, temporary layoffs, or a combination of these actions. At each of our locations, there can be no assurances that such actions will be sufficient to stave off the economic impacts of the pandemic or that further such actions will not be warranted. Although we have seen recent improvements, we saw a significant reduction in customer forecasts and orders in 2020 as a result of the pandemic and there can be no assurances that we will not see further degradation in customer business in the short- or long-term and it is uncertain how quickly customer forecasts and business will improve following this pandemic.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and proceeds from borrowings under the Credit Facilities. Starting in the second quarter of 2020, and continuing into the second half of 2020, the average receivable days outstanding increased from levels in previous quarters, which we believe reflects some slowing in payments from customers due to the financial uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We also have a lower accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2020 (as compared to previous years) as a result of the decrease in demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has decreased our borrowing base collateral attributable to accounts receivable under our Credit Facilities and, in the near term, could result in less cash provided by operations. Further decreases in our accounts receivable could result in further reductions in our borrowing base collateral and therefore, the maximum amount we could borrow under our Credit Facilities could decrease accordingly. The decrease in demand has also resulted in an increase in inventory and average days sales in inventory in 2021 compared to previous years. We are focused on maintaining liquidity by purchasing a sufficient level of inventory to meet customer demand while not carrying excess inventory and lowering overall stock levels throughout the business. However, if we are unable to sufficiently manage our inventory levels and we begin to carry excess inventory, our liquidity could be unfavorably impacted. Conversely, a decrease in our inventory could result in a reduction in our borrowing base collateral attributable to inventory and therefore, the maximum amount we could borrow under our revolving credit facility could decrease accordingly.\nThe full extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business both in the short-term and long-term will depend on the continuing severity, location and duration of the spread of COVID-19 (and any variants) as well as resurgent outbreaks of COVID-19 which could result as communities reopen, the short- and long-term efficacy of the vaccines, and the speed at which vaccinations are available and administered. The extent of the impact will further depend on, among other things, the rate, pace, and effectiveness of the actions undertaken by local and world governments and health officials to contain the virus or treat its effects, the nature of government public health guidelines and the public\u2019s adherence to those guidelines, the impact of government economic relief on the US economy, unemployment levels, the success of businesses reopening, the timing for proven treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, consumer confidence and the rate, pace and effectiveness of the actions undertaken by the leadership and employees of our Company, as well as those of our suppliers, customers and other business partners, to return businesses to pre-pandemic levels.\nCapitalization\nOur public reporting obligations have been suspended, which could have an adverse impact on the market price and liquidity of our common stock and we filed documents with the SEC to terminate registration of our common stock with the SEC.\nEffective as of December 29, 2020, we effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split (the \u201cReverse Split\u201d), combining each 10 shares of our common stock into one whole share of common stock and paying cash in lieu of any fractional shares that otherwise would have resulted from the Reverse Split. As the Reverse Split resulted in a reduction in the number of stockholders of record to fewer than 300, on January 6, 2021 we filed with the SEC a Certification and Notice of Termination of Registration Under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on Form 15, deregistering our common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result of this \u201cgoing private\u201d transaction, our obligation to file periodic reports and other information with the SEC, including our quarterly and annual reports, has been suspended.\nPrior to the Reverse Split and the \u201cgoing private\u201d transaction, our common stock was traded on the OTCQX\u00ae Best Market (the \u201cOTCQX\u201d) under the ticker \u201cCTAM.\u201d It is anticipated that the trading of our common stock will shift to the OTC Pink Open Market, a centralized electronic quotation service for over-the-counter securities. OTC Pink is the baseline tier of the OTC Markets and has no financial standards or reporting requirements, and companies in this tier choose the level of information they provide to investors and may have current, limited, or no public disclosure. However, OTC Pink is not a stock exchange, and we do not have the ability to control whether our shares are quoted on OTC Pink. Trading opportunities in OTC Pink will be dependent upon whether any broker-dealers commit to continue making a market for our common stock. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that our common stock will continue to be quoted on OTC Pink. In addition, any prices at which our\nshares are quoted on the OTC Pink, if at all, may be more or less than the price of our common stock prior to deregistration. In addition, the spread between the bid and asked prices of our common stock on the OTC Pink may be wider than before deregistration and the liquidity of our shares may be lower. There can be no assurances that there will be any OTC Pink quotations for our common stock or that, if such quotations continue, they will continue for any length of time. There can be no assurances that any trading market for our common stock, at the OTC or otherwise, will continue.\nEven if trading on the OTC Pink continues, the trading of our common stock in the OTC market rather than a national securities exchange may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders. Securities traded in the OTC market generally have less liquidity due to factors such as the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in the securities, the reduced number of market makers in the securities, and the reduced number of securities analysts that follow such securities. As a result, holders of shares of our common stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all.\nAfter the deregistration of our common stock and suspension of our duty to file periodic reports and other information with the SEC, information regarding the Company (including our financial results) that has previously been available to the general public and our stockholders will no longer be readily available (subject in all respects to a continuing stockholder\u2019s right, if any, to certain information regarding the Company under Maryland law). The lack of publicly available information about the Company could result in a reduction of our profile with key stakeholders such as lenders, vendors, customers, investors, and employees. The limited or absences of any trading market, and the limited or absence of public information about our operations and results of operations, may result in a decline in the price of our common stock and may result in reduced liquidity for our common stock.\nFurthermore, because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock that could occur, the share price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the markets perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors, or parties with whom we have business relationships.\nThe lack of liquidity in our common stock may also make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future.\nOwnership of our stock is concentrated, which may limit stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nThe Company\u2019s ownership is concentrated among a small group of institutional investors and the Company\u2019s management team. Certain directors, their affiliates, and/or any other concentrated ownership interests may have the voting power to substantially affect or control the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate matters. Such a concentration of control could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or prevent a change in control or other business combinations that might be beneficial to us.\nThe lender under our Credit Facilities and/or the holders of our Convertible Notes can require us to repay our debt obligations following a change of control. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy such cash obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $115.5 million of borrowings under our Credit Facilities and $102.7 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Convertible Notes, including $0.1 million of MIP Notes. Upon the occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) or a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture for the Convertible Notes), which in either case includes the acquisition of more than 50% of our outstanding voting power by a person or group, we may be required to repay all borrowings under the Credit Facilities and/or repurchase some or all of the Convertible Notes for cash at a repurchase\nprice equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy such cash obligations and, in such circumstances, may not be able to arrange the necessary financing on favorable terms or at all. In addition, our ability to satisfy such cash obligations will be restricted pursuant to covenants contained in the indenture for the Convertible Notes and will be permitted to be paid only in limited circumstances. We may also be limited in our ability to satisfy such cash obligations by applicable law or the terms of other instruments governing our indebtedness. Our inability to make any cash payments that may be required to satisfy the obligations described above would trigger an event of default under the Convertible, which in turn could constitute an event of default under our other outstanding indebtedness, thereby potentially resulting in the acceleration of certain of such indebtedness, the prepayment of which could further restrict our ability to satisfy such cash obligations.\nHolders of our Convertible Notes may convert their Convertible Notes into common stock at any time or in connection with a fundamental change. The conversion of our Convertible Notes into common stock will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders.\nPursuant to the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture, we may elect to settle any election to convert Convertible Notes in cash, common stock or a combination of both, however, our debt instruments currently limit our ability to pay cash in respect of the Convertible Notes. Any issuance by us of our common stock upon conversion of our Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders. In addition, any such issuance of common stock could have a dilutive effect on our net income per share to the extent that the average stock price during the period is greater than the conversion prices and exercise prices of the Convertible Notes. Furthermore, any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nWe have various mechanisms in place that may prevent a change in control that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable.\nWe are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the \u201cMGCL\u201d) that prohibit us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person first becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d unless the business combination or stockholder interest is approved in a prescribed manner. The application of these and certain other provisions of our charter or the MGCL could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe provisions of our debt instruments also contain limitations on our ability to enter into change of control transactions. In addition, the repurchase rights in our Convertible Notes triggered by the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture for the Convertible Notes), and the additional shares of our common stock by which the conversion rate is increased in connection with certain fundamental change transactions, as described in the indenture for the Convertible Notes, could discourage a potential acquirer.\nOur Business\nOur future operating results are impacted by the volatility of the prices and supply of metals, which could cause our results to be adversely affected.\nThe availability and prices we pay for metal raw materials and the prices we charge for products may fluctuate depending on many factors, including general economic conditions (both domestic and international), competition, production levels, import tariffs, duties, and other trade restrictions, new or ongoing health and safety issues, and currency fluctuations. To the extent metal prices decline, we would generally expect lower sales, pricing and possibly lower operating income. Depending on the timing of the price changes and to the extent we are not able to pass on to our customers any increases in our metal raw materials prices, our operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, because we maintain substantial inventories of metals in order to meet short lead-times and the just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers, a reduction in our selling prices could result in lower profitability or, in some cases, losses, either of which could adversely impact\nour ability to remain in compliance with certain provisions of our debt instruments, as well as result in us incurring impairment charges.\nWe service industries that are highly cyclical and impacted by international regulatory concerns, and any downturn in our customers\u2019 industries could reduce our revenue and profitability.\nMany of our products are sold to customers in industries that experience significant fluctuations in demand based on economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand, availability of adequate credit and financing, customer inventory levels, changes in governmental policies and/or regulations and other factors beyond our control, such as acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters or public health issues or pandemics, such as that experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of this volatility in the industries we serve, when one or more of our customers\u2019 industries experiences a decline, we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if we are not able to divert sales of our products to customers in other industries. Historically, we have made a strategic decision to focus sales resources on certain industries, specifically the aerospace, heavy equipment, machine tools and general industrial equipment industries. A downturn in these industries has had, and may in the future continue to have, an adverse effect on our operating results. We are also particularly sensitive to market trends in the manufacturing sectors of the North American economy and the two primary global markets which we serve, aerospace and industrial.\nFor example, in October 2018 and March of 2019, two commercial aircraft accidents led to the grounding by the Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d) and other regulatory bodies of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. While our overall participation on the 737 MAX program is relatively limited both through direct sales and through our customer base, certain of our aerospace customers have significant content on the aircraft. The continued grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX by the FAA and other regulators, which started in March of 2019, caused deliveries of that aircraft to be extremely limited in fiscal year 2020, and has therefore impacted our customers, in some cases significantly. On November 18, 2020, the FAA approved the Boeing 737 MAX to return to commercial service and in some cases the aircraft resumed flying before the end of 2020, although a widespread return to service is not expected until 2021. Based on information currently available, we believe the missed deliveries resulting from the prolonged grounding of the aircraft will be fulfilled in future periods, although at a slower rate than previously estimated. Because Boeing sources large quantities of metal directly from mills for certain of its programs, including the 737 MAX, there could be impacts on our suppliers and market availability of certain products as a result of excesses or shortages. As stated above, our direct exposure to the 737 MAX is relatively limited, and therefore, we do not expect it to have a significant direct impact on sales demand or pricing of our products in 2021. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that a further prolonged grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX could affect our aerospace end markets more broadly than the specific 737 MAX program, and thus could negatively impact our profitability and/or cash flow.\nOur operating results are subject to the seasonal nature of our customers\u2019 businesses.\nA portion of our customers experience seasonal slowdowns. Historically, our revenues in the months of July, November, and December have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of shipping days and holiday or vacation closures for some customers. Dependent on market and economic conditions, our sales in the first two quarters of the year, therefore, can be higher than in the third and fourth quarters due to this seasonality. As a result, analysts and investors may inaccurately estimate the effects of seasonality on our operating results in one or more future quarters and, consequently, our operating results may fall below expectations.\nAn impairment or additional restructuring charge could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce costs and improve operating performance. These actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to asset impairments, employee termination costs, charges for pension benefits, and pension settlement and/or curtailments, which could be significant and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a significant amount of long-lived assets. We review the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever significant events or changes occur which might impair the recovery of recorded costs, making certain assumptions regarding future operating performance. The results of these calculations may be affected by the current demand and any decline in market conditions for our products, as well as interest rates and general economic conditions. If impairment is determined to exist, we will incur impairment losses, which may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nDisruptions or shortages in the supply of raw materials could adversely affect our operating results and our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nOur business requires materials that are sourced from third party suppliers. If, for any reason, our primary suppliers of metals should curtail or discontinue their delivery of raw materials to us at competitive prices and in a timely manner, our operating results could suffer. Unforeseen disruptions in our supply bases, including those resulting from competition, political instability, acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, and public health issues or pandemics (such as COVID-19), among other things, could materially impact our ability to deliver products to customers. The sourcing of certain metals may be highly competitive due to limited supplies and availability. The number of available suppliers could be reduced by factors such as industry consolidation and bankruptcies affecting metals producers, or suppliers may be unwilling or unable to meet our demand due to industry supply conditions. If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of raw materials from our traditional suppliers, we may not be able to obtain such raw materials from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results. To the extent we have quoted prices to customers and accepted orders for products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, or have existing contracts, we may be unable to raise the price of products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials to our customers.\nIn some cases the availability of raw materials requires long lead times. As a result, we may experience delays or shortages in the supply of raw materials. If we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of required raw materials, we may be unable to timely supply customers with sufficient quantities of products. This could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs, or suffer harm to our reputation, all of which may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) is limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses since 2008. As of December 31, 2020, we had United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $24.3 million. The U.S. federal NOLs will expire in various years beginning with 2034. These U.S. federal NOLs reflect the attribute reduction for the cancellation of indebtedness resulting from our bankruptcy proceedings in 2017, as well as the write-off of the statutorily limited losses, which the Company will never be able to utilize due to Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) section 382 limitations. We have determined that an ownership shift of greater than fifty percent occurred in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and as such, a significant portion of the pre-ownership shift NOLs are subject to an annual utilization limitation under IRC section 382 that will act to prevent the Company from utilizing most of its losses against future taxable income. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership that we cannot predict or control that could result in further limitations being placed on our ability to utilize our federal NOLs. In addition, we may not generate future taxable income so that we can use our available NOLs as an offset. As of December 31, 2020, we have a full valuation allowance against our federal and state NOLs that we do not expect to utilize under IRC section 382 as we have concluded, based\non all available evidence, that it is more likely than not that we will not utilize these federal and state NOLs prior to their respective expiration.\nWe operate in international markets, which expose us to a number of risks.\nAlthough a majority of our business activity takes place in the United States, we serve and operate in certain international markets, which exposes us to political, economic and currency related risks, including the following:\n\u25cf currency exchange risk;\n\u25cf changes in tariffs, duties and taxes;\n\u25cf limitations on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u25cf restrictions on imports and exports or sources of supply;\n\u25cf transportation delays or interruptions;\n\u25cf political, social and economic instability and disruptions;\n\u25cf acts of terrorism or war, natural disasters and other public health issues or pandemics;\n\u25cf potential for adverse change in the local political or social climate or in government policies, laws and regulations; and\n\u25cf difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations and the application of foreign labor regulations.\nIn addition to the United States, we operate in Canada, Mexico, France, Singapore, and China. An act of war, terrorism, public health issues or a major pandemic event could disrupt international shipping schedules, cause additional delays in importing or exporting products into or out of any of these countries, including the United States, or increase the costs required to do so. In addition, acts of crime or violence in these international markets could adversely affect our operating results. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies could reduce the value of these assets as reported in our consolidated financial statements, which could reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity. If we do not adequately anticipate and respond to these risks and the other risks inherent in international operations, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nThe imposition of tariffs or duties on imported metals could significantly increase the price of the metals we purchase from international suppliers and/or result in shortages in the supply of raw materials.\nThough we source the majority of our products domestically in the countries in which we operate, we do source some products from international suppliers. The imposition of tariffs or duties on imported metals, other similar measures imposed by the U.S. government, and retaliatory/corresponding measure by other countries, has a pervasive impact on the metals market in which we operate. For example, we may be unable to pass through the higher costs to our customers for the metals we buy internationally, which could adversely impact our competitiveness, financial condition and operating results. Similarly, further decreases in imports could cause a disruption or shortage in the availability of the raw materials that we buy, which could limit our ability to meet customer\u2019s demand or to purchase material at competitive prices. This could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs, or suffer harm to our reputation, all of which may adversely affect our operating results.\nA portion of our workforce is represented by collective bargaining units, which may lead to work stoppages.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 18% of our U.S. employees were represented by the USW under collective bargaining agreements, including hourly warehouse employees at our distribution centers in Cleveland, Ohio and Hammond, Indiana. As these agreements expire, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in concluding collective bargaining agreements with the USW to replace those that expire. Although we believe that our labor relations have generally been satisfactory, we cannot predict how stable our relationships with the USW will be or whether we will be able to meet the USW requirements without impacting our operating results and financial condition. The USW may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Work stoppages and instability in our relationship with the USW could negatively impact the timely processing and shipment of our products, which could strain relationships with customers or suppliers and adversely affect our operating results. Effective May 15, 2018, we entered into a four-year collective bargaining agreement with the USW, which covers approximately 59 employees at our largest facility in Cleveland, Ohio. Approximately 21 employees at our Hammond, Indiana facility are covered by a separate collective bargaining agreement with the USW that was renegotiated effective September 1, 2020 and expires on March 31, 2024.\nWe rely upon our suppliers as to the specifications of the metals we purchase from them.\nWe rely on mill or supplier certifications that attest to the physical and chemical specifications of the metals received from our suppliers for resale and generally, consistent with industry practice, do not undertake independent testing of all such metals. Although our primary sources of products have been domestic suppliers, we have and will continue to purchase product from foreign suppliers when we believe it is appropriate. In the event that metal purchased from domestic suppliers is deemed to not meet quality specifications as set forth in the mill or supplier certifications or customer specifications, we generally have recourse against these suppliers for both the cost of the products purchased and possible claims from our customers. However, such recourse will not compensate us for the damage to our reputation that may arise from sub-standard products and possible losses of customers. Moreover, there is a greater level of risk that similar recourse will not be available to us in the event of claims by our customers related to products from foreign suppliers that do not meet the specifications set forth in the mill or supplier certifications. In such circumstances, we may be at greater risk of loss for claims for which we do not carry, or do not carry sufficient, insurance.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a disruption to our primary distribution hubs.\nOur largest facilities, in Cleveland (Ohio), Hammond (Indiana), and Janesville (Wisconsin) serve as primary distribution centers that ship product to our other facilities as well as external customers. Our business could be adversely impacted by a major disruption at any of these facilities due to unforeseen developments occurring in or around the facility, such as:\n\u25cf damage to or inoperability of our warehouse or related systems;\n\u25cf a prolonged power or telecommunication failure;\n\u25cf a natural disaster, environmental or public health issue or pandemic, or an act of war or terrorism on-site.\nA prolonged disruption of the services and capabilities of these or other of our facilities could adversely impact our operating results.\nDamage to or a disruption in our information technology systems could impact our ability to conduct business and could subject us to liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws.\nDifficulties associated with the design and implementation of our enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) or other information technology systems could adversely affect our business, our customer service and our operating results.\nWe rely primarily on one information technology system to provide inventory availability to our sales and operating personnel, improve customer service through better order and product reference data and monitor operating results. Difficulties associated with upgrades or integration with new systems could lead to business interruption that could harm our reputation, increase our operating costs and decrease profitability.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe could be vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations on our indebtedness, which could hurt our operating results.\nWe are exposed to various interest rate risks that arise in the normal course of business. Market risk arises from changes in interest rates. We currently finance our operations with both fixed rate and variable rate borrowings, and the fair market value of our $149.9 million of fixed rate borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2020 may be impacted by changes in interest rates. In addition, if in the future interest rates subsequently increase significantly, it could significantly increase the interest expense on our variable rate borrowings which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.\nPotential environmental legislative and regulatory actions could impose significant costs on the operations of our customers and suppliers, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAs a metals distributor, our operations do not emit significant amounts of greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d). However, the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers and customers are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions. Any adopted future climate change and GHG legislative or regulatory measures may impose significant costs on the operations of our customers and suppliers and indirectly impact our operations. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future legislation and regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber and other security threats or disruptions.\nWe face various cyber and other security threats, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information and computer networks. Unauthorized or inappropriate access to, or use of, our computer networks or systems may be intentional, unintentional or a result of criminal activity. Such unauthorized or inappropriate access may lead to the corruption of data, which could cause interruption in our operations or damage our computer systems or those of our customers or vendors. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could also gain unauthorized access to confidential, proprietary, personal or other sensitive information or capabilities, which may belong to third parties, our employees or us.\nThe occurrence of such threats, attacks or incidents exposes us to risk of loss and possible claims brought by our customers, employees or other parties with whom we have commercial relationships, as well as actions by government regulators. In addition to potential legal liability, these activities may interfere with our ability to provide our products and services. Further, a perception that our security measures are ineffective against security incidents could damage our reputation, and we could lose employees, customers or vendors. Any of these occurrences could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThus, the success of our business depends on the security of our computer networks and systems and, in part, on the security of the computer networks and systems of our third-party vendors. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate the risk of these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques\nor to implement adequate preventative measures. We also cannot give assurance that the security measures of our third-party vendors, including network and system providers, providers of customer and vendor support services and other vendors will be adequate. Thus, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by such breaches.",

Castle & Co.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Amounts in thousands except par value and per share data)\n(1) Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of operations - A.M. Castle & Co. and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a specialty metals distribution company serving customers on a global basis. The Company has operations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, France, Spain, China and Singapore. The Company provides a broad range of products and value-added processing and supply chain services to a wide array of customers. The Company\u2019s customers are principally within the producer durable equipment, aerospace, heavy industrial equipment, industrial goods, construction equipment, and retail sectors of the global economy. Particular focus is placed on the aerospace and defense, power generation, mining, heavy industrial equipment, and general manufacturing industries, as well as general engineering applications.\nThe Company\u2019s corporate headquarters is located in Oak Brook, Illinois. The Company has 21 operational service centers located throughout North America (16), Europe (2) and Asia (3).\nThe Company purchases metals from many producers. Purchases are made in large lots and held in distribution centers until sold, usually in smaller quantities and often with value-added processing services performed. Orders are primarily filled with materials shipped from the Company\u2019s stock. The materials required to fill the balance of sales are obtained from other sources, such as direct mill shipments to customers or purchases from other distributors. Thousands of customers from a wide array of industries are serviced primarily through the Company\u2019s own sales organization.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn December 28, 2020, the Company filed articles of amendment to effect a reverse split of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock, pursuant to Section 2-309(e) of the Maryland General Corporation Law, whereby each 10 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of December 29, 2020 was combined into one whole share of common stock (the \u201cReverse Split\u201d). No fractional shares of common stock were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. In lieu of issuing any fractional shares to any stockholder as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the Company made, to any stockholder that would otherwise hold a fractional share after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split, a cash payment in an amount equal to $0.70 multiplied by the number of pre-split shares held by such stockholder with respect to which a fractional share would be issued. Stockholders of record who owned less than 10 shares of common stock prior to the Reverse Split were cashed out and will no longer be stockholders of the Company.\nAll references to numbers of shares and per share data in these consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted to account for the Reverse Split for all periods presented.\nBasis of presentation - The consolidated financial statements included herein and the notes thereto have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). This report contains consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the Company continuing as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The Company\u2019s principal source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and borrowings under its asset-based revolving credit facilities.\nUse of estimates - The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The principal areas of estimation reflected in the consolidated financial statements are accounts receivable allowances, inventory reserves, the valuation of intangible assets, the valuation of deferred income taxes, the fair value of the borrowings under the Company\u2019s Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (as amended, the \u201cABL Credit Agreement\u201d), the Company\u2019s 3.00% / 5.00% Convertible Senior Secured Paid In Kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) Toggle Notes due 2024 (the \u201c3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes\u201d), the Company\u2019s 5.00% / 7.00% Convertible Senior Secured Paid In Kind (PIK) Toggle Notes due 2022 (the \u201c5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes\u201d, and together with the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes, the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d), and pension and other post-employment benefits.\nRevenue recognition - Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when control of the product has transferred to the customer, which is primarily at the time of shipment to the customer. Revenue recognized other than at the time of shipment represented less than 1% of the Company\u2019s consolidated net sales in both the year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019. Customer payment terms are established prior to the time of shipment. Provisions for allowances related to sales discounts and rebates are recorded based on terms of the sale in the period that the sale is recorded. Management utilizes historical information and the current sales trends of the business to estimate such provisions. The provisions related to discounts and rebates due to customers are recorded as a reduction within net sales.\nRevenue from shipping and handling charges is recorded in net sales. Costs incurred in connection with shipping and handling the Company\u2019s products, which are related to third-party carriers or performed by Company personnel, are included in warehouse, processing and delivery expenses. In the year ended December 31, 2020 and the year ended December 31, 2019, shipping and handling costs included in warehouse, processing and delivery expenses were $19,686 and $23,807, respectively. The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities as fulfillment costs and not a promised good or service.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts related to the potential inability of customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific identification of customer receivable balances for which collection is unlikely. The provision for doubtful accounts is recorded in sales, general and administrative expense in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Estimates of doubtful accounts are based on historical write-off experience as a percentage of net sales and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers. The Company increased its allowance for doubtful accounts during the year ended December 31 2020 primarily in response to certain customers that declared bankruptcy due to ongoing financial hardship. The Company continues to consider the economic impact of the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic as well as the currently unfavorable economic conditions on the collectability of customer accounts receivable. The Company continues to experience slower than usual payments from customers due to the financial uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to analyze any financial and commercial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any adverse impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the collectability of customer accounts receivable.\nThe Company also maintains an allowance for credit memos for estimated credit memos to be issued against current sales. Estimates of allowance for credit memos are based upon the application of a historical issuance lag period to the average credit memos issued each month.\nAccounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos activity is presented in the table below:\n(a) Includes the net amount of credit memos reserved and issued.\nThe Company does not incur significant incremental costs when obtaining customer contracts and any costs that are incurred are generally not recoverable from its customers. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s customer contracts are for a duration of less than one year and individual customer purchase orders for contractual customers are fulfilled within one year of the purchase order date. The Company recognizes incremental costs of obtaining a contract, if any, as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset would have been one year or less. The Company does not have any costs to obtain a contract that are capitalized.\nInformation regarding the disaggregation of the Company\u2019s revenue by geographic region can be found at Note 10 - Segment Reporting.\nCost of materials - Cost of materials consists of the costs the Company pays for metals and related inbound and transfer freight charges. It excludes depreciation, which is discussed below.\nOperating expenses - Operating costs and expenses primarily consist of:\n\u25cf Warehouse, processing and delivery expenses, including occupancy costs, compensation and employee benefits for warehouse personnel, processing, shipping and handling costs;\n\u25cf Sales expenses, including compensation and employee benefits for sales personnel;\n\u25cf General and administrative expenses, including compensation for executive officers and general management, expenses for professional services primarily attributable to accounting and legal advisory services, bad debt expenses, data communication costs, computer hardware and maintenance expenses and occupancy costs for non-warehouse locations; and\n\u25cf Depreciation includes depreciation for all property, plant and equipment.\nCash equivalents - Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments that have an original maturity of 90 days or less.\nStatement of cash flows - Non-cash investing and financing activities and supplemental disclosures of consolidated cash flow information are as follows:\nInventories - Inventories consist primarily of finished goods. All of the Company\u2019s operations use the average cost method in determining the cost of inventory.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory. The excess and obsolete inventory allowance is determined through the specific identification of material, adjusted for expected scrap value to be received, based on previous sales experience.\nExcess and obsolete inventory allowance activity is presented in the table below:\nProperty, plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and include assets held under capital leases. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repair costs that do not substantially improve or extend the useful lives of the respective assets are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. When items are disposed, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income.\nThe Company provides for depreciation of plant and equipment sufficient to amortize the cost over their estimated useful lives as follows:\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the remaining term of the lease. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method. Depreciation expense in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $7,872 and $8,759, respectively.\nLong-lived assets - The Company\u2019s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future net cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If future net cash flows are less than the carrying value, the asset or asset group may be impaired. If such assets are impaired, the impairment charge is calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount, and the asset\u2019s residual value, if any. The Company derives the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from historical experience and internal business plans.\nGoodwill and intangible assets - As December 31, 2019, the Company had recorded goodwill with a carrying value of $2,676, none of which was tax deductible. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has spread across the globe to many countries in which the Company does business and is impacting worldwide economic activity, the Company has determined that the potential impact on its business, including, but not limited to, a potential decrease in revenue, supply chain disruptions and/or facility closures, represented facts and circumstances indicating that it was likely that its goodwill and indefinite lived trade name could be impaired, and performed interim impairment tests. Based on the results of the Company's interim goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter of 2020, the Company determined its goodwill was impaired. The Company\nrecorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $2,676 during the year ended December 31, 2020, reducing the remaining balance of its goodwill to zero as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company\u2019s intangible asset is comprised of an indefinite-lived trade name, which is not subject to amortization. The gross carrying value of the Company\u2019s trade name intangible asset was $5,500 at both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The indefinite-lived trade name intangible asset is tested for impairment on an annual basis on December 1 of each year or more frequently if significant events or changes in circumstances occur which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, as measured by comparing carrying value to the estimated future cash flows generated by its use. An impaired asset is recorded at estimated fair value, determined principally using an income-based approach similar to the relief from royalty method used in the initial valuation of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, with the excess amount of carrying value over the fair value representing the amount of the impairment. Assumptions used in the income-based approach including projected revenues and assumed royalty rate, long-term growth and discount rates. The Company recorded no impairment charges related to its indefinite-lived trade name intangible assets in the year ended December 31, 2020 or since the intangible asset was originally recorded.\nWhile the Company considered the impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on its future cash flows when preparing its interim goodwill and interim and annual intangible asset impairment tests, the full extent of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company's business, operations and financial condition is currently unknown. The Company will continue to assess its indefinite-lived trade name intangible asset for impairment as events and circumstances change.\nLeases - The Company has operating and finance leases covering primarily warehouse and office facilities and equipment, with the lapse of time as the basis for all rental payments. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception.\nOperating right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the estimated present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date, with consideration given to the Company\u2019s recent debt issuances as well as publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rates.\nThe ROU assets also include any lease payments made and are reduced by any lease incentives received. The Company\u2019s lease terms may include options to extend or not terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise any such options. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Lease expense is recognized in operating loss on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term.\nReal estate leases of warehouse and office facilities are the most significant leases held by the Company. For these leases, the Company has elected the practical expedient permitted under ASC 842 to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. As a result, non-lease components, such as common area maintenance charges, are accounted for as a single lease element. The Company\u2019s remaining operating leases are primarily comprised of leases of copiers, vehicles, and other warehouse equipment.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s operating lease agreements include variable payments that are passed through by the landlord, such as insurance, taxes, and common area maintenance, payments based on the usage of the asset, and rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Pass-through charges, payments due to changes in usage of the asset, and payments due to changes in indexation are included within variable rent expense.\nNone of the Company\u2019s lease agreements contain significant residual value guarantees, restrictions, or covenants.\nIncome taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company records valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the amounts will not be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and recent results of operations. In the event the Company determines it would not be able to realize its deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is recorded, which increases the provision for income taxes in the period in which that determination is made.\nDuring 2020, certain of the Company\u2019s foreign assets remained pledged as collateral for certain borrowings. This continues to result in a taxable income inclusion in the U.S. of the annual earnings generated by its foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the enactment of H.R.1, \u201cAn Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018\u201d (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) (also known as \u201cThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d) and this pledge of foreign assets, there are no remaining undistributed earnings which have not been subject to U.S. income taxation as of December 31, 2020 on which the Company would need to record any additional U.S. deferred tax liability.\nFor uncertain tax positions, if any, the Company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance, which requires application of a \u201cmore likely than not\u201d threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions. The Company\u2019s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the Company\u2019s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has no uncertain tax positions for which a tax or interest reserve has been recognized.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, within income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties are included within income tax payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has accrued no interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits.\nInsurance plans - The Company is a member of a group captive insurance company (the \u201cCaptive\u201d) domiciled in Grand Cayman Island. The Captive reinsures losses related to certain of the Company\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation, automobile and general liability risks that occur subsequent to August 2009. Premiums are based on the Company\u2019s loss experience and are accrued as expenses for the period to which the premium relates. Premiums are credited to the Company\u2019s \u201closs fund\u201d and earn investment income until claims are actually paid. For claims that were incurred prior to August 2009, the Company is self-insured. Self-insurance amounts are capped, for individual claims and in the aggregate, for each policy year by an insurance company. Self-insurance reserves are based on unpaid, known claims (including related administrative fees assessed by the insurance company for claims processing) and a reserve for incurred but not reported claims based on the Company\u2019s historical claims experience and development.\nThe Company is self-insured up to a retention amount for medical insurance for its domestic operations. Self-insurance reserves are maintained based on incurred but not paid claims based on a historical lag.\nForeign currency - For the majority of the Company\u2019s operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of those operations are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates, and income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the reporting period. The currency effects of translating financial statements of the Company\u2019s non-U.S. operations which operate in local currency environments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of stockholders\u2019\ndeficit. Transaction gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions have historically been primarily related to unhedged intercompany financing arrangements between the United States and Canada.\nLoss per share - Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus outstanding common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents consist of restricted stock awards and contingently issuable shares related to the Company\u2019s Convertible Notes, which are included in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding using the if-converted method. Refer to Note 2 - Debt, for further description of the Convertible Notes.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of the basic and diluted loss per common share calculations, with shares outstanding adjusted to reflect to effects of the Reverse Split:\nThe computation of diluted loss per common share does not include common shares issuable upon conversion of the Company\u2019s Convertible Notes, as they were anti-dilutive under the if-converted method.\nThe 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at any time at a conversion price of $37.68 per share. The 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at any time at a conversion price of $4.56 per share. In future periods, absent a fundamental change as described in Note 2 - Debt, the outstanding 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes and 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes could increase diluted average shares outstanding by a maximum of approximately 21,800 shares.\nConcentrations - The Company\u2019s customer base is well diversified and, therefore, the Company does not have dependence upon any single customer or a few customers. No single customer represented more than 5% of the Company\u2019s total net sales in either the year ended December 31, 2020 or the year ended December 31, 2019. Approximately 68% of the Company\u2019s net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020, and 64% in the year ended December 31, 2019, were from locations in the United States.\nShare-based compensation - Compensation expense related to restricted share awards made to directors, officers and employees of the Company is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the estimated grant date fair value of the award. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Compensation expense related to performance share unit awards made to senior level managers and other select personnel is based on management\u2019s expectation of future performance compared to the pre-established performance goals. If the performance goals are not expected to be met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.\nNew Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2018-13, \u201cFair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.\u201d ASU No. 2018-13 amends Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) to add, remove, and modify fair value measurement disclosure requirements. The ASU\u2019s changes to disclosures aim to improve the effectiveness of Topic 820's disclosure requirements under the aforementioned FASB disclosure framework project. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of ASU No. 2018-13 in the first quarter of 2020. The Company determined the adoption of the disclosure requirements had no impact on its fair value disclosures herein.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, \u201cIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.\u201d ASU 2019-12 amends ASC 740 to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions for investments, intraperiod allocations and interim calculations, and adding guidance to reduce complexity in the accounting standard under the FASB\u2019s simplification initiative. ASU 2019-12 is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the amendments in ASU 2019-12 should be applied on a prospective basis to all periods presented. The Company adopted the new guidance under ASU 2019-12 in the first quarter of 2020 and removed the exception for intraperiod allocations from its interim period tax provision calculation, accordingly.\nOn March 2, 2020, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No. 33-10762, \"Financial Disclosures About Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities and Affiliates Whose Securities Collateralize a Registrant\u2019s Securities\" (the \u201cfinal rule\u201d). The final rule simplifies the disclosure requirements related to certain registered securities under SEC Regulation S-X, Rules 3-10 and 3-16, which currently require separate financial statements for (1) subsidiary issuers and guarantors of registered debt securities unless certain exceptions are met and (2) affiliates that collateralize registered securities offerings if the affiliates\u2019 securities are a substantial portion of the collateral. Under the final rule, alternative financial disclosures or narrative disclosures (referred to collectively as \u201cAlternative Disclosures\u201d) may be provided in lieu of separate financial statements of the guarantors or affiliates. The amendments in the final rule are generally effective for filings on or after January 4, 2021, with early application permitted. The Company has elected to adopt the amendments of the final rule for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and accordingly, has elected to present the alternative disclosures of the guarantors of its registered securities in Part I Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, of this Form 10-K.\nRecently Issued Account Standards Not Yet Effective\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, \u201cMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\u201d ASU 2016-13 adds a current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) impairment model to U.S. GAAP that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Modified retrospective adoption is required with any cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. ASU 2016-13 is effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within the year of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt the guidance and disclosure requirements of ASU 2016-13 in fiscal year 2023.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, \u201cCompensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Topic 715-20): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plan.\u201d ASU No. 2018-14 amends Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) to add or remove certain disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The ASU\u2019s changes to disclosures aim to improve the effectiveness of Topic 715\u2019s disclosure requirements under the FASB\u2019s disclosure framework project. ASU No. 2018-14 is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. ASU No. 2018-14 does not impact the interim disclosure requirements of Topic 715.\nEarly adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt the disclosure requirements of this new guidance in its consolidated financial statements in fiscal year 2021.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, \u201cReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.\u201d The purpose of ASU 2020-04 is to provide optional guidance for a limited time to ease the potential burden in accounting for, or recognizing the effects of, reference rate reform on financial reporting. In response to concerns about structural risks of interbank offered rates, and, in particular, the risk of cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), reference rate reform refers to a global initiative to identify alternative reference rates that are more observable or transaction-based and less susceptible to manipulation. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. An entity may elect to apply the amendments for contract modifications by topic or industry subtopic as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, or prospectively from a date within an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, up to the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. Once elected for a topic or an industry subtopic, the amendments in ASU 2020-04 must be applied prospectively for all eligible contract modifications for that topic or industry subtopic. The Company is currently assessing the accounting and financial impact of reference rate reform and will consider applying the optional guidance of ASU 2020-04 accordingly.\n(2) Debt\nLong-term debt consisted of the following:\n(a) Included in balance is interest paid in kind of $73 as of December 31, 2020.\n(b) Included in balance is interest paid in kind of $7,581 as of December 31, 2020 and $4,288 as of December 31, 2019.\n(c) Included in balance is interest paid in kind of $3,653 as of December 31, 2020.\n(d) Included in balance is interest paid in kind of $266 as of December 31, 2020 and $28,991 as of December 31, 2019.\n(e) Represents unvested portion of restricted 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes and 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes issued to certain members of management (see Note 6 - Share-based compensation).\nCredit Facilities\nOn August 31, 2017, the Company entered into the Revolving Credit and Security Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association (\u201cPNC\u201d) as lender and as administrative and collateral agent (the \u201cAgent\u201d), and other lenders party thereto (the \u201cOriginal ABL Credit Agreement\u201d). The Original ABL Credit Agreement provided for a $125,000 senior secured, revolving credit facility under which the Company and four of its subsidiaries each are borrowers (collectively, in such capacity, the \u201cBorrowers\u201d). The obligations of the Borrowers have been guaranteed by the subsidiaries of the Company named therein as guarantors.\nOn December 10, 2020 the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (\u201cAmendment No. 3\u201d) by and among the Company, the other borrowers and guarantors party thereto and PNC Bank, National Association as the agent and the lenders, which amends the Original ABL Credit Agreement dated as of August 31, 2017 (as amended to date by Amendment No. 1 to Revolving Credit and Security Agreement, dated June 1, 2018, Amendment No. 2 to Revolving Credit and Security Agreement, dated March 27, 2020, and Amendment No. 3, the \u201cABL Credit Agreement\u201d) to provide for additional borrowing capacity.\nAmendment No. 3 provided for an additional $25,000 Revolving B (Priority) credit facility (the \u201cRevolving B (Priority) Credit Facility\u201d), which is subordinated to the $125,000 senior secured, revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving A Credit Facility\u201d) and senior to $21,500 senior secured, revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving B Credit Facility\u201d). As part of Amendment No. 3, the Company and PNC also agreed to extend the maturity of the ABL Credit Agreement to February 28, 2023, and to amend the ABL Credit Agreement to (i) reduce the available borrowing capacity under its Revolving B Credit Facility from $25,000 to $21,500 and subordinate the payment under the Revolving B Credit Facility to the Revolving B (Priority) Credit Facility, (ii) increase access to available borrowings by reducing the liquidity covenant test threshold from $12,500 to $8,750, and (iii) increase the interest applicable to the Revolving Credit A Facility to LIBOR-base rate plus a margin of 4.0%.\nSubject to certain exceptions and permitted encumbrances, the obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of each of the Borrowers and certain subsidiaries of the Company that are named as guarantors. The proceeds of the advances under the ABL Credit Agreement may only be used to (i) pay certain fees and expenses to the Agent and the lenders under the ABL Credit Agreement, (ii) provide for the Borrowers\u2019 working capital needs and reimburse drawings under letters of credit, (iii) repay the obligations under the Debtor-in-Possession Revolving Credit and Security Agreement dated as of July 10, 2017, by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto, and PNC, and certain other existing indebtedness, and (iv) provide for the Borrowers\u2019 capital expenditure needs, in accordance with the ABL Credit Agreement.\nThe Company may prepay its obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement at any time without premium or penalty, and must apply the net proceeds of material sales of collateral in prepayment of such obligations. Payments made must be applied to the Company\u2019s obligations under the Revolving A Credit Facility, if any, prior to its obligations under the Revolving B Credit Facility. In connection with an early termination or permanent reduction of the Revolving A Credit Facility prior to March 27, 2021, a 0.50% fee shall be due for the period from March 28, 2021 through September 27, 2021 on the amount of such commitment reduction, subject to reduction as set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. Indebtedness for borrowings under the ABL Credit Agreement is subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of specified defaults or events of default, including (i) failure to pay principal or interest, (ii) the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of a loan party, (iii) failure by a loan party to perform certain covenants, (iv) defaults under indebtedness owed to third parties, (v) certain liability producing events relating to ERISA, (vi) the invalidity or impairment of the Agent\u2019s lien on its collateral or of any applicable guarantee, and (vii) certain adverse bankruptcy-related and other events.\nInterest on indebtedness under the Revolving A Credit Facility accrues at a variable rate based on a grid with the highest interest rate being the applicable LIBOR-based rate plus a margin of 4.0%, as set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. Interest on indebtedness under the Revolving B (Priority) Credit Facility and the Revolving\nB Credit Facility accrue at a rate of 15.0% and 12.0% per annum, respectively, which will be paid in kind unless the Company elects to pay such interest in cash and the Revolving B (Priority) and Revolving B payment conditions specified in the ABL Credit Agreement are satisfied. Additionally, the Company must pay a monthly Facility Fee equal to the product of (i) 0.25% per annum (or, if the average daily revolving facility usage is less than 50% of the maximum revolving advance amount, 0.375% per annum) multiplied by (ii) the amount by which the maximum revolving advance amount exceeds such average daily revolving facility usage for such month.\nThe weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Revolving A Credit Facility for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.75% and the weighted average facility fee for the year was 0.25%. The Company pays certain customary recurring fees with respect to the ABL Credit Agreement. Interest expense related to the Revolving B (Priority) Credit Facility of $73 was paid in kind in the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense related to the Revolving B Credit Facility of $3,293 and $2,913 was paid in kind in the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nThe ABL Credit Agreement includes negative covenants customary for an asset-based revolving loan. Such covenants include limitations on the ability of the Borrowers to, among other things, (i) effect mergers and consolidations, (ii) sell assets, (iii) create or suffer to exist any lien, (iv) make certain investments, (v) incur debt and (vi) transact with affiliates. In addition, the ABL Credit Agreement includes customary affirmative covenants for an asset-based revolving loan, including covenants regarding the delivery of financial statements, reports and notices to the Agent. The ABL Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and event of default provisions for a secured term loan.\nThe Company\u2019s ABL Credit Agreement contains a springing financial maintenance covenant requiring the Company to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 in any Covenant Testing Period (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) when the Company\u2019s cash liquidity (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) is less than $8,750. The Company was not in a Covenant Testing Period as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nBoth the Revolving B Credit Facility and the Revolving B (Priority) Credit Facility were made available in part by way of a participation in the Revolving B Credit Facility and the Revolving B (Priority) Credit Facility by stockholders with whom certain members of the Board of Directors are affiliated. Refer to Part III Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConvertible Senior Secured Notes\nOn March 27, 2020, the Company completed an exchange offer and consent solicitation (the \u201cExchange Offer\u201d) to issue its 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes and shares of its common stock in exchange for its 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes, including any accrued and unpaid interest on the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes as of the date in which the Exchange Offer was completed. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Offer, $190,200 in aggregate principal amount of the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes were tendered and accepted and in exchange, the Company issued $95,135 in aggregate principal amount of its 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes and 7,026 shares of its common stock. The 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by all current and future domestic subsidiaries (other than those designated as \"unrestricted subsidiaries\") of the Company (the \"Guarantors\"). An aggregate principal amount of 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes in the amount of $3,693 were not tendered and remained outstanding at the date of Exchange Offer.\nThe 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes have substantially the same terms that the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes had prior to the completion of the Exchange Offer except for the following primary differences: (i) the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes are not exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and have the benefit of registration rights to the holders of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes, (ii) the interest on the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes accrues at the rate of 3.00% per annum if paid in cash and at the rate of 5.00% per annum if paid in kind, compared to interest on the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes, which accrues at the rate of 5.00% per annum if paid in cash and at the rate of 7.00% per annum if paid in kind,\nand (iii) the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes have a maturity date of August 31, 2024, compared to the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes, which have a maturity date of August 31, 2022.\nIn conjunction with the Exchange Offer, on March 27, 2020, the Company, the guarantors of the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes and the trustee for the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes entered into a supplemental indenture to the indenture governing the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes (the \u201c5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes Indenture\u201d) to provide for, among other things, the elimination or amendment of substantially all of the restrictive covenants, the release of all collateral securing the Company\u2019s obligations under the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes Indenture, and the modification of certain of the events of default and various other provisions contained in the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes Indenture (the \"Supplemental Indenture\").\nAlso on March 27, 2020, PNC (in its capacity as \u201cFirst Lien Agent\u201d), the trustee for the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes and the Company and certain of its subsidiaries executed an intercreditor agreement (the \u201cNew Intercreditor Agreement\u201d) providing for the lien priority of the first lien facility over the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes. The terms and conditions of the New Intercreditor Agreement are substantially consistent with those applicable to the intercreditor agreement between the First Lien Agent and the trustee for the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes prior to the completion of the Exchange Offer (the \u201c5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes Intercreditor Agreement\u201d). PNC and the trustee for the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes also entered into an amendment of the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes Intercreditor Agreement to, among other things, remove certain limitations and rights of the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes with respect to the first lien facility.\nThe 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the \u201c3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture\u201d), which the Company and the Guarantors entered into with Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as trustee and collateral agent (\"Indenture Agent\"), on March 27, 2020. The 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes are, secured by a lien on all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, its domestic subsidiaries and certain of its foreign subsidiaries, which lien the Indenture Agent has agreed will be junior to the lien of the Agent under the ABL Credit Agreement.\nThe 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at any time at a conversion price of $4.56 per share (after giving effect to an adjustment triggered by the Reverse Split), which rate is subject to further adjustment as set forth in the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture. Under the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture, upon the conversion of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes in connection with a Fundamental Change (as defined in the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture), for each $1.00 principal amount of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes, that number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock issuable upon conversion shall equal the greater of (a) $1.00 divided by the then applicable conversion price or (b) $1.00 divided by the price paid per share of the Company's common stock in connection with such Fundamental Change calculated in accordance with the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture, subject to other provisions of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture. Subject to certain exceptions, under the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture a \u201cFundamental Change\u201d includes, but is not limited to, the following: (i) the acquisition of more than 50% of the voting power of the Company\u2019s common equity by a \u201cperson\u201d or \u201cgroup\u201d within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; (ii) the consummation of any recapitalization, reclassification, share exchange, consolidation or merger of the Company pursuant to which the Company\u2019s common stock will be converted into cash, securities or other property; (iii) the \u201cContinuing Directors\u201d (as defined in the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture) cease to constitute at least a majority of the board of directors; and (iv) the approval of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the Company by the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nThe 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at any time at a conversion price of $37.68 per share (after giving effect to an adjustment triggered by the Reverse Split), which rate is subject to further adjustment as set forth in the Supplemental Indenture. Under the Supplemental Indenture, the conversion of the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes in connection with a Fundamental Change (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture) is substantially the same as under the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture, other than the applicable conversion price.\nUpon conversion of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes and/or the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes, the Company will pay and/or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or a\ncombination of cash and shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, at the Company\u2019s election, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares. The value of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock for purposes of the settlement of the conversion right, if the Company elects to settle in cash, will be calculated as provided in the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture or Supplemental Indenture, as applicable, using a 20 trading day observation period.\nAs discussed previously, the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holder, although the Company, at its own election, may pay and/or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination thereof. As of March 27, 2020, the date of the Exchange Offer, the Company determined that the conversion option was not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes, nor did the conversion option meet the own equity scope exception as the Company at that time did not have sufficient authorized and unissued common stock shares to satisfy the maximum number of common stock shares that could be required to be issued upon conversion. As a result, the Company concluded that the embedded conversion option must be bifurcated from the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes, separately valued, and accounted for as a derivative liability, which was classified in long term debt and marked to fair value through earnings.\nOn June 30, 2020, the Company filed articles of amendment to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized (see Note 8 - Stockholders' Equity). As a result of this increase, the number of the Company's common stock shares available for issuance upon conversion of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes is sufficient to allow the conversion option to be share-settled in full. The Company concluded that as of June 30, 2020 the conversion option qualified for equity classification and the bifurcated derivative liability no longer needed to be accounted for as a separate derivative on a prospective basis from the date of reassessment. As of June 30, 2020, the fair value of the conversion option of $36,952 was classified to equity as additional paid-in capital. The remaining debt discount that arose at the date of debt issuance from the original bifurcation will continue to be amortized through interest expense.\nThe 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain subsidiaries of the Company. The 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes and the related guarantees are secured by a lien on substantially all of the Company\u2019s and the guarantors\u2019 assets, subject to certain exceptions pursuant to certain collateral documents pursuant to the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture. The terms of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes contain numerous covenants imposing financial and operating restrictions on the Company's business. These covenants place restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to, among other things, pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions or restricted payments; incur indebtedness or issue certain stock; make certain investments; create liens; agree to certain payment restrictions affecting certain subsidiaries; sell or otherwise transfer or dispose assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; and enter into sale and leaseback transactions.\nNeither the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes nor the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes may be redeemed by the Company in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity, except the Company may be required to make an offer to purchase the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes using the proceeds of certain material asset sales involving the Company or one of its restricted subsidiaries, as described more particularly in the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture. In addition, if a Fundamental Change (as defined in the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, as applicable) occurs at any time, each holder of any 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes or 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes has the right to require the Company to repurchase such holder\u2019s notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Company must use the net proceeds of material sales of collateral, which proceeds are not used for other permissible purposes, to make an offer of repurchase to holders of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes. Indebtedness for borrowings under the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture is subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of specified defaults or events of default as set forth under each such indenture, including failure to pay principal or interest, the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of any obligor, failure by an obligor to perform certain covenants, the invalidity or impairment of the Agent\u2019s lien on its collateral under the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture, the invalidity or impairment of any applicable guarantee, and certain adverse bankruptcy-related and other events.\nUpon satisfaction of certain conditions more particularly described in the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture, including the deposit in trust of cash or securities sufficient to pay the principal of and interest and any premium on the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes, the Company may effect a covenant defeasance of certain of the covenants imposing financial and operating restrictions on the Company\u2019s business. In addition, and subject to certain exceptions as more particularly described in the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture, the Company may amend, supplement or waive provisions of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture with the consent of holders representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes, and may in effect release collateral from the liens securing the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes with the consent of holders representing 66.67% in aggregate principal amount of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes.\nInterest on the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes accrues at the rate of 3.00% per annum if paid in cash and at the rate of 5.00% per annum if paid in kind, payable quarterly beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2020. Interest on the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes continues to accrue at the rate of 5.00% per annum if paid in cash and at the rate of 7.00% per annum if paid in kind, payable quarterly. Pursuant to the terms of both the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, the Company is currently paying interest on both the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes and the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes in kind. Interest expense related to the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes of $3,653 was paid in kind in the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense related to the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes of $3,483 and $12,999 was paid in kind in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn addition to certain members of management, certain stockholders and (including stockholders with whom members of the Board of Directors are affiliated) received 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes in the Exchange Offer and continue to hold the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes. Refer to Part III Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company determined that the Exchange Offer was considered to be a troubled debt restructuring within the scope of ASC No. 470-60, \"Debt-Troubled Debt Restructurings\". Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company has expensed legal and other direct costs incurred in conjunction with the Exchange Offer in the amount of $1,376 in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss and recognized additional legal and other direct costs incurred also in the amount $1,376 as a decrease to additional paid-in capital for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOther long-term debt\nThe Company qualified under the \u201calternative size standard\u201d for a forgivable loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) administered by the Small Business Association (SBA) pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act. On April 28, 2020, the Company entered into an unsecured PPP loan in the aggregate principal amount of $10,000, which is to be used only for payroll expenses, rent, utilities, mortgage interest, and interest on other pre-existing indebtedness (the \"PPP Loan\"). After taking into account, among other things, the disruptions to the Company\u2019s business activities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the completed Exchange Offer, its available, committed primary sources of liquidity, and its lack of access to alternative sources of liquidity, economic conditions at that time made this loan request necessary and appropriate to support the Company\u2019s ongoing U.S. operations and mitigate potentially significant detriment to the Company\u2019s business. The PPP Loan, which is evidenced by a Paycheck Protection Program Term Note, matures on April 28, 2022 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 1.0% per annum, with the first six months of interest deferred. The PPP Loan is payable in 10 monthly payments commencing on August 15, 2021 and may be prepaid at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties.\nUnder the terms of the CARES Act and the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act passed on June 5, 2020 (the \"PPPFA\"), the PPP Loan, and interest accrued thereon, is forgivable, partially or in full, subject to certain conditions, including the extent to which the PPP Loan proceeds are used for permissible purposes within the 24 week period following loan disbursement (which period was extended by the PPPFA from the eight week period originally allowed by the CARES Act). The Company believes it has used the PPP Loan proceeds for permissible purposes only and intends to apply for forgiveness of the PPP Loan in accordance with the terms of the PPP, the CARES Act and the PPPFA. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has\nrecorded the amount of the PPP Loan due within one year in the current portion of long-term debt and the remainder in long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn June 24, 2020, the Company's French subsidiary entered into a \u20ac6,000 term loan (the \"France Term Loan\"). The France Term Loan, which is fully guaranteed by the French government, is part of a relief program related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar to the PPP Loan, economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic made this France Term Loan necessary and appropriate to support the Company\u2019s ongoing operations in France and mitigate potentially significant detriment to the Company\u2019s business in France. The France Term Loan, which is evidenced by a term note with HSBC Bank, matures on June 24, 2021 and bears no interest. However, in connection with the government guarantee of the France Term Loan, the Company must pay a commission to the French government of 0.5% per annum of the principal loan balance. Under the terms of the France Term Loan, the Company has the option to extend the maturity of the loan for a period of up to five years. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has the intent and ability to extend the maturity of the France Term Loan beyond twelve months and has therefore included the entire outstanding principal balance of the France Term Loan in long-term debt at the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nShort-term borrowings\nOn July 20, 2020, the Company's China subsidiary entered into a local banking line of credit of 20.0 million yuan (approximately $3,025) with the Bank of Communication Shanghai (the \"China Credit Facility\"). The China Credit Facility has a maturity date of March 1, 2021 and accrues interest at a rate of 3.6% per annum. As of December 31, 2020, borrowings under the China Credit Facility of $3,025 were classified as short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company\u2019s French subsidiary is party to a local credit facility under which it may borrow against 100% of the eligible accounts receivable factored, with recourse, up to \u20ac6,500. The French subsidiary is charged a factoring fee of 0.16% of the gross amount of accounts receivable factored. Local currency borrowings on the French subsidiary\u2019s credit facility are charged interest at the daily 3-months Euribor rate plus a 1.0% margin and U.S dollar borrowings on the credit facility are 3-months LIBOR plus a 1.0% margin. The French subsidiary utilizes the local credit facility to support its operating cash needs. As of December 31, 2020, the French subsidiary had no borrowings under the local credit facility and had borrowings of $2,888 under the local credit facility as of December 31, 2019. The Company records borrowings under the local credit facility as short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(3) Fair Value Measurements\nThe three-tier value hierarchy the Company utilizes, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies, is:\nLevel 1-Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2-Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3-Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.\nThe fair value of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values. The fair value of cash equivalents is determined using the fair value hierarchy described above.\nThe Company\u2019s pension plan asset portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 is primarily invested in fixed income securities, which generally fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Fixed income securities in the pension plan asset portfolio are valued based on evaluated prices provided to the trustee by independent\npricing services. Such prices may be determined by factors which include, but are not limited to, market quotations, yields, maturities, call features, ratings, institutional size trading in similar groups of securities and developments related to specific securities. Refer to Note 7 - Employee Benefit Plans for pension fair value disclosures.\nFair Value Measurements of Debt\nAs of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Company\u2019s 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes, including the conversion option, was estimated to be $108,298 compared to a face value of $98,788. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Company\u2019s 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes, including the conversion option, was estimated to be $3,728 compared to a face value of $3,958. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of the Company\u2019s 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes, including the conversion option, was estimated to be $136,085 compared to a face of $193,660. The fair value of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2020 and the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2019 was determined using a binomial lattice model using assumptions based on market information and historical data, and a review of prices and terms available for similar debt instruments that do not contain a conversion feature, as well as other factors related to the callable nature of the Convertible Notes, which is a Level 3 input as defined by the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2020 was estimated based on a model that discounted future principal and interest payments at interest rates available to the Company at the end of the period for similar debt of the same maturity, which is a Level 2 input as defined by the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following valuation assumptions were used in determining the fair value of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes, including the conversion option, at December 31, 2020:\nAs of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Company\u2019s Revolving B (Priority) Credit Facility was estimated to be $8,376 compared to a face value of $8,073. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Company\u2019s Revolving B Credit Facility was estimated to be $28,423 compared to a face value of $29,081. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of the Company\u2019s Revolving B Credit Facility was estimated to be $25,082 compared to a face value of $25,788. Also as of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Company's PPP Loan was estimated to be $8,901 compared to a face value of $10,000 and the fair value of the Company's France Term Loan was estimated to be $3,592 compared to a face value of $7,380.\nThe fair value of the Revolving B (Priority) Credit Facility, the Revolving B Credit Facility, the PPP Loan and the France Term Loan were estimated based on a model that discounted future principal and interest payments at interest rates available to the Company at the end of the period for similar debt of the same maturity, which is a Level 2 input as defined by the fair value hierarchy.\nGiven the nature and the variable interest rates, the fair value of borrowings under the Revolving A Credit Facility and the French subsidiary\u2019s foreign line of credit approximated the carrying value at December 31, 2020.\nFair Value Measurement of Embedded Conversion Feature\nOn June 30, 2020, the Company filed articles of amendment to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized (see Note 5 - Stockholders' Equity). As a result of this increase, the number the Company's common stock shares available for issuance upon conversion of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes is sufficient to allow the conversion option to be share-settled in full. The Company concluded that as of June 30, 2020, the conversion option qualified for equity classification and the bifurcated derivative liability no longer needed to be\naccounted for as a separate derivative on a prospective basis from the date of reassessment. As of June 30, 2020, the fair value of the conversion option of $36,952 was classified to equity as additional paid-in capital. There was no tax impact of the reclassification of the conversion option to equity. The estimated fair value of the derivative liability for the embedded conversion feature of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes, which falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, is measured on a recurring basis using a binomial lattice model using the same assumptions as the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes. The following reconciliation represents the change in fair value of the embedded conversion feature of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes for the year ended December 31, 2020. Prior to the reclassification of the embedded conversion feature to additional paid-in capital on June 30, 2020, the Company recognized a gain of $2,010 on the mark-to-fair value adjustment on the embedded debt conversion option.\n(4) Lease Agreements\nLease-related assets and liabilities consisted of the following:\nLease-related expenses were as follows:\n(1) Relates primarily to one property that was subleased through September 2020.\nLease-related supplemental cash flow information was as follows:\nMaturities of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\n(5) Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nExchange Offer\nThe Company issued 7,026 shares of its common stock on March 27, 2020 in connection with the Exchange Offer (see Note 2 - Debt). The issuance of these shares was recorded using the fair value of the Company's common stock on the date the shares were issued and resulted in an increase in the par value of common stock and additional paid-in capital of $70 and $25,239, respectively. The shares were issued in exchange for 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes, and, as such, the Company received no cash proceeds as part of the exchange.\nAuthorized Shares of Common Stock\nOn June 30, 2020, the Company's shareholders approved a proposal to amend the Company's charter to authorize an increase in the Company's authorized shares of common stock. Subsequent to this approval, also on June 30, 2020, the Company filed articles of amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Maryland, which amended its Articles of Amendment and Restatement effective on such date to increase the Company's authorized common stock shares from 200,000 shares of common stock at $0.01 par value per share to 400,000 shares of common stock at $0.01 par value per share. The Company concluded that as of June 30, 2020 the conversion option associated with its 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes qualified for equity classification and the bifurcated derivative liability no longer needed to be accounted for as a separate derivative on a prospective basis from the date of reassessment. On June 30, 2020, the fair value of the conversion option of $36,952 was classified to equity as additional paid-in capital.\nThe Company has classified the fair value of the conversion option associated with its 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes as additional paid-in capital. Similarly, the interest paid-in kind attributable to the fair value conversion option of the 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes is classified as additional paid-in capital. Interest paid-in kind attributable to the fair value of the conversion option recognized as additional paid-in capital was $788 in the year ended December 31, 2020, net of the tax impact of $281, and $3,547, net of the tax impact of $1,086, in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn December 28, 2020, the Company filed articles of amendment to effect a reverse stock split of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock, pursuant to Section 2-309(e) of the Maryland General Corporation Law, whereby each 10 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of December 29, 2020 was combined into one whole share of common stock (the \u201cReverse Split\u201d). No fractional shares of common stock were issued as a result of the Reverse Split. In lieu of issuing any fractional shares to any stockholder as a result of the Reverse Split, the Company made, to any stockholder that would otherwise hold a fractional share after giving effect to the Reverse Split, a cash payment in an amount equal to $0.70 multiplied by the number of pre-split shares held by such stockholder with respect to which a fractional share would have been issued. Stockholders of record who owned less than 10 shares of common stock prior to the Reverse Split were cashed out and are no longer stockholders of the Company.\nAccumulated Comprehensive Loss\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows:\nChanges in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income by component are as follows:\n(a) See reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss table below for details of reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nReclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows:\n(a) The total reclassifications for the period are included in other (income) expense, net.\n(6) Share-based Compensation\nProvisions governing the Company\u2019s share-based compensation awards are included in the A.M. Castle & Co. 2017 Management Incentive Plan (the \u201cMIP\u201d), which became effective on August 31, 2017. The Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) or a committee thereof (either, in such capacity, the \u201cAdministrator\u201d) administers the MIP. The Administrator has broad authority under the MIP, among other things, to: (i) select participants; (ii) determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the MIP, of any award granted under the MIP; (iii) determine the number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to be covered by each award granted under the MIP; and (iv) determine the fair market value of awards granted under the MIP.\nPersons eligible to receive awards under the MIP include officers, directors and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The types of awards that may be granted under the MIP include, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, restricted Convertible Notes, performance units, performance shares and other forms of cash or share-based awards.\nThe maximum number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the MIP (including shares initially convertible as a result of conversion of Convertible Notes issued pursuant to the MIP) is 395, which number may be increased with the approval of the Company\u2019s shareholders. If any outstanding award granted under the MIP expires or is terminated or canceled without\nhaving been exercised or settled in full, or if shares of the Company\u2019s common stock acquired pursuant to an award subject to forfeiture are forfeited, the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock allocable to the terminated portion of such award or such forfeited shares will revert to the MIP and will be available for grant under the MIP as determined by the Administrator, subject to certain restrictions.\nAs is customary in management incentive plans of this nature, in the event of any change in the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock by reason of a stock split, stock dividend or other non-recurring dividends or distributions, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of stock, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar corporate transaction, an equitable adjustment will be made in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the MIP. Such adjustment may include an adjustment to the maximum number and kind of shares of stock or other securities or other equity interests as to which awards may be granted under the MIP, the number and kind of shares of stock or other securities or other equity interests subject to outstanding awards and the exercise price thereof, if applicable.\nRestricted Shares\nThe Board has issued restricted shares of the Company's common stock (\"Restricted Shares\") and restricted 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes (the \"Restricted 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes\") to certain officers of the Company, as well as Restricted Shares to certain members of the Board. On March 27, 2020, in conjunction with the Exchange Offer, the Company issued restricted 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes (the \"Restricted 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes\") and Restricted Shares in exchange for all of the outstanding Restricted 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes, including any accrued and unpaid interest on the Restricted 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes as of the date in which the Exchange Offer was completed (the \"Restricted Note Exchange\"). Pursuant to the Restricted Note Exchange, $1,613 in aggregate principal amount of the Restricted 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes were tendered and accepted and in exchange, the Company issued $793 in aggregate principal amount of Restricted 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes and 586 shares of Restricted Shares. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate principal amount of Restricted 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes outstanding was $137 and were convertible into an additional 30 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Restricted Shares granted to certain officers of the Company on September 1, 2017 cliff vested on August 31, 2020. As they relate to the first tranche of Restricted 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes, the Restricted 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes and Restricted Shares issued as a result of the Restricted Note Exchange also cliff vested on August 31, 2020. As they relate to the second tranche of Restricted 5.00%/7.00% Convertible Notes, which were made available as lapsed incentive awards and awarded to certain officers of the Company on March 25, 2020, the Restricted 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes, and Restricted Shares issued as a result of the Restricted Note Exchange cliff vest on August 31, 2024.\nThe following table summarizes the activity relating to the Company\u2019s Restricted Shares for the year ended December 31, 2020:\nPerformance Share Units\nThe Board has granted performance share unit awards (\u201cPSUs\u201d) under the MIP to non-executive senior level managers and other select personnel. The PSUs contain a performance-based condition tied to the enterprise value of the Company. Each PSU that vests entitles the participant to receive, at the discretion of the Board, either one share of the Company\u2019s common stock or cash equal to the fair market value of one share of the Company\u2019s common stock. Vesting occurs upon achievement of a defined enterprise value of the Company, with 50% vesting upon achievement of the defined enterprise value between the performance period September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2022, and the remaining 50% vesting upon the achievement of the defined enterprise value as a result of a specified transaction, as defined in the PSU agreement, on or before September 30, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were 75 PSUs outstanding.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nAs of December 31, 2020, the unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested Restricted Shares was $39 and the remaining unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.6 years. As discussed in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, the Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the unrecognized compensation expense related to the Restricted 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes was $94 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years. The Company is recognizing this expense on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period using the fair value of the Restricted 3.00%/5.00% Convertible Notes at the issue date.\nCompensation expense recognized related to the PSUs is based on management\u2019s expectation of future performance compared to the pre-established performance goals. If the performance goals are not expected to be met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. As of December 31, 2020, no compensation expense was recognized for these awards to date as the threshold for expense recognition for the performance-based condition had not been met.\nTotal share-based compensation expense was $816 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $2,862 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(7) Employee Benefit Plans\nPension Plans\nCertain employees of the Company are covered by a Company-sponsored qualified pension plan and a supplemental non-qualified, unfunded pension plan (collectively, the \u201cPension Plans\u201d). These Pension Plans are defined benefit, noncontributory plans. Benefits paid to retirees are based upon age at retirement, years of credited service and average earnings. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for the pension plans.\nThe Company-sponsored pension plans are frozen for all employees except for employees represented by the United Steelworkers of America. The assets of the Company-sponsored qualified pension plan are maintained in a single trust account.\nEffective January 1, 2017, the Company opened a lump-sum payout option to participants and their surviving spouses eligible to receive postretirement defined benefit pension payments under the Company-sponsored qualified pension plan. Eligible pension plan participants were provided the opportunity to elect to receive a one-time lump-sum payment equal to the actuarial equivalent present value of the participant\u2019s accrued benefit payable at the participant\u2019s normal retirement date. Pension benefit payments paid from pension plan assets\nunder the lump-sum payout options were $2,436 and $3,375 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nThe Company\u2019s funding policy is to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d). Based upon factors known and considered as of December 31, 2020, including the funding requirements under ERISA, the Company does not anticipate making significant cash contributions to the pension plans in 2021.\nComponents of net periodic pension plans benefit were as follows:\nThe Company expects no amortization of pension prior service cost and amortization of actuarial loss of $52 for the next fiscal year.\nThe status of the Pension Plans was as follows:\nFor the plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $5,762, $5,762 and $0, respectively, at December 31, 2020, and $5,499, $5,499 and $0, respectively, at December 31, 2019.\nThe assumptions used to measure the projected benefit obligations of the Company\u2019s Pension Plans were as follows:\nThe assumptions used to determine net periodic pension cost of the Company\u2019s Pension Plans were as follows:\nThe Company\u2019s expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and historical and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. The Company\u2019s analysis gives consideration to historical returns and long-term, prospective rates of return.\nFor salaried and hourly, non-union participants, the Pension Plans were frozen in July 2008. As a result, the projected benefit obligations or net periodic pension cost are based on the accrued benefit as of that date and the Company has not used a projected annual salary increase assumption. For hourly, union participants, the accrued benefit is based on a multiplier that is pre-defined per the agreement governing the Pension Plans, which includes the accrued benefit for the participant\u2019s vacation pay that is based on the participant\u2019s final hourly rate at retirement. Therefore, the projected benefit obligations or expense for hourly, union participants in the Pension Plans assumes a 3% projected annual salary increase for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe assets of the Company-sponsored qualified pension plan are allocated primarily to fixed income securities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nThe assets of the Company-sponsored qualified pension plan are managed in accordance with investment policies recommended by its investment advisor and approved by the human resources committee of the board of directors (the \u201cCommittee\u201d). The overall target portfolio allocation is 100% fixed income securities. These funds\u2019 conformance with style profiles and performance is monitored regularly by management, with the assistance of the Company\u2019s investment advisor. Adjustments are typically made in the subsequent quarters when investment allocations deviate from the target range. The investment advisor provides quarterly reports to management and the Committee.\nIn accordance with ASU No. 2015-07, \u201cFair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value (\u201cNAV\u201d) per Share (or Its Equivalent),\u201d certain of the Company\u2019s investments have been valued using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient and are therefore not classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in these tables for the Company\u2019s investments are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the reconciliation of changes in the plan\u2019s benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets above.\nThe fair values of the assets of the Company-sponsored qualified pension plan fall within the following levels of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2020:\n(a) Fixed income securities are comprised of corporate bonds (71%), government bonds (19%), government agency securities (1%) and other fixed income securities (9%).\nThe fair values of the assets of the Company-sponsored qualified pension plan fall within the following levels of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2019:\n(b) Fixed income securities are comprised of corporate bonds (72%), government bonds, (17%) government agency securities (1%) and other fixed income securities (10%).\nThe estimated future pension benefit payments are:\nThe Company was party to a multi-employer pension plan in Ohio from which it has stated its intention to withdraw. As of December 31, 2020, the total estimated liability to withdraw from the plan is $2,992. The current liability associated with the Company\u2019s withdrawal from the multi-employer pension plan of $240 is included in accrued and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the long-term liability of $2,752 is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nPostretirement Plan\nThe Company also provides declining value life insurance to its retirees and a maximum of three years of medical coverage to qualified individuals who retire between the ages of 62 and 65. The Company does not fund these benefits in advance, and uses a December 31 measurement date.\nComponents of net periodic postretirement plan benefit were as follows:\nThe Company expects amortization of prior service credit of $2 and amortization of actuarial loss of $54 the next fiscal year.\nThe status of the postretirement plan was as follows:\nThe assumed health care cost trend rates for medical plans were as follows:\nA 1% increase in the health care cost trend rate assumptions would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2020 by $55 with no significant impact on the annual periodic postretirement benefit cost. A 1% decrease in the health care cost trend rate assumptions would have decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2020 by $51 with no significant impact on the annual periodic postretirement benefit cost.\nThe weighted average discount rate used to determine the net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were as follows:\nRetirement Savings Plans\nThe Company\u2019s retirement savings plan for U.S. employees includes features under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company provides a 401(k) matching contribution of 100% of each dollar on eligible employee contributions up to the first 3% of the employee\u2019s pre-tax compensation, and an additional 50% of each dollar on eligible employee contributions up to the next 2% of the employee\u2019s pre-tax compensation. Each year, in addition to the employer matching contribution, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive\nOfficer may approve a discretionary Company contribution up to 4% of eligible employee\u2019s annual pre-tax compensation. The discretionary contribution is provided as an identical percentage of each employee\u2019s annual pre-tax compensation, regardless of their individual contributions to the 401(k) program. Company contributions cliff vest after two years of employment. There was no discretionary contribution made in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe amounts expensed by the Company relating to its 401(k) plan and other international retirement plans were $1,468 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $1,672 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(8) Income Taxes\nThe components of (loss) income before income taxes were as follows:\nThe income taxes benefit consisted of the following components:\nThe items accounting for differences between the income tax benefit computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision for income taxes were as follows:\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. federal corporate income tax statutory rate is 21%.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, which features several tax provisions and other measures that assist businesses impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The significant tax provisions include an increase in the limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense from 30% to 50% of adjusted earnings in 2019 and 2020, a five-year carryback allowance for net operating losses (\"NOLs\") generated in tax years 2018-2020, increased charitable contribution limitations to 25% of taxable income in 2020, and a retroactive technical correction to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that makes qualified improvement property placed in service after December 31, 2017 eligible for bonus depreciation. The Company has recorded a $1,134 million income tax benefit related to the NOL carryback provisions of the CARES Act for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs a U.S. shareholder, the Company is subject to tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had no tax expense related to GILTI.\nA deferred tax asset of $281 at December 31, 2020 and $1,086 at December 31, 2019 associated with the temporary difference between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of the Convertible Notes\u2019 conversion feature at each balance sheet date was reclassified from a liability to additional paid-in capital on December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively (see Note 5 - Stockholders\u2019 Equity).\nSignificant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $24,306 of federal NOL carryforwards, of which $22,391 carry forward for an indefinite period. The remaining $1,915 of federal NOL carryforwards are limited by IRC Section 382 due to the ownership change in 2017 resulting from the Company\u2019s restructuring through its chapter 11 cases. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $47,174 of state NOL carryforwards which will begin expiring in 2022. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $35,406 of foreign NOL carryforwards, of which a significant portion carry forward for an indefinite period.\nThe Company continues to maintain valuation allowances against substantially all U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts that are realizable either through future reversals of\nexisting taxable temporary differences or through taxable income in carryback years for the applicable jurisdictions.\nActivity in the Company\u2019s valuation allowances for the U.S. and non-U.S. operations were as follows:\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S, state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related income tax assets and liabilities. The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more-likely-than-not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not criterion, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to review by domestic and foreign taxing authorities, including the IRS. In general, the Company is no longer subject to audit by the IRS for tax years through 2012 and state, local or foreign taxing authorities for tax years through 2011.\nRemittances from subsidiaries held by the Company made in 2020 and future years are generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax. These remittances are either excluded from taxable income in the United States as earnings that are already subject to taxation or are subject to a 100% dividends received deduction. There are no other differences which would require the Company to record a material deferred tax liability.\n(9) Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\nFrom time to time, the Company is party to a variety of legal proceedings, claims, and inquiries, including proceedings or inquiries by governmental authorities, which arise from the operation of its business. These proceedings, claims, and inquiries are incidental to and occur in the normal course of the Company\u2019s business affairs. The majority of these proceedings, claims, and inquiries relate to commercial disputes with customers, suppliers, and others; employment and employee benefits-related disputes; product quality disputes with vendors and/or customers; and environmental, health and safety claims. Although the outcome of these proceedings is inherently difficult to predict, management believes that the amount of any judgment, settlement or other outcome of these proceedings, claims and inquiries, after taking into account recorded accruals and the availability and limits of our insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n(10) Segment Reporting\nThe Company has only one reportable segment, Metals. The Company\u2019s marketing strategy focuses on distributing highly engineered specialty grades and alloys of metals as well as providing specialized processing services designed to meet very precise specifications. Core products include alloy, aluminum, stainless steel, nickel, carbon and titanium. Inventories of these products assume many forms such as plate, sheet, extrusions, round bar, hexagon bar, square and flat bar, tubing and coil. Depending on the size of the facility and the nature of the markets it serves, service centers are equipped as needed with bar saws, plate saws, oxygen and plasma arc flame cutting machinery, trepanning machinery, boring machinery, honing equipment, water-jet cutting equipment, stress relieving and annealing furnaces, surface grinding equipment, CNC machinery and sheet shearing equipment. The Company also performs various specialized fabrications for its customers through pre-qualified subcontractors that thermally process, turn, polish, cut-to-length and straighten alloy and carbon bar.\nThe Company operates primarily in North America. Net sales are attributed to countries based on the location of the Company\u2019s subsidiary that is selling direct to the customer and exclude assessed taxes such as sales and excise tax. Company-wide geographic data is as follows:\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of A.M. Castle & Co.\nOak Brook, Illinois\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of A.M. Castle & Co. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders\u2019 deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related consolidated notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nExchange Offer - Refer to Notes 2, 3, and 5 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nIn March 2020, the Company completed the Exchange Offer and issued $95.1 million in aggregate principal amount of new convertible senior secured notes due 2024 (the \u201cNew Notes\u201d) and 70.3 million shares of its common stock in exchange for $190.2 million in aggregate principal amount of its existing convertible senior\nsecured notes due 2022 (the \u201cExisting Notes\u201d). The New Notes are convertible into common stock at the option of the holder (\u201cEmbedded Conversion Feature\u201d). Upon issuance of the New Notes, the Company accounted for the Embedded Conversion Feature as a bifurcated embedded derivative, which was initially recorded at fair value of $39.0 million, with a corresponding reduction in the carrying value to the New Notes. On June 30, 2020, the Company authorized a sufficient number of shares to allow the conversion option to be share-settled in full. As a result, the Company concluded that the Embedded Conversion Feature now qualified for equity classification and the bifurcated derivative liability no longer needed to be accounted for as a separate derivative. The fair value of the conversion option of $37.0 million was reclassified into equity as of June 30, 2020.\nWe identified the accounting for the Exchange Offer, the subsequent reclassification of the bifurcated embedded derivative into equity, and the valuation of the Embedded Conversion Feature to be a critical audit matter given (a) the complexity of applying the accounting framework for the Exchange Offer, including the determination of whether any features of the New Notes should be accounted for as a separate derivative liability, and (b) the significant estimates involved in determining the fair value of the embedded conversion option. The embedded derivative liability was classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and was valued by management using a binomial lattice model using assumptions including the risk-free interest rate, the implied credit spread, expected volatility, and a review of prices for similar debt instruments that do not contain a conversion feature. The complexities and significant estimates required a high degree of auditor judgement and an increased extent of audit effort, including the involvement of professionals in our firm with expertise in the accounting for financial instruments and fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management\u2019s judgements of the accounting treatment for the Exchange Offer and the related conversion feature, as well as the determination of fair value of the embedded conversion option included the following, among others:\n\u25cf We evaluated the underlying agreements associated with the Exchange Offer and agreed the terms of the agreements to the related accounting and valuation analyses.\n\u25cf With the assistance of professionals in our firm with expertise in the accounting for financial instruments, we assessed management\u2019s judgments of the accounting treatment of the Exchange Offer, in particular determining whether any features of the New Notes should be accounted for separately as a derivative liability.\n\u25cf With the assistance of fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology and significant valuation assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the conversion option by:\no Testing the source information underlying the fair value of the conversion option and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.\nAssessing and analyzing the reasonableness and acceptability of the valuation assumptions, including the implied credit spread and expected volatility, and compared them with assumptions used by other market participants.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nMarch 4, 2021\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2002.",

Based upon that review and evaluation, the CEO and CAO have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020.\n(a) Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 rule 240.13a-15(f). The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company\u2019s CEO and CAO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nInternal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even effective internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to the financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company, under the direction of its CEO and CAO, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based upon the framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, referred to as the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013).\nBased on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), the Company\u2019s management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\n(b) Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in internal control over financial reporting in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.",

In considering whether to recommend persons to be nominated for directors, the Governance Committee will apply the criteria set forth in the Company\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines, which include but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nBusiness experience;\n\u2022\nIntegrity;\n\u2022\nAbsence of conflict or potential conflict of interest;\n\u2022\nAbility to make independent analytical inquiries;\n\u2022\nUnderstanding of the Company\u2019s business environment; and\n\u2022\nWillingness to devote adequate time to Board duties.\nWhile the Company\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines do not prescribe specific diversity standards, they do provide that the Board will seek a diversified membership for the Board as a whole, in terms of both the personal characteristics of individuals involved and their various experiences and areas of expertise. When identifying and evaluating candidates, the Governance Committee, as a matter of practice, also considers whether there are any evolving needs of the Board that require experience in a particular field and may consider additional factors it deems appropriate. The Governance Committee does not assign specific weights to any particular criterion and no particular criterion is necessarily applicable to all prospective nominees. The Governance Committee also conducts regular reviews of current directors who may be proposed for re-election and their past contributions to the Board.\nUnder the Company\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines, no director may be nominated for re-election following his or her 72nd birthday. On the recommendation of the Governance Committee, the Board may waive this requirement as to any director if it deems a waiver to be in the best interest of the Company.\nThe Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on the Company\u2019s website.\nDirector Resignation Policy\nIn an uncontested election (i.e., an election where the number of nominees is not greater than the number of directors to be elected), any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes \u201cwithheld\u201d from his or her election than votes \u201cfor\u201d such election (a \u201cMajority Withheld Vote\u201d) shall promptly tender his or her resignation following certification of the stockholder vote. The Governance Committee shall promptly consider the resignation offer and make a recommendation to the Board. The Board will act on the Governance Committee\u2019s recommendation within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote. Any director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the Governance Committee recommendation or Board action regarding whether to accept the resignation offer. However, if each member of the Governance Committee receives a Majority Withheld Vote at the same election, then all non-employee directors on the Board who did not receive a Majority Withheld Vote shall appoint a committee amongst themselves to consider the resignation offers and recommend to the Board whether to accept them.\nDirector Qualifications and Experience\nBelow is certain biographical and other information regarding directors, which is based upon statements made or confirmed to the Company by or on behalf of these individuals, except to the extent certain information appears in the Company\u2019s records.

Mr. Sheehan, a non-employee independent director, has served as Chairperson of the Board since January 2020. Mr. Segal, also a non-employee independent director, has served as Lead Independent Director since November 2017. In his role as Lead Independent Director, Mr. Segal presides over meetings of the full Board and executive sessions in the absence of the Chairperson and, prior to Mr. Sheehan\u2019s appointment as Chairperson, Mr. Segal presided over executive sessions of the independent directors.\nWith the recent exception of Mr. Scheinkman\u2019s role as Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson of the Board, the Company has historically separated these roles. Upon Mr. Scheinkman\u2019s retirement as Chief Executive Officer and his resignation from the Chairperson role in January 2020, the Board again separated these roles and appointed Mr. Sheehan as Chairperson and Mr. Edgar as Chief Executive Officer. Doing so allows Mr. Edgar to focus on strategic business and growth initiatives, while allowing the Chairperson to lead the Board in its fundamental role of providing advice to, and independent oversight of, management.\nThe Chairperson of the Board:\n\u2022\nProvides strategic leadership and guidance;\n\u2022\nEstablishes the agendas for Board meetings, with advice from executive and senior management teams;\n\u2022\nAdvises and consults with the executive and senior management teams regarding strategies, risks, opportunities, and other matters; and\n\u2022\nPresides over meetings of the full Board.\nWhile the Board believes the Company\u2019s leadership model provides appropriate oversight and an effective governance structure, it recognizes that, depending on the circumstances, other leadership models might be appropriate. Accordingly, the Board periodically reviews its leadership structure.\nStanding Board Committees\nThe Board has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Governance Committee and the Human Resources Committee. Each committee has a written charter adopted by the Board, copies of which are posted under the \u201cCorporate Governance\u201d section of the Company\u2019s website at https://castlemetals.com/investors/corporate-governance.\nEach Committee reviews the appropriateness of its charter and performs a self-evaluation at least annually. The Board will review the composition of each committee in light of any changes to the Board\u2019s composition whether as a result of the annual meeting of stockholders each year or otherwise.\nThe following summarizes the responsibilities of each of the Company\u2019s three standing Board committees:\nAudit Committee\nThe Company\u2019s Audit Committee reviews the Company\u2019s audited financial statements with management; reviews the qualifications, performance and independence of the Company\u2019s independent registered public accountants; approves audit fees and fees for the preparation of the Company\u2019s tax returns; reviews the Company\u2019s accounting policies and internal control procedures; and considers and appoints the Company\u2019s independent registered public accountants. The Audit Committee has the authority to engage the services of independent outside experts and advisors as it deems necessary or appropriate to carry out its duties and responsibilities.\nThe Audit Committee oversees the annual risk management assessments, monitors reports received on the Company\u2019s incident reporting hotline, oversees the Company\u2019s compliance program, including an annual review of the Company\u2019s Code of Conduct, and prepares the \u201cReport of the Audit Committee\u201d for its stockholders.\nGovernance Committee\nThe Company\u2019s Governance Committee oversees all corporate governance matters, including acting as an independent committee evaluating transactions between the Company and directors and officers of the Company; reviewing governance policies and practices; reviewing governance-related legal and regulatory matters that could impact the Company; reviewing and making recommendations on the overall size and composition of the Board and its committees; overseeing Board recruitment, including identification of potential director candidates, evaluating candidates, and recommending nominees for membership to the full Board; and leading the annual self-evaluation of the Board and its committees. The Governance Committee has the authority to engage the services of outside consultants and advisors as it deems necessary or appropriate to carry out its duties and responsibilities.\nHuman Resources\nCommittee\nThe Company\u2019s Human Resources Committee assists the Board in the discharge of its responsibilities with respect to employee and non-employee director compensation, including the adoption, periodic review and oversight of the Company\u2019s compensation strategy, policies and plans. The Human Resources Committee approves and administers the incentive compensation and equity-based plans of the Company. The Human Resources Committee has the authority to engage the services of independent outside experts and advisors as it deems necessary or appropriate to carry out its duties and responsibilities.\nDirector Independence; Financial Expert\nWhile the Company\u2019s stock has been trading on the OTCQX market, which requires the Company to establish and maintain fundamental corporate governance standards, the Company has elected to adopt more exacting governance standards that are substantially similar to the NASDAQ listing standards. The Board has affirmatively determined that each current Board member, except for Messrs. Scheinkman and Edgar, is \u201cindependent\u201d within the definitions contained in the current NASDAQ listing standards and the standards set by the Board in the Company\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines. Furthermore, the Board has determined that all members of the Company\u2019s Audit Committee meet the financial sophistication requirements of the NASDAQ listing standards. The Board has determined that Mr. Brodsky qualifies as an \u201caudit committee financial expert\u201d for purposes of the SEC rules.\nBoard Meetings and Attendance\nDuring 2020, the Board held 14 meetings. The Board\u2019s non-employee directors met in regularly scheduled executive sessions to evaluate the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and to discuss other corporate matters. Mr. Sheehan, presided as the Chairperson of the Board at all of the meetings of the Board. Additionally, during 2020, there were five meetings of the Audit Committee, three meetings of the Governance Committee, and two meetings of the Human Resources Committee. Each of the directors attended 75% or more of all the meetings of the Board and the Committees on which he served.\nEach director is expected to attend our annual meetings of stockholders. All directors who were nominated for election or reelection at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders attended that meeting.\nNon-Employee Director Compensation\nCash Compensation\nThe Company\u2019s director compensation program provides that the cash compensation paid to, or earned by, its non-employee directors will be comprised of the following components (in whole numbers):\nEquity-Based Compensation\nNo equity-based compensation was paid to the Company\u2019s non-employee directors in 2020.\nOther Compensation\nReimbursement is made for travel and accommodation expenses incurred to attend meetings and participate in other corporate functions and for the cost of attending one director continuing education program annually. For each director, the Company pays and maintains coverage for personal excess liability, business travel and accident, and director and officer liability insurance policies.\nDirector Compensation Table - Fiscal Year 2020\nThe following table summarizes the compensation paid to or earned by the non-employee directors for 2020. Any employee of the Company who serves as a director receive no additional compensation for service as a director (in whole numbers).\nOversight of Risk Management\nThe Board is actively involved in oversight of risks that could affect the Company. The Board implements its risk oversight function as a whole and through delegation to committees, which meet regularly and report back to the full Board. The risk management role of each of the committees is detailed further below:\nThe full Board retains responsibility for general oversight of risks. Key risks to the Company\u2019s business strategy are considered by the Board as part of the Company\u2019s annual strategy review. See Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the risks faced by the Company.\nCode of Conduct\nThe Board has adopted a Code of Conduct for Directors and a Code of Conduct for Officers. A copy of each Code of Conduct policy can be found on the \u201cCorporate Governance\u201d section of the Company\u2019s website at https://castlemetals.com/investors/corporate-governance.\nEvery director and officer is required to read and follow the Code that is applicable to his or her role. Any waiver of either Code of Conduct requires the approval of the Governance Committee, and must be promptly disclosed to the Company\u2019s stockholders and the public. The Company intends to disclose on the \u201cCorporate Governance\u201d section of its website any material amendments to, or waivers from, the Code of Conduct.",
    "item_11": "Item 11 - Executive Compensation\nIn this section, the Company describes its compensation programs and policies and the material elements of compensation for the year ended December 31, 2020, for its Chief Executive Officer, the principal executive officer (\u201cPEO\u201d), and its two most highly compensated executive officers (other than the PEO) serving as executive officers at the end of 2020 whose total compensation was in excess of $100,000. The Company refers to all individuals whose executive compensation is disclosed in this section as its Named Executive Officers (collectively, the \u201cNamed Executive Officers\u201d).\nCompensation Consultant\nThe Human Resources Committee has periodically engaged Willis Towers Watson (\u201cWillis\u201d) to consult regarding executive officer and director compensation. The Human Resources Committee conducted an independence review in 2020 regarding its engagement of Willis and concluded that Willis is independent.\nThe Company\u2019s compensation consultant provides advice to the Human Resources Committee on an as-request basis as follows:\n\u2022\nReviews the Company's executive compensation program designs and levels, including the mix of total compensation elements, compared to industry peer groups and broader market practices.\n\u2022\nProvides information on emerging trends and legislative developments in executive compensation and implications for the Company.\n\u2022\nReviews the Company's executive stock ownership guidelines, compared to industry peer groups and broader market practices.\n\u2022\nReviews the Company's director compensation program compared to industry peer groups and broader market practices.\nSummary Compensation Table\nThe table below includes the total compensation paid to or earned by each of the Named Executive Officers for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019 (in whole numbers).\nAll Other Compensation Table - Fiscal Year 2020\nThe table below provides additional information about the amounts that appear in the \u201cAll Other Compensation\u201d column in the Summary Compensation Table above (in whole numbers):\nName\nNote\nAward\n401(k) Plan\nCompany\nDeferred Plan\nCompany\nHousing\nReimbursement\nMiscellaneous\nTotal All Other\nCompensation\nElements of Compensation\nThe Company has three elements of total direct compensation: base salary, annual incentives, and long-term incentives, which are described in the following table. The Company also provides the Named Executive Officers with limited perquisites and standard retirement and benefit plans (see the sections below entitled \u201cRetirement Benefits\u201d and \u201cPerquisites and Other Personal Benefits\u201d).\nBase Salary\nWith the exception of the CEO, whose compensation was reviewed and recommended by the Human Resources Committee and approved by the independent members of the Board, the Human Resources Committee reviewed and approved the base salaries of the Named Executive Officers in 2020. In each case, the Human Resources Committee took into account the CEO\u2019s recommendation, as well as experience, internal equity, the performance of each Named Executive Officer during the year, and external competitive compensation data, among other factors. Fixed compensation recognizes individual performance, seniority, scope of responsibilities, leadership skills, experience, and succession planning considerations.\nAnnual Incentives\nAnnual incentives are awarded under the Company\u2019s Short-Term Incentive Program (\u201cSTIP\u201d) and are subject to the terms of the A. M. Castle & Co. 2017 Management Incentive Plan (\u201cMIP\u201d). The purpose of the STIP is to provide variable compensation based on Company performance against annually established key operational and financial measures, as well as individual performance. Metrics and targets under the STIP are evaluated each year for alignment with business strategy.\nSTIP and One-Time Award Payouts\nFor each of the 2020 STIP and the 2019 STIP, the Board approved a plan for the Named Executive Officers that focused on management\u2019s performance in relation to the Company\u2019s operating plan for the fiscal year, as approved and revised throughout the year, with key achievement criteria to include, among other things, top-line revenue performance, margin expansion, growth in highly-accretive product lines and value-added services, improved cash generation and working capital management, and overall EBITDA performance.\nThe Named Executive Officers did not receive any payouts from the 2020 STIP plan as a result of the Company\u2019s overall performance in 2020.\nBased on the Company\u2019s overall performance in 2019, the Human Resources Committee and full Board exercised their discretion, in accordance with the STIP plan, to award 2019 STIP payouts at approximately 50% of target, subject to discretionary adjustments.\nIn 2019 the Human Resources Committee and full Board exercised its discretion under the MIP, to make one-time discretionary cash incentive awards to management in light of sustained and material improvements in the Company\u2019s working capital management beginning in late 2018 and continuing into 2019.\n2017 Management Incentive Plan\nAt the Company\u2019s emergence from restructuring proceedings on August 31, 2017, the MIP became effective. The Human Resources Committee administers the MIP and has broad authority under the MIP, among other things, to: (i) select participants; (ii) determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the MIP, of any award granted under the MIP; (iii) determine the number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to be covered by each award granted under the MIP; and (iv) to determine the fair market value of awards granted under the MIP. Persons eligible to receive awards under the MIP include officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The types of awards that may be granted under the MIP include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units, performance shares, and other forms of cash or stock based awards.\nThe Company grants long-term incentive awards under the MIP to the Named Executive Officers to reward performance over a multi-year time period. Equity-based compensation remains an important component of the Company\u2019s overall compensation strategy to align the interests of the Named Executive Officers with the interests of its stockholders and serves as an important tool for the Company with respect to attracting and retaining executive talent.\nRetirement Benefits\nThe following retirement plans are generally available to all non-union, salaried employees, including the Named Executive Officers:\n\u2022\nSalaried Pension Plan. The Company maintains the Salaried Employees Pension Plan (the \u201cSalaried Pension Plan\u201d), a qualified, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering eligible salaried employees who meet certain age and service requirements. As of June 30, 2008, the benefits under the Salaried Pension Plan were frozen. There are no enhanced pension formulas or benefits available to the Named Executive Officers. Of the current Named Executive Officers, only Mr. Anderson is eligible to receive benefits under the Salaried Pension Plan.\n\u2022\n401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan. The Company maintains the 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan (the \u201c401(k) Plan\u201d), a qualified defined contribution plan, for its employees in the United States who work full-time. There are no enhanced 401(k) benefits available to the Named Executive Officers. Refer to the \u201cAll Other Compensation Table\u201d above for the Company\u2019s contributions to each Named Executive Officer under the 401(k) Plan.\nThe Company also maintains the following plan that is available to a limited number of senior management employees, including the Named Executive Officers:\n\u2022\nSupplemental 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan. The Company maintains an unfunded, nonqualified, deferred compensation plan, the Supplemental 401(k) Plan (the \u201cSupplemental 401(k) Plan\u201d), for its executive officers and senior management. The Supplemental 401(k) Plan has investment options that mirror the Company\u2019s 401(k) Plan and provide participants with the ability to save for retirement with additional tax-deferred funds that otherwise would have been limited due to IRS compensation and benefit limitations. Refer to the \u201cAll Other Compensation Table\u201d above for the Company\u2019s contributions to each participating Named Executive Officer under the Supplemental 401(k) Plan.\nPerquisites and Other Personal Benefits\nThe Company provides the following limited perquisites to the Named Executive Officers: automobile usage or stipends; phone allowances; personal excess liability coverage policy; reimbursement of spousal travel expenses on Company business in certain limited instances; and medical, dental, life insurance, short-term, and long-term disability coverage (standard benefits available to most of its employees).\nEmployment-Related Agreements\nTo assure stability and continuity of management, the Company has entered into Amended and Restated Employment Agreements with each of the Named Executive Officers (each, an \u201cEmployment Agreement\u201d). Mr. Edgar\u2019s Employment Agreement, previously dated as of December 14, 2018 in connection with his appointment to the office of President, was subsequently amended and restated on January 7, 2020 in connection with his appointment to the office of President and CEO effective as of January 1, 2020. Mr. Anderson\u2019s Employment Agreement was entered into on May 15, 2017. Mr. Zundel\u2019s Employment Agreement was entered into on December 14, 2018.\nExecutive Compensation Philosophy\nEach year, the Human Resources Committee reviews and approves the Company's overall Compensation Philosophy and Strategy. Pay for performance is an essential element of the Company's executive compensation philosophy. The Company\u2019s executive compensation programs are designed so that a significant portion of an executive\u2019s compensation is dependent upon the performance of the Company. Measures of financial performance for short-term and long-term incentive programs, and the use of equity, are intended to align compensation with the creation of stockholder value. Target and maximum performance goals under incentive programs are selected so as to generate target or maximum payouts, commensurate with performance, respectively.\nThese programs are designed to provide a total compensation opportunity for the Named Executive Officers that is competitive with the total compensation opportunity offered to executives with similar responsibilities at comparable companies, also known as the \u201cmarket median guideline.\u201d Actual compensation will differ from the targeted opportunity based on actual Company performance. Total compensation is the aggregate of the following categories: (i) base salary; (ii) short-term incentive compensation; and (iii) long-term incentive compensation. In reviewing the Named Executive Officers\u2019 target total cash compensation and total direct compensation opportunities, the Human Resources Committee generally uses the fiftieth percentile of the competitive market data (\u201cmarket median,\u201d as described below) as a guideline. Other factors considered by the Human Resources Committee in setting each Named Executive Officer\u2019s opportunity are experience, internal equity (rational linkage between job responsibilities and total compensation opportunities across all jobs within the Company), individual executive performance, and the alignment between Company performance and executive pay.\nExecutive Compensation Process\nOversight of the Executive Compensation Programs\nThe Human Resources Committee oversees the Company\u2019s executive compensation programs, operating under a charter that is reviewed annually and approved by the Board. All members of the Human Resources Committee are required to be independent under the NASDAQ listing standards definitions of \u201cIndependence\u201d. The Human Resources Committee seeks the assistance of an executive compensation consultant, who is engaged periodically and is also independent of the Company and management.\nProcess for the CEO\nEarly each year, the Board meets in executive session with the CEO to discuss the CEO's prior year performance, and to identify tentative goals for the upcoming year.\nAs with the process for the other Named Executive Officers, the Human Resources Committee considers individual performance, Company performance, and the analysis of its compensation consultant, as requested, when setting the CEO\u2019s compensation. The Human Resources Committee develops recommendations for CEO compensation for the upcoming year for consideration by the Board.\nThe Board meets annually, without the CEO present, to consider the recommendations of the Human Resources Committee, determine any compensation adjustments applicable to the CEO, and finalize the CEO's goals and objectives for the upcoming year. The independent members of the Board then meet with the CEO.\nProcess for Executives other than the CEO\nThe Company utilizes a formal performance management process to establish goals for its executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, and to evaluate management performance. The Human Resources Committee annually reviews the performance of the executive officers with the CEO and the CEO\u2019s recommendation for any changes in the executive officers\u2019 compensation.\nThe CEO's performance review of the executive officers addresses each executive's performance relative to established financial and personal objectives and specific project assignments, and includes a review of the following leadership competencies:\n\u2022\nStrategic leadership;\n\u2022\nDriving execution;\n\u2022\nCross-functional alignment and collaboration;\n\u2022\nDecision making;\n\u2022\nTalent management;\n\u2022\nEngaging and influencing others; and\n\u2022\nBusiness, financial, and other relevant subject matter acumen.\nIn addition to the reviews of individual executive performance, the Human Resources Committee takes into account the overall performance of the Company (as related to the short term and long term incentive plans), as well as the analysis and findings of its executive compensation consultant, as requested, regarding market pay levels and practices.\nThe Human Resources Committee also reviews and approves the material terms of any employment, severance, and change-in-control agreements with the Named Executive Officers, with a view to approving terms that are competitive in the marketplace and that serve to attract, motivate and retain executives.\nBenchmarking\nIn order to establish the market median guideline, the Human Resources Committee reviews competitive market compensation data periodically, including industry compensation data provided by its executive compensation consultant as requested. In 2020 and 2019, the Human Resources Committee\u2019s executive compensation consultant assembled market pay data from published executive compensation surveys including Willis Towers Watson 2017 CBD Executive Compensation Survey, Willis Towers Watson 2017 CSR Executive Compensation Survey and Mercer 2017 MBD Executive Compensation Survey. The survey data was scoped to reflect practices of organizations in the manufacturing industry and were regressed to reflect the Company\u2019s annual revenue.\nAdditional Executive Compensation Information and Policies\nSeverance and Change in Control Benefits\nIn order to attract and retain an appropriate caliber of talent, the Company provides the Named Executive Officers with severance and change in control protections pursuant to the terms of their Employment Agreements.\nIn the event a Named Executive Officer\u2019s employment with the Company terminates for any reason, he will be entitled to certain unpaid and accrued payments and benefits. However, if the Named Executive Officer\u2019s employment is terminated by the Company for \u201cgood cause\u201d or if the Named Executive Officer terminates his employment without \u201cgood reason\u201d, then he will be entitled only to limited payments and benefits consisting primarily of earned but unpaid salary and those benefits as required by applicable law or the terms of the Company\u2019s benefit programs.\nIn the event of termination of Named Executive Officer\u2019s employment with the Company at the end of the initial term of his Employment Agreement or any renewal term, and if such termination is solely due to non-renewal of the Employment Agreement by the Company, then the Named Executive Officer will receive (i) all salary earned but not yet paid through the date of termination and (ii) (x) any prior-year STIP compensation earned\nbut not yet paid and the prorated portion of any current year STIP compensation, and (y) any and all options, rights or awards granted to the Named Executive Officer under the MIP prior to the termination date, that will vest on a prorated basis to reflect the portion of the applicable vesting period lapsed as of the date of termination. In the event of termination of the Employment Agreement due to non-renewal of the Employment Agreement by the Named Executive Officer, then the Named Executive Officer is entitled only to the salary earned but not yet paid through the date of termination.\nIn the event of termination of the Named Executive Officer\u2019s employment by the Company due to his death or permanent disability, the Named Executive Officer or his beneficiaries will be entitled to (i) any compensation owed to the Named Executive Officer through the date of his death or determination of permanent disability (including salary), (ii) any prior-year STIP compensation earned but not yet paid, plus the prorated portion of any current year STIP compensation and (iii) pro-rata vesting of each of his then outstanding and non-vested options, rights or awards under any of the Company\u2019s incentive compensation plans. The Company will provide medical insurance and other benefits to the Named Executive Officer and his dependents, as applicable, for ninety (90) days following his death or determination of permanent disability.\nIf the Named Executive Officer\u2019s employment is terminated by the Named Executive Officer without \u201cgood reason\u201d upon thirty (30) days\u2019 prior written notice to the Company, then the Named Executive Officer is entitled to payment of compensation and all other benefits through the date of termination; provided, however, that if the Company waives the required notice period and terminates his employment early, the Named Executive Officer will be entitled to payment of compensation and all other benefits that he would have been entitled to during such thirty-day notice period.\nIf the Named Executive Officer\u2019s employment is terminated either involuntarily by the Company and not due to \u201cgood cause\u201d or by the Named Executive Officer for \u201cgood reason\u201d, then, in addition to payment of compensation and benefits earned through the date of termination, the Named Executive Officer will be entitled to (i) a cash severance amount, which shall be equal to a \u201cseverance multiple\u201d of the sum of his base salary and the amount of his target STIP in the year the termination occurs; (ii) the prorated portion of any current year STIP; (iii) pro-rata vesting of each of his then outstanding and non-vested options, rights or awards under any of the Company\u2019s incentive compensation plans; (iv) a monthly cash reimbursement for a period of time following termination for the portion of the Named Executive Officer\u2019s cost of COBRA premiums that are in excess of the active-employee cost of such coverage; and (v) the benefit of the auto allowance, mobile telephone allowance and other perquisites for one (1) year following termination. The \u201cseverance multiple\u201d for Mr. Edgar is two times (2x) the sum of his base salary and the amount of his target STIP in the year the termination occurs; the \u201cseverance multiple\u201d for Messrs. Anderson and Zundel is one and one-half times (1.5x) the sum of his base salary and the amount of his target STIP in the year the termination occurs. The period of COBRA premium reimbursement is two (2) years for Mr. Edgar and one and one-half (1.5) year for Messrs. Anderson and Zundel.\nThe Employment Agreements provide for compensation due to termination of employment following a change in control. A \u201cchange in control\u201d will be generally defined to include the acquisition of 40% or more of the Company\u2019s voting power, specified changes in a majority of the Board, and the sale or liquidation of the Company. If the Named Executive Officer\u2019s employment is terminated in connection with a change in control either involuntarily by the Company and not due to \u201cgood cause\u201d or by the Named Executive Officer for \u201cgood reason\u201d, then, in addition to payment of compensation and benefits earned through the date of termination, the Named Executive Officer will receive (i) a \u201cseverance multiple\u201d of the sum of his base salary and the amount of his target STIP in the year the termination occurs; (ii) the prorated portion of any current year STIP; (iii) pro-rata vesting of each of his then outstanding and non-vested options, rights or awards under any of the Company\u2019s incentive compensation plans; (iv) a monthly cash reimbursement for a period of time following termination for the portion of the Named Executive Officer\u2019s cost of COBRA premiums that are in excess of the active-employee cost of such coverage; and (v) the benefit of the auto allowance, mobile telephone allowance and other perquisites for one (1) year following termination. The Named Executive Officer will be eligible to receive any remaining ungranted and unallocated portion of the MIP the Board is required to award in the event of a change in control, subject to the Board\u2019s sole discretion to determine the recipients thereof and the allocation to such recipients. The change in control \u201cseverance multiple\u201d for Mr. Edgar is two and one-half times (2.5x) the sum of his base salary and the amount of his target STIP in the year the termination occurs; the change in\ncontrol \u201cseverance multiple\u201d for Messrs. Anderson and Zundel is two times (2x) the sum of his base salary and the amount of his target STIP in the year the termination occurs. The period of COBRA premium reimbursement after a change in control is two and one-half (2.5) years for Mr. Edgar and two (2) years for Messrs. Anderson and Zundel.\nCompensation Recovery Policy\nThe Company has adopted a compensation recovery (or \u201cclawback\u201d) policy that requires paid incentive compensation to be recovered by the Company to the extent such compensation would have been lower due to restated financial results. The Human Resources Committee has the authority to calculate the amount of any overpayment and, in its sole discretion, to seek to recover amounts determined to have been inappropriately received by any current or former executive of the Company. The clawback policy provides that overpayments of compensation should be recovered within twelve months after an applicable restatement of financial results.\nAnti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy\nUnder the Company\u2019s Insider Trading Policy, directors, executive officers and employees are prohibited from (i) hedging the economic interest in the Company\u2019s securities, and (ii) purchasing securities on margin, holding Company securities in a margin account, or pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at 2020 Fiscal Year-End\nThe following table sets forth information on the holdings of stock options and stock awards by the Named Executive Officers as of December 31, 2020.",

The Original ABL Credit Agreement provided for a $125.0 million senior secured, revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving A Credit Facility\u201d), under which the Company and four of its subsidiaries each are borrowers. On June 1, 2018, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 1 to Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (\u201cAmendment No. 1\u201d) by and among the Company, the other borrowers and guarantors party thereto and PNC as the agent and the lenders, which amended the ABL Credit Agreement to provide for additional borrowing capacity under a Revolving B credit facility (the \u201cRevolving B Credit Facility\u201d), which is subordinated to the Revolving A Credit Facility.
