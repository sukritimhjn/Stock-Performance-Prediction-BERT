    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nCompany Overview\nCanadian Pacific Railway Limited (\u201cCPRL\u201d), together with its subsidiaries (\u201cCP\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), owns and operates a transcontinental freight railway in Canada and the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d). CP provides rail and intermodal transportation services over a network of approximately 13,000 miles, directly serving the principal business centres of Canada from Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, to Vancouver, British Columbia (\"B.C.\"), and the U.S. Northeast and Midwest regions. CP\u2019s railway network feeds directly into the U.S. heartland from the East and West coasts. Agreements with other carriers extend the Company's market reach in Canada, through the U.S. and into Mexico. CP transports bulk commodities, merchandise freight and intermodal traffic. For additional information regarding CP's network and geographical locations, refer to Item 2. Properties.\nCPRL was incorporated on June 22, 2001, under the Canada Business Corporations Act and controls and owns all of the Common Shares of Canadian Pacific Railway Company (\u201cCPRC\u201d), which was incorporated in 1881 by Letters Patent pursuant to an Act of the Parliament of Canada. CPRL's registered, executive and corporate head office is located at 7550 Ogden Dale Road S.E., Calgary, Alberta T2C 4X9. CPRL's Common Shares (the \"Common Shares\") are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (\u201cTSX\u201d) and the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) under the symbol \u201cCP\u201d.\nFor purposes of this annual report, all references herein to \u201cCP\u201d, \u201cthe Company\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d and \u201cus\u201d refer to CPRL, CPRL and its subsidiaries, CPRL and one or more of its subsidiaries, or one or more of CPRL's subsidiaries, as the context may require. All references to currency amounts included in this annual report, including the Consolidated Financial Statements, are in Canadian dollars unless specifically noted otherwise.\nStrategy\nCP is continuing the journey to become the best railway in North America, with a culture of responsibility and accountability focused on five key foundations:\n\u2022Provide Service: Providing efficient and consistent transportation solutions for the Company\u2019s customers. \u201cDoing what we say we are going to do\u201d is what drives CP in providing a reliable product with a lower cost operating model. Centralized planning aligned with local execution is bringing the Company closer to the customer and accelerating decision-making.\n\u2022Control Costs: Controlling and removing unnecessary costs from the organization, eliminating bureaucracy and continuing to identify productivity enhancements are the keys to success.\n\u2022Optimize Assets: Through longer and heavier trains, and improved asset utilization, the Company is moving increased volumes with fewer locomotives and cars while unlocking capacity for future growth potential.\n\u2022Operate Safely: Each year, CP safely moves millions of carloads of freight across North America while ensuring the safety of our people and the communities through which we operate. Safety is never to be compromised. CP strives for continuous implementation of state-of-the-art safety technology, safety management systems, and safety culture with our employees to ensure safe, efficient operations across our network.\n\u2022Develop People: CP recognizes that none of the other foundations can be achieved without its people. Every CP employee is a railroader and the Company has established a culture focused on our values of accountability, diversity and pride, in everything we do. Coaching and mentoring all employees into becoming leaders will continue to drive CP forward.\nStarting in 2012, CP transformed its operations by investing in the network and executing a precision scheduled railroading model that lowers costs, optimizes assets, and provides better, more competitive service.\nToday, we continue to apply our long-term strategy: leverage our lower cost base, network strengths and improved service to drive sustainable, profitable growth. While the accomplishments during the turnaround were tremendous, CP\u2019s journey to become North America\u2019s best-performing rail carrier is far from over. As a Company, we will remain focused on our next level of service, productivity, and innovation to continue to generate sustainable value for our customers and results for our shareholders.\nBusiness Developments\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer demand resulted in lower volumes in the following lines of business: Energy, chemicals and plastics, Metals, minerals and consumer products, and Automotive.\nAs COVID-19 continued to spread throughout Canada and the United States during 2020, CP conducted business as usual, to the greatest extent possible in the circumstances, while continuing to apply the principles of precision scheduled railroading to respond to changes in demand. The Company is continuing to take a variety of measures to ensure the availability of its transportation services throughout our network, promote the safety and security of our\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 4\nemployees, and support the communities in which we operate. Certain modifications the Company has made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic include but are not limited to: implementing periods of working at home for certain office employees; restricting employee business travel; implementing post-travel employee screening; strengthening clean workplace practices; reinforcing socially responsible sick leave recommendations; limiting visitor and third-party access to Company facilities; launching internal COVID-19 resources for employees; creating a pandemic response team comprised of employees and members of senior management; and encouraging telephonic and video conference-based meetings along with other hygiene and social distancing practices recommended by health authorities including Health Canada, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization. CP supported employees by working with labour unions to shorten recall times to be prepared for demand increases while supplementing employment insurance payments and maintaining health benefit coverage for employees during that period. CP also awarded a bonus for our frontline employees who worked or were laid off in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CP is responding to this crisis through measures designed to protect our workforce and prevent disruptions to the central role the Company's operations provide to the North American economy. CP's service is deemed essential as part of the transportation industry. We believe that we remain well positioned to adjust to market conditions to assist our customers as they work to manage their supply chain and inventories.\nPreventative measures that serve to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID-19 remain in effect, including modifying our workspace to implement physical distancing measures, and continuously reevaluating our efforts with safety as a top priority.\nIn addition to the above, we have also observed many other companies, including companies in our industry, taking precautionary and preemptive actions to address the COVID-19 pandemic, and companies may take further actions that alter their normal business operations. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that could materially alter our business operations as may be required or recommended by federal, provincial, state or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, shareholders, partners, suppliers, and other stakeholders.\nAdditional information concerning the impact COVID-19 may have to our future business and results of operations is provided in Part I,",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively, \"forward-looking statements\").\nThe information set forth in this Item 1A. Risk Factors should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this annual report, including Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nBusiness Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect the Company's business and operating results. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer demand resulted in lower volumes in several of the Company's lines of business, including Energy, chemicals and plastics, Metals, minerals and consumer products, and Automotive. The future impacts of COVID-19 on the Company's business or operating and financial results are unpredictable and cannot be identified or assessed with certainty at this time. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the global economy and resulted in a widespread economic downturn which has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact demand for our services and otherwise cause interruptions, including fluctuations to commodity prices, disruptions or restrictions on the ability to transport freight in the ordinary course, temporary closures of facilities and ports, or the facilities and ports of our customers, partners, suppliers or other third-party service providers, and/or changes to export/import restrictions. The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has impacted and may continue to impact the seasonal trends that typically characterize our revenues and operating income. There is no assurance that the outbreak will not continue to have a material and adverse impact on our business or results of operations. Additionally, our operations could be further negatively affected if a significant number of our employees are unable to perform their normal duties, including because of contracting COVID-19 or based on further direction from governments, public health authorities or regulatory agencies. The extent of the impact, if any, will depend on developments, many of which are beyond our control, including actions taken by governments, financial institutions, monetary policy authorities, and public health authorities to contain and respond to public health concerns and general economic conditions as a result of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic may also result in continued substantial market volatility and declines, which could adversely impact future net periodic benefit costs and funding requirements of CP\u2019s pension plans. Furthermore, certain impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including demand for our services and to economic conditions generally, could continue following the pandemic or the expiration or termination of government actions in respect of the pandemic.\nWe will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required or recommended by federal, provincial, state or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, shareholders and other stakeholders. We cannot be certain of potential effects that any such alterations or modifications may have on our business or operating and financial results in future fiscal periods.\nTo the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business or operating and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described above and below.\nAs a common carrier, the Company is required by law to transport dangerous goods and hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims. Railways, including CP, are legally required to transport dangerous goods and hazardous materials as part of their common carrier obligations regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss. CP transports dangerous goods and hazardous materials, including but not limited to crude oil, ethanol and TIH materials such as chlorine gas and anhydrous ammonia. A train accident involving hazardous materials could result in significant claims against CP arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed the existing insurance coverage commercially available to CP, which could have a material adverse effect on CP\u2019s financial condition, operating results, and liquidity. CP is also required to comply with rules and regulations regarding the handling of dangerous goods and hazardous materials in Canada and the U.S. Noncompliance with these rules and regulations can subject the Company to significant penalties and could factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Changes to these rules and regulations could also increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiencies and impact service delivery.\nThe Company is subject to significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial, operating and environmental matters. The Company\u2019s railway operations are subject to extensive federal laws, regulations and rules in both Canada and the U.S. Operations are subject to economic and safety regulations in Canada primarily by the Agency and TC. The Company\u2019s U.S. operations are subject to economic and safety regulation by the STB and the FRA. Various other regulators directly and indirectly affect the Company\u2019s operations in areas such as health, safety, security, environmental and other matters. Additional economic regulation of the rail industry by these regulators or the Canadian and U.S. federal and state or provincial legislative bodies, whether under new or existing laws, could have a significant negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to determine prices for rail services and result in a material adverse effect in the future on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity in a particular year or quarter. This potential material adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on the Company\u2019s rail network or in abandonment of lines.\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 22\nThe Company\u2019s compliance with safety and security regulations may result in increased capital expenditures and operating costs. For example, compliance with the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 has resulted in additional capital expenditures associated with the statutorily mandated implementation of PTC. In addition to increased capital expenditures, implementation of such regulations may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels, as well as increased operating expenses.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws concerning, among other matters, emissions to the air, land and water and the handling of hazardous materials and wastes. Violation of these laws and regulations can result in significant fines and penalties, as well as other potential impacts on CP\u2019s operations. These laws can impose strict, and in some circumstances, joint and several liability on both current and former owners, and on operators of facilities. Such environmental liabilities may also be raised by adjacent landowners or third parties. In addition, in operating a railway, it is possible that releases of hazardous materials during derailments or other accidents may occur that could cause harm to human health or to the environment. Costs of remediation, damages and changes in regulations could materially affect the Company\u2019s operating results and reputation. The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations. The Company currently has obligations at existing sites for investigation, remediation and monitoring, and will likely have obligations at other sites in the future. The actual costs associated with both current and long-term liabilities may vary from the Company\u2019s estimates due to a number of factors including, but not limited to changes in: the content or interpretation of environmental laws and regulations; required remedial actions; technology associated with site investigation or remediation; and the involvement and financial viability of other parties that may be responsible for portions of those liabilities.\nThe Company faces competition from other transportation providers and failure to compete effectively could adversely affect financial results. The Company faces significant competition for freight transportation in Canada and the U.S., including competition from other railways, motor carriers, ship and barge operators, and pipelines. Competition is based mainly on quality of service, freight rates and access to markets. Other transportation modes generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by government entities, while CP and other railways must use internal resources to build and maintain their rail networks. Competition with the trucking industry is generally based on freight rates, flexibility of service and transit time performance. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation that eliminates or significantly reduces the burden of the size or weight limitations currently applicable to trucking carriers, could have a material adverse effect on CP's financial results.\nThe operations of carriers with which the Company interchanges may adversely affect operations. The Company's ability to provide rail services to customers in Canada and the U.S. also depends upon its ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to, among other matters, revenue division, car supply and locomotive availability, data exchange and communications, reciprocal switching, interchange, and trackage rights. Deterioration in the operations or services provided by connecting carriers, or in the Company's relationship with those connecting carriers, could result in CP's inability to meet customers' demands or require the Company to use alternate train routes, which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe Company may be subject to litigation and other claims that could result in significant expenditures. By nature of its operations, the Company is exposed to potential for litigation and other claims, including personal injury claims, labour and employment disputes, commercial and contract disputes, environmental liability, freight claims and property damage claims. Accruals are made in accordance with applicable accounting standards and based on an ongoing assessment of the likelihood of success of the claim together with an evaluation of the damages or other monetary relief sought. Material changes to litigation trends, a catastrophic rail incident or series of incidents involving freight loss, property damage, personal injury, environmental liability, or other claims, and other significant matters could have a material adverse impact to the Company's results of operations, financial position and liquidity, in each case, to the extent not covered by insurance.\nThe Company may be affected by acts of terrorism, war, or risk of war. CP plays a critical role in the North American transportation system and therefore could become the target for acts of terrorism or war. CP is also involved in the transportation of hazardous materials, which could result in CP's equipment or infrastructure being direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks. Acts of terrorism, or other similar events, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption to CP and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nSevere weather or natural disasters could result in significant business interruptions and costs to the Company. CP is exposed to severe weather conditions and natural disasters including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, avalanches, mudslides, extreme temperatures and significant precipitation that may cause business interruptions that can adversely affect the Company\u2019s entire rail network. This could result in increased costs, increased liabilities and decreased revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of services, the Company may not be able to restore services without a significant interruption in operations.\n23 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nHuman Capital Risks\nThe availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect the Company's operations. Changes in employee demographics, training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel, particularly locomotive engineers and trainpersons, could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to meet demand for rail services. Unpredictable increases in the demand for rail services may increase the risk of having insufficient numbers of trained personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, changes in operations and other technology improvements may significantly impact the number of employees required to meet the demand for rail services.\nStrikes or work stoppages could adversely affect the Company's operations. Class I railways are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labour unions. The majority of CP's employees belong to labour unions and are subject to these agreements. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or the Company's potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts, which could cause a significant disruption of the Company's operations and have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, future national labour agreements, or provisions of labour agreements related to health care, could significantly increase the Company's costs for health and welfare benefits, which could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and liquidity.\nVolatility Risks\nThe Company may be affected by fluctuating fuel prices. Fuel expense constitutes a significant portion of the Company\u2019s operating costs. Fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations, and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. The Company currently employs a fuel cost adjustment program to help reduce volatility in changing fuel prices, but the Company cannot be certain that it will always be able to fully mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through this program. Factors affecting fuel prices include worldwide oil demand, international politics, weather, refinery capacity, supplier and upstream outages, unplanned infrastructure failures, environmental and sustainability policies, and labour and political instability.\nTechnology Risks\nThe Company relies on technology and technological improvements to operate its business. Information technology is critical to all aspects of CP\u2019s business. If the Company were to experience a significant disruption or failure of one or more of its information technology or communications systems (either as a result of an intentional cyber or malicious act, or an unintentional error) it could result in service interruptions or other failures, misappropriation of confidential information and deficiencies, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. If CP is unable to acquire or implement new technology, the Company may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nSupply Chain Risks\nDisruptions within the supply chain could negatively affect the Company's operational efficiencies and increase costs. The North American transportation system is integrated. CP\u2019s operations and service may be negatively impacted by service disruptions of other transportation links, such as ports, handling facilities, customer facilities and other railways. A prolonged service disruption at one of these entities could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nThe Company is dependent on certain key suppliers of core railway equipment and materials that could result in increased price volatility or significant shortages of materials, which could adversely affect results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Due to the complexity and specialized nature of core railway equipment and infrastructure (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail and ties), there can be a limited number of suppliers of rail equipment and materials available. Should these specialized suppliers cease production or experience capacity or supply shortages, this concentration of suppliers could result in CP experiencing cost increases or difficulty in obtaining rail equipment and materials, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, CP\u2019s operations are dependent on the availability of diesel fuel. A significant fuel supply shortage arising from production decreases, increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets, disruption of oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position and liquidity in a particular year or quarter.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nGlobal Risks\nGlobal economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight transported by the Company. A decline or disruption in domestic, cross border or global economic conditions that affect the supply or demand for the commodities that CP transports may decrease CP\u2019s freight volumes and may result in a material adverse effect on CP\u2019s financial or operating results and liquidity. Economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a significant impact on CP's financial position, results of operations, and liquidity in a particular year or quarter.\nThe Company may be directly and indirectly affected by the impacts of global climate change. There is potential for significant impacts to CP\u2019s business and rail infrastructure due to changes in global climate conditions. Increasing frequency, intensity and duration of extreme weather events such as\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 24\nflooding, storms and forest fires may result in substantial costs to respond during the event, to recover from the event and possibly to modify existing or implementing new infrastructure to prevent recurrence. The Company is currently subject to emerging regulatory programs that place a price on carbon emissions associated with railway operations in Canada. Government bodies at the provincial and federal level are imposing carbon taxation systems and cap and trade market mechanisms in the Canadian jurisdictions in which CP operates. As a significant consumer of diesel fuel, an escalating price on carbon emissions will lead to a corresponding increase of the Company\u2019s business costs. Programs that place a price on carbon emissions or other government restrictions on certain market sectors may further impact current and potential customers including thermal coal, petroleum crude oil and renewable fuel sectors. Introduction of, or changes to, regulations by government bodies in response to these anticipated impacts could result in a significant increase in expenses and could adversely affect our business performance, results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nLiquidity Risks\nThe state of capital markets could adversely affect the Company's liquidity. Weakness in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company\u2019s access to capital. From time to time, the Company relies on the capital markets to provide some of its capital requirements, including the issuance of long-term debt instruments and commercial paper. Significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets and the credit markets, or deterioration of the Company's financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate the Company's access to, and/or significantly increase the cost of, various financing sources, including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of the Company's financial condition, alone or in combination, could also result in a reduction in the Company's credit rating to below investment grade, which could also further prohibit or restrict the Company from accessing external sources of short-term and long-term debt financing, and/or significantly increase the associated costs.",

    "item_2": "ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nNetwork Geography\nThe Company\u2019s network in Canada extends from the Port of Vancouver on Canada\u2019s Pacific Coast to the Port of Montr\u00e9al and eastern Qu\u00e9bec up into the Port of Saint John, New Brunswick via haulage, and to the U.S. industrial centres of Chicago, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; Buffalo and Albany, New York; Kansas City, Missouri; and Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nThe Company\u2019s network is composed of three primary corridors: Western, Central and Eastern.\nThe Western Corridor: Vancouver to Thunder Bay\nOverview - The Western Corridor links Vancouver with Thunder Bay, which is the Western Canadian terminus of the Company\u2019s Eastern Corridor. With service through Calgary, the Western Corridor is an important part of the Company\u2019s routes between Vancouver and the U.S. Midwest, and between Vancouver and eastern Canada. The Western Corridor provides access to the Port of Thunder Bay, Canada\u2019s primary Great Lakes bulk terminal.\nProducts - The Western Corridor is the Company\u2019s primary route for bulk and resource products traffic from western Canada to the Port of Vancouver for export. CP also handles significant volumes of international intermodal containers and domestic general merchandise traffic.\nFeeder Lines - CP supports its Western Corridor with four significant feeder lines: the \u201cCoal Route\u201d, which links southeastern B.C. coal deposits to the Western Corridor and to coal terminals at the Port of Vancouver; the \u201cEdmonton-Calgary Route\u201d, which provides rail access to Alberta\u2019s Industrial Heartland (north of Edmonton, Alberta) in addition to the petrochemical facilities in central Alberta; the \u201cPacific CanAm Route\u201d, which connects Calgary and Medicine Hat in Alberta with Pacific Northwest rail routes at Kingsgate, B.C. via the Crowsnest Pass in Alberta; and the \u201cNorth Main Line Route\u201d that provides rail service to customers between Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, and Wetaskiwin, Alberta, including intermediate stations at Yorkton and Saskatoon in Saskatchewan. This line is an important collector of Canadian grain and fertilizer, serving the potash mines located east and west of Saskatoon and many high-throughput grain elevators and processing facilities. In addition, this line provides direct access to refining and upgrading facilities at Lloydminster, Alberta, and western Canada\u2019s largest pipeline terminal at Hardisty, Alberta.\nConnections - The Company\u2019s Western Corridor connects with the Union Pacific Railroad (\u201cUP\u201d) at Kingsgate and with Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (\"BNSF\") at Coutts, Alberta, and at New Westminster and Huntingdon in B.C.

The Company has locomotive and railcar repair facilities at Golden in B.C., Vancouver, Calgary, Moose Jaw and Winnipeg. CP also has major intermodal terminals at Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Regina and Winnipeg.\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 26\nThe Central Corridor: Moose Jaw and Winnipeg to Chicago and Kansas City\nOverview - The Central Corridor connects with the Western Corridor at Moose Jaw and Winnipeg. By running south to Chicago and Kansas City, through the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, and through Milwaukee, Wisconsin, CP provides a direct, single-carrier route between western Canada and the U.S. Midwest, providing access to Great Lakes and Mississippi River ports. From La Crosse, Wisconsin, the Central Corridor continues south towards Kansas City via the Quad Cities (Davenport and Bettendorf in Iowa, and Rock Island and Moline in Illinois), providing an efficient route for traffic destined for southern U.S. and Mexican markets. CP\u2019s Kansas City line also has a direct connection into Chicago and by extension to points east on CP\u2019s network such as Toronto, Ontario and the Port of Montr\u00e9al in Qu\u00e9bec.\nProducts - Traffic transported on the Central Corridor includes intermodal containers from the Port of Vancouver, fertilizers, chemicals, crude, frac sand, Automotive, and Grain and other agricultural products.\nFeeder Lines - The Company has operating rights over BNSF tracks between Minneapolis and St. Paul along with connectivity to the twin ports of Duluth, Minnesota and Superior, Wisconsin. CP maintains its own yard facilities that provide an outlet for grain from the U.S. Midwest to the grain terminals at these ports. This is a strategic entry point for large dimensional shipments that can be routed via CP's network to locations such as Alberta's Industrial Heartland to serve the needs of the oil sands and energy industry. CP's route from Winona, Minnesota, to Tracy, Minnesota, provides access to key agricultural and industrial commodities. CP\u2019s feeder line between Drake and New Town in North Dakota is geographically situated in a highly strategic region for Bakken oil production. CP also owns two significant feeder lines in North Dakota and western Minnesota operated by the Dakota Missouri Valley and Western Railroad and the Northern Plains Railroad, respectively. Both of these short lines are also active in providing service to agricultural and Bakken-oil-related customers.\nConnections - The Company\u2019s Central Corridor connects with all major railways at Chicago. Outside of Chicago, CP has major connections with BNSF at Minneapolis, Minot, North Dakota, and the Duluth-Superior Terminal and with UP at St. Paul and Mankato, Minnesota. CP connects with CN at Milwaukee and Chicago. At Kansas City, CP connects with Kansas City Southern (\u201cKCS\u201d), BNSF, Norfolk Southern Railway (\"NS\") and UP. CP\u2019s Central Corridor also links to several short-line railways that primarily serve grain and coal producing areas in the U.S., and extend CP\u2019s market reach in the rich agricultural areas of the U.S. Midwest. A haulage arrangement with Genesee & Wyoming Inc., provides Intermodal service to Jeffersonville, Ohio.\nYards and Repair Facilities - The Company supports rail operations on the Central Corridor with main rail yards in Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Glenwood in Minnesota, and Mason City and Davenport in Iowa. In addition, CP has a major locomotive repair facility at St. Paul and car repair facilities at St. Paul and Chicago. CP shares a yard with KCS in Kansas City. CP owns 49% of the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad, a switching railway serving Greater Chicago and northwest Indiana. CP is also part owner of the Belt Railway Company of Chicago, which is the largest intermediate switching terminal railroad in the U.S. CP has major intermodal terminals in Minneapolis and Chicago as well as a dried distillers' grains transload facility that complements the service offering in Chicago.\nThe Eastern Corridor: Thunder Bay to Eastern Qu\u00e9bec, Detroit and Albany\nOverview - The Eastern Corridor extends from Thunder Bay through to the Port of Montr\u00e9al, Searsport, Maine and the Port of Saint John, via haulage agreement, and from Toronto to Chicago via Detroit or Buffalo. The Company\u2019s Eastern Corridor provides shippers direct rail service from Toronto, Montr\u00e9al, and Saint John to Calgary and Vancouver via the Company\u2019s Western Corridor and to the U.S. via the Central Corridor. This is a key element of the Company\u2019s transcontinental intermodal service. The corridor also supports the Company\u2019s market position at the Port of Montr\u00e9al by providing one of the shortest rail routes for European cargo destined to the U.S. Midwest, using the CP-owned route between Montr\u00e9al and Detroit, coupled with a trackage rights arrangement on NS tracks between Detroit and Chicago or the CP-owned route between Montr\u00e9al and Buffalo coupled with a haulage arrangement on CSX Corporation (\u201cCSX\u201d) tracks between Buffalo and Chicago. CP\u2019s 2019 acquisition of CMQ Canada and the 2020 acquisition of CMQ U.S. extends access through southern and eastern Qu\u00e9bec to Saint John, New Brunswick and the U.S. Northeast including Searsport, Maine. In 2020, CP acquired full ownership of the DRTP. The 1.6-mile tunnel linking Windsor and Detroit will continue to be operated by CP.\nProducts - Major traffic categories transported in the Eastern Corridor include Forest products, chemicals and plastics, crude, ethanol, Metals, minerals and consumer products, Intermodal, automotive products and general merchandise.\nFeeder Lines - A major feeder line serves the steel industry at Hamilton, Ontario and provides connections with both CSX and NS at Buffalo. The Delaware & Hudson Railway Company, Inc.

CP also connects in New York with the two eastern Class I railways; NS and CSX at Buffalo, NS at Schenectady and CSX at Albany.\n27 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nYards and Repair Facilities - CP supports its rail operations in the Eastern Corridor with major rail yards at Sudbury, Toronto, London and Montr\u00e9al. The Company has locomotive repair facilities at Montr\u00e9al and Toronto and car repair facilities at Thunder Bay, Toronto and Montr\u00e9al. The Company\u2019s largest intermodal facility is located in the northern Toronto suburb of Vaughan and serves the Greater Toronto and southwestern Ontario areas. CP also operates intermodal terminals at Montr\u00e9al and Detroit. CP also has transload facilities in Agincourt, Milton, and Hamilton, Ontario and in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec to meet a variety of commodity needs in these areas.\nRight-of-Way\nThe Company\u2019s rail network is standard gauge, which is used by all major railways in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. Continuous welded rail is used on the core main line rail network.\nCP uses different train control systems on portions of the Company\u2019s owned track, depending on the volume of rail traffic. Remotely controlled centralized traffic control signals are used in various corridors to authorize the movement of trains. CP has implemented PTC on 2,117 miles of its U.S. network.\nIn other corridors, train movements are directed by written instructions transmitted electronically and by radio from rail traffic controllers to train crews. In some specific areas of intermediate traffic density, CP uses an automatic block signalling system in conjunction with written instructions from rail traffic controllers.\nNetwork Investment\nThe Company continually assesses its network to ensure appropriate capacity to meet market demand. As part of CP's annual capital program, the Company has made substantial investments to support current and future volumes, including upgrading the network to handle longer and heavier trains, such as extending sidings to accommodate new train lengths. The Company\u2019s operating metrics, such as average train speed, length, and weight, demonstrate efficient utilization of network capacity, discussed in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Performance Indicators.\nTrack and Infrastructure\nCP operates on a network of approximately 13,000 miles of track, of which 2,300 miles CP accesses under trackage rights. The Company's owned track miles include leases with wholly owned subsidiaries where the term of the lease exceeds 99 years. CP's track network represents the size of the Company's operations that connects markets, customers and other railways. Of the total mileage operated, approximately 5,400 miles are located in western Canada, 2,500 miles in eastern Canada (including CMQ Canada), 4,500 miles in the U.S. Midwest and 700 miles in the U.S. Northeast. CP\u2019s network accesses the U.S. markets directly through four wholly owned subsidiaries: Soo Line Railroad Company (\u201cSoo Line\u201d), a Class I railway operating in the U.S. Midwest; the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad (\"DM&E\"), which operates in the U.S. Midwest; the D&H, which operates between eastern Canada and the U.S. Northeast; and the CMQ U.S., which operates in the U.S. Northeast.\nAt December 31, 2020, the breakdown of CP operated track miles is as follows:\nRail Facilities\nCP operates numerous facilities including: terminals for intermodal, transload, automotive and other freight; classification rail yards for train-building and switching, storage-in-transit and other activities; offices to administer and manage operations; dispatch centres to direct traffic on the rail network; crew quarters to house train crews along the rail line; shops and other facilities for fuelling; maintenance and repairs of locomotives; and facilities for maintenance of freight cars and other equipment. The Company continues to invest in terminal upgrades and new facilities to accommodate incremental growth in volumes, such as creating additional capacity with the redesign of the classification yard at Alyth in Calgary. The Company\u2019s average terminal dwell is an indicator of efficient utilization of yard capacity, discussed in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Performance Indicators. Typically in all of our major yards, CP Police Services has offices to ensure the safety and security of the yards and operations.\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 28\nThe following table includes the major yards, terminals and transload facilities on CP's network:\nEquipment\nCP's equipment includes: owned and leased locomotives and railcars; heavy maintenance equipment and machinery; other equipment and tools in our shops, offices and facilities; and vehicles for maintenance, transportation of crews, and other activities.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and other information in this annual report. Except where otherwise indicated, all financial information reflected herein is expressed in Canadian dollars.\nExecutive Summary\n2020 Results\n\u2022Financial performance - In 2020, CP reported Diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") of $17.97, a 3% increase from $17.52 in 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS increased to $17.67, a 7% increase compared to $16.44 in 2019. CP\u2019s commitment to service and operational efficiency produced an Operating ratio of 57.1%. Adjusted diluted EPS is defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures and discussed further in Results of Operations of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\u2022Total revenues - CP\u2019s Total revenues decreased by 1% to $7,710 million in 2020 from $7,792 million in 2019, driven primarily by the unfavourable impact of lower fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices, and lower volumes as measured by revenue ton-miles (\"RTMs\") primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19. This decrease was partially offset by higher liquidated damages, including customer volume commitments, and higher freight rates.\n\u2022Operating performance - Average train weight increased by 6% to 9,707 tons and average train length increased by 7% to 7,929 feet due to improvements in operating plan efficiency, in each case compared to 2019. These metrics are discussed further in Performance Indicators of this Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following table compares 2020 outlook to actual results:\n(1) Adjusted diluted EPS is defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. As described in the 2021 Outlook section below, CP had not calculated an outlook for Diluted EPS in 2020.\nThe updates in RTM growth and Adjusted diluted EPS expectations were based on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer demand in the following lines of business: Energy, chemicals and plastics, Metals, minerals and consumer products, and Automotive. CP revised its outlook quarterly given the evolving nature of impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n2021 Outlook\nWith a 2021 plan that encompasses profitable sustainable growth, CP expects high single-digit RTM growth and double-digit Adjusted diluted EPS growth. CP\u2019s expectations for Adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2021 are based on Adjusted diluted EPS of $17.67 in 2020. For the purposes of this outlook, CP assumes an effective tax rate of 24.6 percent. CP estimates other components of net periodic benefit recovery to increase by approximately $40 million versus 2020. As CP continues to invest in service, productivity and safety, the Company plans to invest approximately $1.55 billion in capital programs in 2021. Capital programs are defined and discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAdjusted diluted EPS is defined and discussed further in Non-GAAP Measures and in Forward-Looking Statements of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Although CP has provided a forward-looking Non-GAAP measure (Adjusted diluted EPS), management is unable to reconcile, without unreasonable efforts, the forward-looking Adjusted diluted EPS to the most comparable GAAP measure, due to unknown variables and uncertainty related to future results. These unknown variables may include unpredictable transactions of significant value. In recent years, CP has recognized changes in income tax rates and a change to an uncertain tax item. These or other similar, large unforeseen transactions affect diluted EPS but may be excluded from CP\u2019s Adjusted diluted EPS. Additionally, the Canadian dollar-to-U.S. exchange rate is unpredictable and can have a significant impact on CP\u2019s reported results but may be excluded from CP\u2019s Adjusted diluted EPS. In particular, CP excludes the foreign exchange (\"FX\")\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 38\nimpact of translating the Company\u2019s debt and lease liabilities from Adjusted diluted EPS. Please see Forward-Looking Statements of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion.\nPerformance Indicators\nThe following table lists the key measures of the Company\u2019s operating performance:\n(1) FRA personal injuries per 200,000 employee-hours for the year ended December 31, 2018, previously reported as 1.48, was restated to 1.47 in this report. This restatement reflects new information available within specified periods stipulated by the FRA but that exceed the Company's financial reporting timeline.\nOperations Performance\nThese key measures are used by management as comparisons to historical operating results and in the planning process to facilitate decisions that continue to drive further productivity improvements in the Company's operations. Results of these key measures reflect how effective CP\u2019s management is at controlling costs and executing the Company\u2019s operating plan and strategy. Continued monitoring of these key measures ensures that the Company can take appropriate actions to ensure the delivery of superior service and be able to grow its business at low incremental cost.\nA GTM is defined as the movement of one ton of train weight over one mile. GTMs are calculated by multiplying total train weight by the distance the train moved. Total train weight comprises the weight of the freight cars, their contents, and any inactive locomotives. An increase in GTMs indicates additional workload. GTMs for 2020 were 272,360 million, a 3% decrease compared with 280,724 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by decreased volumes of crude, Coal, and frac sand. This decrease was partially offset by increased volumes of Grain, Potash, and Fertilizers and sulphur.\nGTMs in 2019 were 280,724 million, a 2% increase compared with 275,362 million in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by increased volumes of Energy, chemicals and plastics and Intermodal. This increase was partially offset by decreased volumes of Potash, frac sand, and Coal.\nTrain miles are defined as the sum of the distance moved by all trains operated on the network. Train miles provide a measure of the productive utilization of our network. A smaller increase in train miles relative to increases in volumes, as measured by RTMs, and/or workload, as measured by GTMs, indicates improved train productivity. Train miles for 2020 were 30,324 thousands, a decrease of 8% compared with 32,924 thousands in 2019. This decrease reflects the impact of a 3% decrease in workload (GTMs), as well as a 6% increase in average train weights.\nTrain miles in 2019 were 32,924, an increase of 2% compared with 32,312 thousands in 2018. This reflects the impact of higher GTMs in 2019.\n39 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nAverage train weight is defined as the average gross weight of CP trains, both loaded and empty. This excludes trains in short-haul service, work trains used to move CP\u2019s track equipment and materials, and the haulage of other railways\u2019 trains on CP\u2019s network. An increase in average train weight indicates improved asset utilization and may also be the result of moving heavier commodities. Average train weight of 9,707 tons in 2020 increased by 578 tons, or 6% compared with 9,129 tons in 2019. This increase was a result of improvements in operating plan efficiency, continued improvements in operational efficiency due to moving longer and heavier export potash and Grain trains, and improved winter operating conditions in the first quarter of 2020. This increase was partially offset by moving lower volumes of heavier commodities such as Canadian coal and crude. Improvements for Grain trains were driven by the High Efficiency Product (\"HEP\") train model, which is an 8,500-foot train model that features the new high-capacity grain hopper cars and increased grain carrying capacity.\nAverage train weight of 9,129 tons in 2019 increased by 29 tons from 9,100 tons in 2018. This slight increase was a result of improvements in operating plan efficiency. This increase was partially offset by the implementation of CP's winter contingency plan in the first quarter of 2019 resulting in shorter and lighter trains within the operating plan.\nAverage train length is defined as the average total length of CP trains, both loaded and empty. This includes all cars and locomotives on the train and is calculated as the sum of each car or locomotive's length multiplied by the distance travelled, divided by train miles. This excludes trains in short-haul service, work trains used to move CP's track equipment and materials, and the haulage of other railroads' trains on CP's network. An increase in average train length indicates improved asset utilization. Average train length of 7,929 feet in 2020 increased by 541 feet, or 7%, compared with 7,388 feet in 2019. This increase was a result of improvements in operating plan efficiency and continued improvements in operational efficiency due to moving longer Grain and export potash trains. This increase was partially offset by moving lower volumes of commodities such as Canadian coal, which move in longer trains. Improvements for Grain trains were driven by the 8,500-foot HEP train model.\nAverage train length of 7,388 feet in 2019 increased by 75 feet, or 1%, from 7,313 feet in 2018. This was a result of improvements in operating plan efficiency and increased Intermodal volumes which move on longer trains. This increase was partially offset by the implementation of CP's winter contingency plan in the first quarter of 2019 resulting in shorter and lighter trains within the operating plan.\nAverage terminal dwell is defined as the average time a freight car resides within terminal boundaries expressed in hours. The timing starts with a train arriving at the terminal, a customer releasing the car to the Company, or a car arriving at interchange from another railroad. The timing ends when the train leaves, a customer receives the car from CP, or the freight car is transferred to another railroad. Freight cars are excluded if they are being stored at the terminal or used in track repairs. A decrease in average terminal dwell indicates improved terminal performance resulting in faster cycle times and improved railcar utilization. Average terminal dwell of 6.5 hours in 2020 increased by 2% from 6.4 hours in 2019. This unfavourable increase was a result of aligning the operating plan to demand in order to maintain network efficiencies in the last three quarters of 2020. Aligning the operating plan to demand resulted in increased average train weight, average train length, and increased locomotive productivity.\nAverage terminal dwell of 6.4 hours in 2019 favourably decreased by 6% from 6.8 hours in 2018. This favourable decrease was due to improved network fluidity.\nAverage train speed is defined as a measure of the line-haul movement from origin to destination including terminal dwell hours. It is calculated by dividing the total train miles travelled by the total train hours operated. This calculation does not include delay time related to customers or foreign railways and excludes the time and distance travelled by: i) trains used in or around CP\u2019s yards; ii) passenger trains; and iii) trains used for repairing track. An increase in average train speed indicates improved on-time performance resulting in improved asset utilization. Average train speed was 22.0 mph in 2020, a decrease of 1%, from 22.2 mph in 2019. This decrease in speed was a result of aligning the operating plan to demand in order to maintain network efficiencies in the last three quarters of 2020, partially offset by improved winter operating conditions in the first quarter of 2020. Aligning the operating plan to demand resulted in increased average train weight, average train length, and increased locomotive productivity.\nAverage train speed in 2019 was 22.2 mph, an increase of 3%, from 21.5 mph in 2018. This increase in speed was due to the completion of network infrastructure projects, partially offset by the impact of harsh winter operating conditions and network disruptions in the first quarter of 2019.\nLocomotive productivity is defined as the daily average GTMs divided by daily average operating horsepower. Operating horsepower excludes units offline, tied up or in storage, or in use on other railways, and includes foreign units online. An increase in locomotive productivity indicates more efficient locomotive utilization and may also be the result of moving heavier commodities. Locomotive productivity was 207 GTMs/OHP in 2020, an increase of 5 GTMs/OHP, or 2%, compared to 202 GTMs/OHP in 2019. This increase was primarily due to improvements in operating plan efficiency as a result of aligning the operating plan to demand.\nLocomotive productivity was 202 GTMs/OHP in 2019, an increase of 4 GTMs/OHP, or 2%, compared to 198 GTMs/OHP in 2018. This increase was primarily due to improvements in operating plan efficiency as a result of aligning the operating plan to demand.\nFuel efficiency is defined as U.S. gallons of locomotive fuel consumed per 1,000 GTMs. Fuel consumed includes gallons from freight, yard and commuter service but excludes fuel used in capital projects and other non-freight activities. An improvement in fuel efficiency indicates operational cost savings and\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 40\nCP's commitment to corporate sustainability through a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions intensity. Fuel efficiency for 2020 was 0.942 U.S. gallons/1,000 GTMs, an improvement of 1% compared to 2019. This improvement was primarily due to improved winter operating conditions in the first quarter of 2020. Fuel efficiency for 2019 of 0.955 U.S. gallons/1,000 GTMs was flat compared to 2018.\nTotal Employees and Workforce\nAn employee is defined as an individual currently engaged in full-time, part-time, or seasonal employment with CP while workforce is defined as total employees plus contractors and consultants. The Company monitors employment and workforce levels in order to efficiently meet service and strategic requirements. The number of employees is a key driver to total compensation and benefits costs.\nThe average number of total employees for 2020 decreased by 935, or 7%, compared with 2019. This decrease was primarily due to more efficient resource planning, including furloughs associated with the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, partially offset by the addition of CMQ employees. The total number of employees as at December 31, 2020 was 11,890, a decrease of 804, or 6%, compared to 12,694 as at December 31, 2019, due to reduced workload as measured in GTMs and more efficient resource planning.\nThe average number of total employees for 2019 increased by 347, or 3%, compared to 2018. This increase was primarily due to growth in workload as measured in GTMs. The total number of employees as at December 31, 2019 was 12,694, a decrease of 146, or 1%, compared to 12,840 as at December 31, 2018, due to more efficient resource planning and reduced workload in the fourth quarter, partially offset by the addition of CMQ Canada employees.\nThe total workforce as at December 31, 2020 was 11,904, a decrease of 828, or 7%, compared to 12,732 as at December 31, 2019, due to more efficient resource planning.\nThe total workforce as at December 31, 2019 was 12,732, a decrease of 134, or 1%, compared to 12,866 as at December 31, 2018, due to more efficient resource planning.\nSafety Indicators\nSafety is a key priority and core strategy for CP\u2019s management, employees, and Board of Directors. Personal injuries and train accidents are indicators of the effectiveness of the Company's safety systems, and are used by management to evaluate and, as necessary, alter the Company's safety systems, procedures, and protocols. Each measure follows U.S Federal Railroad Administration (\"FRA\") reporting guidelines, which can result in restatement after initial publication to reflect new information available within specified periods stipulated by the FRA but that exceed the Company's financial reporting timeline.\nThe FRA personal injuries per 200,000 employee-hours frequency is the number of personal injuries, multiplied by 200,000 and divided by total employee hours. Personal injuries are defined as injuries that require employees to lose time away from work, modify their normal duties or obtain medical treatment beyond minor first aid. FRA employee-hours are the total hours worked, excluding vacation and sick time, by all employees, excluding contractors. The FRA personal injuries per 200,000 employee-hours frequency for CP was 1.11 in 2020, compared with 1.42 in 2019 and 1.47 in 2018.\nThe FRA train accidents per million train-miles frequency is the number of train accidents, multiplied by 1,000,000 and divided by total train miles. Train accidents included in this metric meet or exceed the FRA reporting threshold of U.S. $10,700 in damage. The FRA train accidents per million train-miles frequency for CP was 0.96 in 2020 , compared with 1.06 in 2019 and 1.10 in 2018.\n41 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nResults of Operations\nIncome\nOperating income was $3,311 million in 2020, an increase of $187 million, or 6%, from $3,124 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to:\n\u2022liquidated damages, including customer volume commitments, and higher freight rates;\n\u2022the efficiencies generated from improved operating performance and asset utilization;\n\u2022a gain of $68 million as a result of the remeasurement to fair value of the previously held equity investment in the Detroit River Tunnel Partnership (\"DRTP\");\n\u2022the impact of harsher winter operating conditions in 2019; and\n\u2022decreased operating expense associated with lower casualty costs incurred in 2020.\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n\u2022lower volumes as measured by RTMs;\n\u2022higher depreciation and amortization of $71 million (excluding FX);\n\u2022cost inflation; and\n\u2022higher stock-based compensation of $37 million primarily driven by an increase in stock price.\nOperating income was $3,124 million in 2019, an increase of $293 million, or 10%, from $2,831 million in 2018. This increase was primarily due to:\n\u2022higher freight rates;\n\u2022the efficiencies generated from improved operating performance and asset utilization;\n\u2022the favourable impact of change in FX of $39 million; and\n\u2022the favourable impact from changes in fuel prices of $38 million.\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n\u2022increased operating expense associated with higher casualty costs in 2019 of $76 million (excluding FX);\n\u2022higher stock-based compensation of $58 million;\n\u2022cost inflation; and\n\u2022increased weather related costs as a result of harsh winter operating conditions in the first quarter of 2019.\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 42\n*Adjusted income is defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nNet income was $2,444 million in 2020, an increase of $4 million, from $2,440 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to:\n\u2022higher Operating income;\n\u2022a deferred tax recovery relating to a tax return filing election for the state of North Dakota; and\n\u2022a provision for an uncertain tax item of a prior period in 2019.\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n\u2022an income tax recovery associated with changes in tax rates in 2019;\n\u2022lower FX translation gain on U.S. dollar-denominated debt and lease liabilities compared to 2019; and\n\u2022lower other components of net periodic benefit recovery.\nNet income was $2,440 million in 2019, an increase of $489 million, or 25%, from $1,951 million in 2018. This increase was primarily due to:\n\u2022higher Operating income;\n\u2022FX translation gains on debt and lease liabilities in 2019 compared to FX translation losses on debt in 2018; and\n\u2022a higher income tax recovery associated with changes in tax rates.\nThis increase was partially offset by higher income taxes due to higher taxable income and a provision for an uncertain tax item of a prior period.\nAdjusted income, defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, was $2,403 million in 2020, an increase of $113 million, or 5%, from $2,290 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher Operating income, partially offset by lower other components of net periodic benefit recovery.\nAdjusted income was $2,290 million in 2019, an increase of $210 million, or 10%, from $2,080 million in 2018. This increase was due to the same factors discussed above for the increase in Net income, except that Adjusted income excludes FX translation gains and losses on debt and lease liabilities, income tax recoveries associated with changes in tax rates, and a provision for an uncertain tax item of a prior period.\n43 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nDiluted Earnings per Share\n*Adjusted diluted EPS is defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nDiluted EPS was $17.97 in 2020, an increase of $0.45, or 3%, from $17.52 in 2019. This increase was due to a lower average number of outstanding Common Shares due to the Company's share repurchase program, and higher Net income.\nDiluted EPS was $17.52 in 2019, an increase of $3.91, or 29%, from $13.61 in 2018. This increase was due to higher Net income and lower average number of outstanding Common Shares due to the Company's share repurchase program.\nAdjusted diluted EPS, defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, was $17.67 in 2020, an increase of $1.23, or 7%, from $16.44 in 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS was $16.44 in 2019, an increase of $1.93, or 13%, from $14.51 in 2018. These increases were due to higher Adjusted income and lower average number of outstanding Common Shares due to the Company's share repurchase program.\nOperating Ratio\nThe Operating ratio provides the percentage of revenues used to operate the railway. A lower percentage normally indicates higher efficiency in the operation of the railway. The Company\u2019s Operating ratio was 57.1% in 2020, a 280 basis point improvement from 59.9% in 2019. This improvement was primarily due to:\n\u2022liquidated damages, including customer volume commitments, and higher freight rates;\n\u2022the favourable impact of changes in fuel prices;\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 44\n\u2022the efficiencies generated from improved operating performance and asset utilization; and\n\u2022a gain as a result of the remeasurement to fair value of the previously held equity investment in DRTP.\nThis improvement was partially offset by:\n\u2022higher depreciation and amortization;\n\u2022cost inflation; and\n\u2022higher stock-based compensation.\nThe Company\u2019s Operating ratio was 59.9% in 2019, a 140 basis point improvement from 61.3% in 2018. This improvement was primarily due to:\n\u2022higher freight rates;\n\u2022the favourable impact of changes in fuel prices; and\n\u2022the efficiencies generated from improved operating performance and asset utilization.\nThis improvement was partially offset by:\n\u2022increased operating expense associated with higher casualty costs in 2019;\n\u2022higher stock-based compensation; and\n\u2022cost inflation.\nReturn on Average Shareholders' Equity and Adjusted Return on Invested Capital\nReturn on average shareholders' equity and Adjusted return on invested capital (\"Adjusted ROIC\") are measures used by management to determine how productively the Company uses its long-term capital investments, representing critical indicators of good operating and investment decisions. Adjusted ROIC is also an important performance criteria in determining certain elements of the Company's long-term incentive plan.\nReturn on average shareholders' equity was 34.0% in 2020, a 160 basis point decrease compared to 35.6% in 2019. This decrease was due to higher average shareholders' equity due to accumulated Net income, partially offset by the impact of the Company's share repurchase program.\nReturn on average shareholders' equity was 35.6% in 2019, a 580 basis point increase compared to 29.8% in 2018. This increase was due to higher Net income. This increase was partially offset by higher average shareholders' equity due to accumulated Net income, partially offset by the impact of the Company's share repurchase program.\nAdjusted ROIC was 16.7% in 2020, a 20 basis point decrease compared to 16.9% in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to higher average long-term debt, partially offset by higher Operating income.\nAdjusted ROIC was 16.9% in 2019, a 70 basis point increase compared to 16.2% in 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher Operating income. This increase was partially offset by the increase in adjusted average invested capital primarily due to higher Adjusted income, partially offset by lower Common Shares due to the Company's share repurchase program.\nAdjusted ROIC is a Non-GAAP measure, which is defined and reconciled from Return on average shareholders' equity, the most comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nImpact of Foreign Exchange on Earnings\nFluctuations in FX affect the Company\u2019s results because U.S. dollar-denominated revenues and expenses are translated into Canadian dollars. U.S. dollar-denominated revenues and expenses increase (decrease) when the Canadian dollar weakens (strengthens) in relation to the U.S. dollar.\nOn February 12, 2021, the noon buying rate certified for customs purposes by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York was U.S. $1.00 = $1.27 Canadian dollars.\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the average exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar expressed in the Canadian dollar equivalent of one U.S. dollar, the period end exchange rates, and the high and low exchange rates for the periods indicated. Average exchange rates are calculated by using the exchange rates on the last day of each full month during the relevant period. These rates are based on the noon buying rate certified for customs purposes by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board.\n45 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nIn 2020, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar resulted in an increase in total revenues of $33 million, an increase in total operating expenses of $23 million and an increase in net interest expense of $4 million. In 2019, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar resulted in an increase in total revenues of $87 million, an increase in total operating expenses of $48 million and an increase in net interest expense of $10 million.\nThe impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar on the Company's results is discussed further in",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Exchange Risk\nAlthough CP conducts business primarily in Canada, a significant portion of its revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities including debt are denominated in U.S. dollars. The value of the Canadian dollar is affected by a number of domestic and international factors, including, without limitation, economic performance, and Canadian, U.S. and international monetary policies. Consequently, the Company\u2019s results are affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between these currencies. In 2021, CP expects that every $0.01 weakening (or strengthening) of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, positively (or negatively) impacts Total revenues by approximately $27 million (2019 - approximately $30 million), negatively (or positively) impacts Operating expenses by approximately $14 million (2019 - approximately $15 million), and negatively (or positively) impacts Net interest expense by approximately $3 million (2019 - approximately $3 million) on an annualized basis.\nCP uses U.S. dollar-denominated debt to hedge its net investment in U.S. operations. As at December 31, 2020, the net investment in U.S. operations is less than the total U.S. denominated debt. Consequently, FX translation on the Company\u2019s undesignated debt and lease liabilities causes additional impacts on earnings in Other income.\nTo manage its exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates between Canadian and U.S. dollars, CP may sell or purchase U.S. dollar forwards at fixed rates in future periods. In addition, changes in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and other currencies (including the U.S. dollar) make the goods transported by the Company more or less competitive in the world marketplace and may in turn positively or negatively affect revenues.\nShare Price Impact on Stock-Based Compensation\nBased on information available at December 31, 2020 and expectations for 2021 grants, for every $1.00 change in share price, stock-based compensation expense has a corresponding change of approximately $0.4 million to $0.6 million (2019 - approximately $0.4 million to $0.6 million). This excludes the impact of changes in share price relative to the S&P/TSX 60 Index, the S&P/TSX Capped Industrial Index, the S&P 1500 Road and Rail Index, and to Class I railways, which may trigger different performance share unit payouts. Stock-based compensation may also be impacted by non-market performance conditions.\nAdditional information concerning stock-based compensation is included in",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d).\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 18, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nProperties - Direct Costs that are Capitalized to Self-constructed Assets - Refer to Notes 1, 12 and 19 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company recognizes direct costs as capitalized additions to self-constructed assets, within properties, based on expenditures necessary to make an asset ready for its intended use. The capitalization of self-constructed assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to the capitalization of direct cost additions to self-constructed assets based on whether the expenditures meet capitalization criteria under US GAAP.\nWe identified the capitalization of direct cost additions to self-constructed assets as a critical audit matter because the judgments and assumptions management makes could have a significant impact on the capitalization of direct cost additions. As such auditing the capitalization of direct cost additions involves a high degree of auditor judgment.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the capitalization of direct cost additions to self-constructed assets included the following, among others:\n\u2022Evaluated the effectiveness of controls over self-constructed assets, including those over the capitalization of direct cost additions to self-constructed assets.\n\u2022Selected a sample of direct costs and obtained evidence to support the capitalized additions to self-constructed assets and assessed whether these expenditures met the capitalization criteria under US GAAP.\n79 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nDefined Benefit Pension - Refer to Notes 1 and 22 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company\u2019s accounting of its defined benefit pension plans involves the measurement of the projected benefit obligation and fair value of fund assets. The measurement of the projected-benefit obligation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the discount rate, which is based on blended market interest rates of high-quality corporate debt instruments with matching cash flows. The measurement of the fair value of fund assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the expected return on fund assets, which is calculated using the market-related value of assets.\nWe identified the determination of the discount rate (for the projected benefit obligation), and the determination of the expected return on fund assets (for the determination of the net period benefit cost) as the critical audit matters because of the significant estimates and assumptions management makes could have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of fund assets. As such auditing the determination of the discount rate and the expected return on fund assets involves a high degree of auditor judgment as the estimates and assumptions made by management contains significant measurement uncertainty and resulted in an increased extent of effort, which included the need to involve an actuarial specialist.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the determination of the discount rate (for the projected benefit obligation), and the expected return on fund assets (for the determination of the fair value of fund assets) included the following, among others:\n\u2022Evaluated the effectiveness of controls over defined benefit pension plans, including those over the determination of the discount rate and the expected return on fund assets.\n\u2022With the assistance of an actuarial specialist, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rate by:\n-Assessing the methodology used in management\u2019s determination of the discount rate,\n-Testing the underlying source information, and\n-Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.\n\u2022With the assistance of an actuarial specialist, we evaluated the reasonableness of the expected return on fund assets by:\n-Assessing the methodology used in management\u2019s determination of the expected return on fund assets,\n-Testing the underlying source information, and\n-Comparing management\u2019s assumptions to historical data and available market trends.\n\u2022Evaluated management\u2019s ability to accurately forecast the discount rate and expected return on fund assets by comparing actual results to management\u2019s historical forecasts.\n/s/ Deloitte LLP\nChartered Professional Accountants\nCalgary, Canada\nFebruary 18, 2021\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2011.\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 80\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n81 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 82\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSee Commitments and contingencies (Note 25).\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nApproved on behalf of the Board:\n/s/ ISABELLE COURVILLE /s/ JANE L.

CP provides rail and intermodal transportation services over a network of approximately 13,000 miles, serving the principal business centres of Canada from Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, to Vancouver, British Columbia, and the U.S. Northeast and Midwest regions. CP\u2019s railway network feeds directly into the U.S. heartland from the East and West coasts. Agreements with other carriers extend the Company\u2019s market reach in Canada, throughout the U.S. and into Mexico. CP transports bulk commodities, merchandise freight and intermodal traffic. Bulk commodities include grain, coal, fertilizers and sulphur. Merchandise freight consists of finished vehicles and automotive parts, as well as forest, industrial and consumer products. Intermodal traffic consists largely of retail goods in overseas containers that can be transported by train, ship and truck, and in domestic containers and trailers that can be moved by train and truck.\n1. Summary of significant accounting policies\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d)\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements are expressed in Canadian dollars and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of CP and all its subsidiaries. The Company\u2019s investments in which it has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method. Distributions received from equity method investees are classified using the nature of the distribution approach for cash flow presentation purposes, whereby distributions received are classified based on the nature of the activity or activities of the investee that generated the distribution as either a return on investment (classified as a cash inflow from operating activities) or a return of investment (classified as a cash inflow from investing activities). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year, the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Management regularly reviews its estimates, including those related to environmental liabilities, pensions and other benefits, depreciable lives of properties, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as legal and personal injury liabilities based upon currently available information. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for providing services. Government imposed taxes that the Company collects concurrent with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. In the normal course of business, the Company does not generate any material revenue through acting as an agent for other entities.\nThe Company provides rail freight transportation services to a wide variety of customers and transports bulk commodities, merchandise freight and intermodal traffic. The Company signs master service agreements with customers that dictate future services the Company is to perform for a customer at the time a bill of lading or service request is received. Each bill of lading or service request represents a separate distinct performance obligation that the Company is obligated to satisfy. The transaction price is generally in the form of a fixed fee determined at the inception of the bill of lading or service request. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation. As each bill of lading or service request represents a separate distinct performance obligation, the estimated standalone selling price is assessed at an observable price which is fair market value. Certain customer agreements include variable consideration in the form of rebates, discounts, or incentives. The expected value method is used to estimate variable consideration and is allocated to the applicable performance obligation and is recognized when the related performance obligation is satisfied. Additionally, the Company offers published rates for services through public tariff agreements in which a customer can request service, triggering a performance obligation the Company must satisfy. Railway freight revenues are recognized over time as services are provided based on the percentage of completed service method. Volume rebates to customers are accrued as a reduction of freight revenues based on estimated volumes and contract terms as freight service is provided. Freight revenues also include certain ancillary and other services provided in association with the performance of rail freight movements. Revenues from these activities are not material and therefore have been aggregated with the freight revenues from customer contracts with which they are associated.\nNon-freight revenues, including revenues earned from passenger service operators, switching fees, and revenues from logistics services, are recognized at the point in time the services are provided or when the performance obligations are satisfied. Non-freight revenues also include leasing revenues.\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 86\nPayment by customers is due upon satisfaction of performance obligations. Payment terms are such that amounts outstanding at the period end are expected to be collected within one reporting period. The Company invoices customers at the time the bill of lading or service request is processed and therefore the Company has no material unbilled receivables and no contract assets. All performance obligations not fully satisfied at period end are expected to be satisfied within the reporting period immediately following. Contracted customer incentives are amortized to income over the term of the related revenue contract.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.\nThe effect of a change in income tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period during which the change occurs.\nWhen appropriate, the Company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, CP considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of CP\u2019s deferred tax assets will not be realized, based on management\u2019s judgment using available evidence about future events.\nAt times, tax benefit claims may be challenged by a tax authority. Tax benefits are recognized only for tax positions that are more likely than not sustainable upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. A liability for \u201cunrecognized tax benefits\u201d is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in CP\u2019s tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards.\nInvestment and other similar tax credits are deferred on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized to \u201cIncome tax expense\u201d as the related asset is recognized in income. Income tax recovery or expense on items in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" are recognized in \"Income tax expense\" as the related item is recognized in income.\nEarnings per share\nBasic earnings per share are calculated using the weighted-average number of the Company's Common Shares (\"Common Shares\") outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated using the treasury stock method for determining the dilutive effect of options.\nForeign currency translation\nAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, other than those held through foreign subsidiaries, are translated into Canadian dollars at the year-end exchange rate for monetary items and at the historical exchange rates for non-monetary items. Foreign currency revenues and expenses are translated at the exchange rates in effect on the dates of the related transactions. Foreign exchange (\"FX\") gains and losses, other than those arising from the translation of the Company\u2019s net investment in foreign subsidiaries, are included in income.\nThe accounts of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries are translated into Canadian dollars using the year-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities and the average exchange rates during the year for revenues, expenses, gains, and losses. FX gains and losses arising from the translation of the foreign subsidiaries\u2019 assets and liabilities are included in \u201cOther comprehensive loss\u201d. A portion of U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt has been designated as a hedge of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries. As a result, unrealized FX gains and losses on U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt, designated as a hedge, are offset against FX gains and losses arising from the translation of foreign subsidiaries\u2019 accounts in \u201cOther comprehensive loss\u201d.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments that are readily convertible to cash with original maturities of three months or less, but excludes cash and cash equivalents subject to restrictions.\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable from customers are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost less allowance for expected credit losses. Losses on accounts receivable are estimated based on historical credit loss experience of receivables with similar risk characteristics. Historical loss experience is adjusted to reflect any management expectations that current or future conditions will differ from conditions that existed for the period over which historical information is evaluated.\nTo determine expected credit losses, receivables are disaggregated by credit characteristics, type of customer service, customer line of business, and receivable aging. Receivables are considered to be in default and are written off against the allowance for credit losses when it is probable that all remaining contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the customer contracts. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to earnings in the period recovered.\n87 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nMaterials and supplies\nMaterials and supplies are carried at the lower of average cost or market value and consist primarily of fuel and parts used in the repair and maintenance of track structures, equipment, locomotives and freight cars.\nProperties\nFixed asset additions and major renewals are recorded at cost, including direct costs, attributable indirect costs and carrying costs, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment. When there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of property, a liability, when reliably estimable, is initially recognized at its fair value and a corresponding asset retirement cost is added to the gross book value of the related asset and amortized to expense over the estimated term to retirement. The Company reviews the carrying amounts of its properties whenever changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amounts may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows. When such properties are determined to be impaired, recorded asset values are revised to their fair value and an impairment loss is recognized.\nThe Company recognizes expenditures as additions to properties or operating expenses based on whether the expenditures increase the output or service capacity, lower the associated operating costs or extend the useful life of the properties and whether the expenditures exceed minimum physical and financial thresholds.\nMuch of the additions to properties, both new and replacement properties, are self-constructed. These are initially recorded at cost, including direct costs and attributable indirect costs, overheads and carrying costs. Direct costs include, among other things, labour costs, purchased services, equipment costs and material costs. Attributable indirect costs and overheads include incremental long-term variable costs resulting from the execution of capital projects. Indirect costs mainly include work trains, material distribution, highway vehicles and work equipment. Overheads primarily include a portion of the engineering department\u2019s costs, which plans, designs and administers these capital projects. These costs are allocated to projects by applying a measure consistent with the nature of the cost, based on cost studies. For replacement properties, the project costs are allocated to dismantling and installation based on cost studies. Dismantling work, which is expensed, is performed concurrently with the installation.\nBallast programs including undercutting, shoulder ballasting and renewal programs that form part of the annual track program are capitalized as this work, and the related added ballast material, significantly improves drainage, which in turn extends the life of ties and other track materials. These costs are tracked separately from the underlying assets and depreciated over the period to the next estimated similar ballast program. Spot replacement of ballast is considered a repair which is expensed as incurred.\nThe costs of large refurbishments are capitalized and locomotive overhauls are expensed as incurred, except where overhauls represent a betterment of the locomotive in which case costs are capitalized.\nThe Company capitalizes development costs for major new computer systems.\nThe Company follows group depreciation, which groups assets which are similar in nature and have similar economic lives. The property groups are depreciated on a straight-line basis reflecting their expected economic lives determined by depreciation studies. Depreciation studies are regular reviews of asset service lives, salvage values, accumulated depreciation and other related factors. Depreciation rates are established through these studies. Actual use and retirement of assets may vary from current estimates, and would be identified in the next study. These changes in expected economic lives would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods. All track assets are depreciated using a straight-line method which recognizes the value of the asset consumed as a percentage of the whole life of the asset.\nWhen depreciable property is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, the book value, less net salvage proceeds, is charged to accumulated depreciation and if different than the assumptions under the depreciation study could potentially result in adjusted depreciation expense over a period of years. However, when removal costs exceed the salvage value on assets and the Company has no legal obligation to remove the assets, the removal costs incurred are charged to income in the period in which the assets are removed and are not charged to accumulated depreciation.\nFor certain asset classes, the historical cost of the asset is separately recorded in the Company\u2019s property records. This amount is retired from the property records upon retirement of the asset. For assets for which the historical cost cannot be separately identified the amount of the gross book value to be retired is estimated using either an indexation methodology, whereby the current replacement cost of the asset is indexed to the estimated year of installation for the asset, or a first-in, first-out approach, or statistical analysis is used to determine the age of the retired asset. CP uses indices that closely correlate to the principal costs of the assets.\nThere are a number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and as it is not possible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired, CP regularly monitors the estimated service lives of assets and the associated accumulated depreciation for each asset class to ensure depreciation rates are appropriate. If the recorded amounts of accumulated depreciation are greater or less than the amounts indicated by the depreciation studies, then the excess or deficit is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable asset classes.\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 88\nFor the sale or retirement of larger groups of depreciable assets that are unusual and were not considered in the Company\u2019s depreciation studies, CP records a gain or loss for the difference between net proceeds and net book value of the assets sold or retired. The accumulated depreciation to be retired includes asset-specific accumulated depreciation, when known, and an appropriate portion of the accumulated depreciation recorded for the relevant asset class as a whole, calculated using a cost-based allocation.\nRevisions to the estimated useful lives and net salvage projections constitute a change in accounting estimate and are addressed prospectively by amending depreciation rates.\nEquipment under finance lease is included in Properties and depreciated over the period of expected use.\nLeases\nThe Company has leases for rolling stock, buildings, vehicles, railway equipment, roadway machines, and information systems hardware. CP has entered into rolling stock and roadway machine leases that are fully variable or contain both fixed and variable components. Variable components are dependent on the hours and miles that the underlying equipment has been used. Fixed term, short-term, and variable operating lease costs are recorded in \"Equipment rents\" and \"Purchased services and other\" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Components of finance lease costs are recorded in \"Depreciation and amortization\" and \"Net interest expense\" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe Company determines lease existence and classification at the lease inception date. Leases are identified when an agreement conveys the right to control identified property for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company recognizes both an operating lease liability and right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) asset for operating leases with fixed terms and in-substance fixed terms. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease payments include fixed and variable payments that are based on an index or a rate. If the Company's leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit interest rate, the Company uses internal incremental secured borrowing rates for comparable tenor in the same currency at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Operating and finance lease ROU assets also include lease prepayments and initial direct costs, but are reduced by lease incentives. The lease term may include periods associated with options to extend or exclude periods associated with options to terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise these options.\nThe Company has short-term operating leases with terms of 12 months or less, some of which include options to purchase that the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise. The Company has elected to apply the recognition exemption and, as such, accounts for leases with a term of 12 months or less off-balance sheet. Therefore, lease payments on these short-term operating leases are not included in operating lease ROU assets and liabilities, but are recognized as an expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Further, the Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components for all leases, except for leases of roadway machines and information systems hardware.\nAssets held for sale\nAssets to be disposed that meet the held for sale criteria are reported in \"Other assets\" at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value, less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.\nGoodwill and intangible assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets upon acquisition of a business. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the business acquisition which, after integration of operations with the railway network, may be different than the acquired business.\nThe carrying value of goodwill, which is not amortized, is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year as at October 1st, or more frequently as economic events dictate. The Company has the option of performing an assessment of certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or proceeding directly to a quantitative impairment test. Qualitative factors include but are not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance of the reporting unit. If the assessment of qualitative factors indicates that the carrying value is less than the fair value, then performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, goodwill is impaired. The impairment charge that would be recognized is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the reporting unit, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Favourable leases, customer relationships and interline contracts have amortization periods ranging from 15 to 20 years. When there is a change in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset with a finite life, amortization is adjusted prospectively.\n89 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nPensions and other benefits\nPension costs are actuarially determined using the projected-benefit method pro-rated over the credited service periods of employees. This method incorporates management\u2019s best estimates of expected plan investment performance, salary escalation and retirement ages of employees. The expected return on fund assets is calculated using market-related asset values developed from a five-year average of market values for the fund\u2019s public equity securities and absolute return strategies (with each prior year\u2019s market value adjusted to the current date for assumed investment income during the intervening period) plus the market value of the fund\u2019s fixed income, real estate, infrastructure and private debt securities, subject to the market-related asset value not being greater than 120% of the market value nor being less than 80% of the market value. The discount rate used to determine the projected-benefit obligation is based on blended market interest rates on high-quality debt instruments with matching cash flows. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation and the market-related value of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan (approximately 12 years). Prior service costs arising from collectively bargained amendments to pension plan benefit provisions are amortized over the term of the applicable union agreement. Prior service costs arising from all other sources are amortized over the expected average remaining service period of active employees who are expected to receive benefits under the plan at the date of amendment.\nCosts for post-retirement and post-employment benefits other than pensions, including post-retirement health care and life insurance and some workers\u2019 compensation and long-term disability benefits in Canada, are actuarially determined on a basis similar to pension costs.\nThe over or under funded status of defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation, and are recognized on the balance sheets. In addition, any unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits that arise during the period are recognized as a component of \u201cOther comprehensive loss\u201d, net of tax.\nGains and losses on post-employment benefits that do not vest or accumulate, including some workers\u2019 compensation and long-term disability benefits in Canada, are included immediately on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income as \"Other components of net periodic benefit cost or recovery\".\nThe current service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is reported in \"Compensation and benefits\" for pensions and post-retirement benefits, and in \"Purchased services and other\" for self-insured workers' compensation and long-term disability benefits on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Other components of net periodic benefit cost or recovery are reported in \"Other components of net periodic benefit cost or recovery\" outside of Operating income on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.\nCapitalization of pension costs, when applicable, is restricted to the current service cost component of net periodic benefit cost.\nFinancial instruments\nFinancial instruments are contracts that give rise to a financial asset of one party and a financial liability or equity instrument of another party. Financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value, which is the amount of consideration that would be agreed upon in an arm\u2019s-length transaction between willing parties.\nSubsequent measurement depends on how the financial instruments have been classified. Accounts receivable and other investments, classified as loans and receivables, are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method. Cash and cash equivalents and derivatives are classified as held for trading and are measured at fair value. Accounts payable, accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings, other long-term liabilities, and long-term debt are also measured at amortized cost.\nDerivative financial instruments\nDerivative financial and commodity instruments may be used from time to time by the Company to manage its exposure to risks relating to foreign currency exchange rates, stock-based compensation, interest rates, and fuel prices. When CP utilizes derivative instruments in hedging relationships, CP identifies, designates, and documents those hedging transactions and regularly tests the transactions to demonstrate effectiveness in order to continue hedge accounting.\nAll derivative instruments are classified as held for trading and recorded at fair value. Any change in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges is recognized in the period in which the change occurs in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income in the line item to which the derivative instrument is related.\nFor fair value hedges, the periodic changes in value are recognized in income, on the same line as the changes in value of the hedged items are also recorded. For an effective cash flow hedge, the entire change in value of the hedging instrument is recognized in \u201cOther comprehensive loss\u201d. The change in value of the effective cash flow hedge remains in \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive loss\u201d until the related hedged item settles, at which time amounts recognized in \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive loss\u201d are reclassified to the same income or balance sheet account that records the hedged item.\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 90\nCash flows relating to derivative instruments designated as hedges are included in the same line as the related hedged items on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nEnvironmental remediation\nEnvironmental remediation accruals, recorded on an undiscounted basis unless a reliably determinable estimate as to amount and timing of costs can be established, cover site-specific remediation programs. The accruals are recorded when the costs to remediate are probable and reasonably estimable. Certain future costs to monitor sites are discounted at an adjusted risk-free rate. Provisions for environmental remediation costs are recorded in \u201cOther long-term liabilities\u201d, except for the current portion, which is recorded in \u201cAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\u201d.\nStock-based compensation\nCP follows the fair value based approach to account for stock options. Compensation expense and an increase in \u201cAdditional paid-in capital\u201d are recognized for stock options over their vesting period or over the period from the grant date to the date employees become eligible to retire, when this is shorter than the vesting period, based on their fair values on the grant date as determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Forfeitures are estimated at issuance and monitored on a periodic basis. Any consideration paid by employees on exercise of stock options is credited to \u201cShare capital\u201d when the option is exercised and the recorded fair value of the option is removed from \u201cAdditional paid-in capital\" and credited to \u201cShare capital\u201d.\nCompensation expense is also recognized for performance share units (\u201cPSUs\u201d), performance deferred share units (\"PDSUs\"), deferred share units (\"DSUs\"), and restricted share units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) that settle in cash using the fair value method. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period or over the period from the grant date to the date employees become eligible to retire, when this is shorter than the vesting period where applicable. Forfeitures are estimated at issuance and monitored on a periodic basis.\nThe employee share purchase plan gives rise to compensation expense that is recognized using the issue price by amortizing the cost over the vesting period.\n2. Accounting changes\nImplemented in 2020\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the new Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), and all related amendments under FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. Using a modified retrospective approach, the Company recognized a cumulative-effect adjustment to its opening retained earnings balance in the period of adoption. Accordingly, comparative financial information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nThe impact of the adoption of ASC 326 as at January 1, 2020 was an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $1 million, with the offsets to \"Deferred income taxes\" and \"Retained earnings\" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 9 for further discussion of the current period credit loss.\nSimplification of Financial Disclosures about Guarantors\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, the Company early adopted the Securities and Exchange Commission amendments to the financial disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities, as specified in Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. The amendments simplify disclosure requirements by replacing condensed consolidating financial information (\u201cCCFI\u201d) with summarized financial information and expanded qualitative non-financial disclosures about the guarantees, issuers, and guarantors. This disclosure can be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources.\n91 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\n3. Revenues\nThe following table disaggregates the Company\u2019s revenues from contracts with customers by major source:\nContract liabilities\nContract liabilities represent payments received for performance obligations not yet satisfied and relate to deferred revenue and are presented as components of \"Accounts payable and accrued liabilities\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in contract liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n4. Other (income) expense\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 92\n5. Net interest expense\nInterest expense includes interest on finance leases of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (2019 - $11 million; 2018 - $11 million).\n6. Income taxes\nThe following is a summary of the major components of the Company\u2019s income tax expense:\n93 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nThe provision for deferred income taxes arises from temporary differences in the carrying values of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes and the effect of loss carry forwards. The items comprising the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nThe Company\u2019s consolidated effective income tax rate differs from the expected Canadian statutory tax rates. Expected income tax expense at statutory rates is reconciled to income tax expense as follows:\nIn 2020, the Company revalued its deferred income tax balances as a result of a tax filing election for the state of North Dakota resulting in a lower corporate income tax rate and a net recovery of $29 million.\nIn 2019, the Company revalued its deferred income tax balances as a result of a corporate income tax rate decrease in the province of Alberta, resulting in a net recovery of $88 million.\nIn 2018, the Company revalued its deferred income tax balances as a result of corporate income tax rate decreases in the states of Iowa and Missouri, resulting in a net recovery of $21 million.\nThe Company has not provided a deferred liability for the income taxes, if any, which might become payable on any temporary difference associated with its foreign investments because the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest in its foreign investments and has no intention to realize this difference by a sale of its interest in foreign investments. It is not practical to calculate the amount of the deferred tax liability.\nIt is more likely than not that the Company will realize the majority of its deferred income tax assets from the generation of future taxable income, as the payments for provisions, reserves and accruals are made and losses and tax credits carried forward are utilized.\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 94\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had tax effected operating losses carried forward of $15 million (2019 - $4 million), which have been recognized as a deferred tax asset. The losses carried forward will begin to expire in 2031. The Company expects to fully utilize these tax effected operating losses before their expiry. The Company did not have any minimum tax credits or investment tax credits carried forward.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had $2 million (2019 - $2 million) in tax effected capital losses carried forward recognized as a deferred tax asset. The Company has no unrecognized tax benefits from capital losses at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of uncertain tax positions in relation to unrecognized tax benefits for Canada and the U.S. for the year ended December 31:\nIf these uncertain tax positions were recognized, all of the amount of unrecognized tax positions as at December 31, 2020 would impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, a tax authority proposed an adjustment for a prior tax year without assessing taxes. Although the Company had commenced action to have the proposal removed, an increase in uncertain tax position was recorded on deferred income tax liability and expense in the amount of $24 million. While the proposed adjustment was withdrawn during 2020, the ultimate resolution of this matter may give rise to further favourable or unfavourable adjustments to deferred tax, the timing and amount of which are not determinable at this time.\nThe Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of \"Income tax expense\" in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income. The net amount of accrued interest and penalties in 2020 was a $1 million recovery (2019 - $1 million recovery; 2018 - $nil). The total amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2020 was $9 million (2019 - $10 million; 2018 - $11 million).\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to either Canadian federal and provincial income tax, U.S. federal, state and local income tax, or the relevant income tax in other international jurisdictions. The Company has substantially concluded all Canadian federal and provincial income tax matters for the years through 2014. The federal and provincial income tax returns filed for 2015 and subsequent years remain subject to examination by the Canadian taxation authorities. The Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") audit for 2012 and 2013 has been settled. The income tax returns for 2016 and subsequent years continue to remain subject to examination by the IRS and U.S. state tax jurisdictions. The Company believes that it has recorded sufficient income tax reserves at December 31, 2020 with respect to these income tax examinations.\n7. Earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share has been calculated using Net income for the year divided by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year.\nDiluted earnings per share has been calculated using the treasury stock method which assumes that any proceeds received from the exercise of in-the-money options would be used to purchase CP Common Shares at the average market price for the period. For purposes of this calculation, at December 31, 2020, there were 1.4 million dilutive options outstanding (2019 - 1.6 million; 2018 - 1.3 million).\n95 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nThe number of shares used in the earnings per share calculations are reconciled as follows:\nIn 2020, there were no options excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share (2019 - nil; 2018 - 0.2 million).\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 96\n8. Other comprehensive loss and accumulated other comprehensive loss\nThe components of Other comprehensive loss and the related tax effects are as follows:\nThe components of Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, are as follows:\n97 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nChanges in Accumulated other comprehensive loss by component are as follows:\n(1) Amounts are presented net of tax.\nAmounts in Pension and post-retirement defined benefit plans reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows:\n(1) Impacts \"Other components of net periodic benefit recovery\" on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n9. Accounts receivable, net\n(1) Prior year amounts have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method (Note 2).\n(1) Opening balance at January 1, 2020 was restated as described in Note 2.\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 98\n10. Business combinations\nDRTP\nOn December 22, 2020, CP completed its acquisition of the 83.5% ownership of the Detroit River Tunnel Partnership (\u201cDRTP\u201d) held by OMERS Infrastructure Management Inc. (\u201cOMERS\u201d) for cash, net of cash acquired, of $398 million. The purchase price is subject to customary closing adjustments, including any final adjustment for closing working capital and certain closing costs. With this acquisition CP obtained 100% ownership of DRTP. The acquisition of DRTP will reduce CP\u2019s operating costs related to movements through the tunnel which amounted to approximately $34 million in 2020, and better integrate the eastern part of the network. DRTP owns a 1.6-mile rail tunnel linking Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan and additional, separate lands in both cities. The acquisition was funded with cash from operations and CP's commercial paper program.\nThe acquisition of DRTP has been accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The fair values were estimated by applying an income approach using the discounted cash flow method of future cash flows, appraised land values reflecting a corridor enhancement factor where appropriate, and depreciated replacement cost for depreciable assets including the tunnel, track, signaling systems, and other railway related infrastructure assets.\nPrior to the close of the transaction, CP owned a 16.5% interest in DRTP, which was accounted for as an equity method investment. The previously held equity investment was remeasured to fair value which was determined from the negotiated purchase price that reflected a market value established in a competitive bid process. As a result of the acquisition, the Company recognized a before-tax gain of $68 million on the remeasurement to fair value of its equity interest within \"Purchased services and other\", calculated as the difference between the fair value of CP's 16.5% interest in DRTP of $81 million and the book value of the interest of $13 million.\nThe purchase price allocation was prepared on a preliminary basis and is subject to change as additional information becomes available concerning the fair value and tax bases of the net assets acquired. Any adjustments to the purchase price allocation will be made as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the date of acquisition.\nThe following summarizes the estimated fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities of DRTP:\nThe goodwill of $90 million relates primarily to the contract that DRTP has for CP\u2019s use of the tunnel and deferred taxes recognized as a result of the purchase price allocation. The goodwill recognized is not deductible for tax purposes.\nPrior to the acquisition of DRTP, CP had pre-existing agreements to use the tunnel and to operate and manage the tunnel on behalf of DRTP. On acquisition, no gain or loss was recognized in respect of the effective settlement of these pre-existing relationships as they were determined to be at fair market value based on an assessment of current market conditions and market participants.\nAcquired cash and cash equivalents of $6 million is presented as a reduction of cash used in investing activities in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n99 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nCP has not provided pro forma information relating to the pre-acquisition period as it is not material.\nCMQ\nOn December 30, 2019, CP purchased 100% of Central Maine & Qu\u00e9bec Railway Canada Inc. (\u201cCMQ Canada\u201d) and Central Maine & Qu\u00e9bec Railway U.S. Inc. (\u201cCMQ U.S.\u201d) (together \u201cCMQ\u201d) for cash consideration of $174 million. CMQ owns 237 miles of rail lines in Qu\u00e9bec and 244 miles of rail lines in Maine and Vermont.\nCMQ U.S.\nThe acquisition of CMQ U.S. was subject to approval from the United States Surface Transportation Board (\"STB\"). From the December 30, 2019 date of purchase, all purchased shares of CMQ U.S. were held in an independent voting trust (the \"Trust\") pending the STB's approval of CP's application for control of CMQ U.S. Approval was granted with an effective date of June 3, 2020. Between December 30, 2019 and June 3, 2020, CP accounted for its acquisition of CMQ U.S. as an equity method investment. During this time, CP paid additional consideration for CMQ of $3 million, representing changes from the finalization of previously estimated closing date working capital.\nOn June 3, 2020 the Trust was dissolved and CP assumed control of CMQ U.S. At this time, CP accounted for its acquisition in CMQ U.S. as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values as at June 3, 2020 and results from operations and cash flows were consolidated prospectively. There was no material change in the acquisition-date fair value of the equity interest held by the Company in CMQ U.S. immediately before the acquisition date. Fair values were determined primarily through the use of an income approach.\nAfter a measurement period adjustment of $1 million to increase Other long-term liabilities and goodwill resulting from the finalization of acquisition date deferred tax, the final allocation of total consideration to the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities of CMQ U.S. is summarized as follows:\nGoodwill of $52 million relates primarily to expected operating business synergies between the Company and CMQ U.S. The factors that contribute to the goodwill are revenue growth from customers which are currently not served by CP, access to new routes, and an assembled workforce. Goodwill recognized is not deductible for tax purposes.\nIntangible assets of $27 million reflect customer lists acquired in the purchase of CMQ U.S., and have amortization periods of 20 years.\nAcquired cash and cash equivalents of $22 million is presented as a reduction of cash used in investing activities on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and is presented net of finalized closing working capital adjustments for CMQ of $3 million as described above.\nCP has not provided pro forma information relating to the pre-acquisition period as it is not material.\nCMQ Canada\nThe acquisition of CMQ Canada was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 100\nThere have been no adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation. The final purchase price and allocation of the total consideration to the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired for CMQ Canada is summarized as follows:\nThe goodwill of $10 million relates primarily to expected operating business synergies. The factors that contribute to the goodwill are revenue growth from customers which are currently not served by CP, access to new routes and an assembled workforce. The goodwill recognized is not deductible for tax purposes.\nCP has not provided pro forma information relating to the pre-acquisition period as it is not material.\n11. Investments\n12. Properties\n(1) During 2020, CP capitalized costs attributable to the design and development of internal-use software in the amount of $45 million (2019 - $55 million; 2018 - $53 million). Current year depreciation expense related to internal use software was $42 million (2019 - $44 million; 2018 - $49 million).\n101 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nFinance leases included in properties\n13.

Debt\nLong-term debt includes debt instruments and finance lease obligations. The following table outlines the Company's outstanding long-term debt as at December 31, 2020:\nAt December 31, 2020, the gross amount of long-term debt denominated in U.S. dollars was U.S. $6,713 million (2019 - U.S. $6,016 million).\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 104\nAnnual maturities and principal repayment requirements, excluding those pertaining to finance leases, for each of the five years following 2020 are (in millions): 2021 - $1,178; 2022 - $471; 2023 - $475; 2024 - $83; 2025 - $891.\nFees on long-term debt are amortized to income over the term of the related debt.\nA. These debentures and notes are presented net of unamortized discounts, pay interest semi-annually, and are unsecured but carry a negative pledge.\nIn 2020, the Company issued U.S $500 million 2.050% 10-year Notes due March 5, 2030 for net proceeds of U.S. $495 million ($662 million) and $300 million 3.050% 30-year Notes due March 9, 2050 for net proceeds of $296 million.\nIn 2019, the Company repaid U.S. $350 million 7.250% 10-year Notes at maturity for a total of U.S. $350 million ($471 million). The Company also issued $400 million 3.150% 10-year Notes due March 13, 2029 for net proceeds of $397 million.\nB. On December 30, 2019, through its business combination with CMQ Canada, the Company assumed CMQ Canada's obligations under the 8.00% 5-year Promissory Notes totalling U.S. $8 million ($11 million) owing to CMQ U.S (see Note 10). In 2020, these notes were settled.\nC. The 5.41% Senior Secured Notes are collateralized by specific locomotive units with a carrying value of $97 million at December 31, 2020. The Company pays equal blended semi-annual payments of principal and interest. Final repayment of the remaining principal of U.S. $44 million is due in March 2024.\nD. The 6.91% Secured Equipment Notes are full recourse obligations of the Company collateralized by a first charge on specific locomotive units with a carrying value of $54 million at December 31, 2020. The Company pays equal blended semi-annual payments of principal and interest. Final repayment of the remaining principal of $11 million is due in October 2024.\nE. The 7.49% Equipment Trust Certificates are secured by specific locomotive units with a carrying value of $91 million at December 31, 2020. The Company makes semi-annual payments that vary in amount and are interest-only payments or blended principal and interest payments. Final repayment of the remaining principal of U.S. $11 million is due in January 2021.\nF. The carrying value of the assets collateralizing finance lease obligations was $171 million at December 31, 2020.\nG. The Consolidated Debenture Stock, authorized by an Act of Parliament of 1889, constitutes a first charge upon and over the whole of the undertaking, railways, works, rolling stock, plant, property and effects of the Company, with certain exceptions.\nCredit facility\nCP has a revolving credit facility (the \u201cfacility\u201d) agreement with 14 highly rated financial institutions for a commitment amount of U.S. $1.3 billion, which consists of a U.S. $1.0 billion tranche maturing September 27, 2024 and a U.S. $300 million tranche maturing September 27, 2021. The facility can accommodate draws of cash and/or letters of credit at market competitive pricing. The agreement requires the Company to maintain a financial covenant in conjunction with the facility. As at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company was in compliance with all terms and conditions of the credit facility arrangements and satisfied the financial covenant. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company drew and fully repaid U.S. $100 million from the U.S. $300 million tranche of its revolving credit facility. As at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the facility was undrawn.\nThe Company also has a commercial paper program which enables it to issue commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of U.S. $1.0 billion in the form of unsecured promissory notes. This commercial paper program is backed by the revolving credit facility. As at December 31, 2020, the Company had total commercial paper borrowings of U.S. $644 million ($820 million), included in \"Long-term debt maturing within one year\" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets (December 31, 2019 - $516 million). The weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings was 0.27% (December 31, 2019 - 2.03%). The Company presents issuances and repayments of commercial paper, all of which have a maturity of less than 90 days, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on a net basis.\nCP has bilateral letter of credit facilities with six highly rated financial institutions to support its requirement to post letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. Under these agreements, the Company has the option to post collateral in the form of cash or cash equivalents, equal at least to the face value of the letter of credit issued. These agreements permit CP to withdraw amounts posted as collateral at any time; therefore, the amounts posted as collateral are presented as \u201cCash and cash equivalents\u201d on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have any collateral posted on its bilateral letter of credit facilities but had letters of credit drawn of $59 million (December 31, 2019 - $80 million) from a total available amount of $300 million (December 31, 2019 - $300 million).\n105 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\n17. Financial instruments\nA. Fair values of financial instruments\nThe Company categorizes its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a three-level hierarchy established by GAAP that prioritizes those inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on the degree to which they are observable. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; Level 2 inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 inputs are not observable in the market.\nThe Company\u2019s short-term financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and short-term borrowings including commercial paper. The carrying value of short-term financial instruments approximate their fair values.\nThe carrying value of the Company\u2019s long-term debt does not approximate its fair value. The estimated fair value has been determined based on market information where available, or by discounting future payments of principal and interest at estimated interest rates expected to be available to the Company at period end. All measurements are classified as Level 2. The Company\u2019s long-term debt, including current maturities, with a carrying value of $8,951 million at December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019 - $8,241 million), had a fair value of $11,597 million (December 31, 2019 - $10,149 million).\nB. Financial risk management\nDerivative financial instruments\nDerivative financial instruments may be used to selectively reduce volatility associated with fluctuations in interest rates, FX rates, the price of fuel, and stock-based compensation expense. Where derivatives are designated as hedging instruments, the relationship between the hedging instruments and their associated hedged items is documented, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for the use of the hedging instruments. This documentation includes linking the derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, commitments, or forecasted transactions. At the time a derivative contract is entered into and at least quarterly thereafter, an assessment is made as to whether the derivative item is effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items. The derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment if it is effective in substantially mitigating the risk it was designed to address.\nIt is not the Company\u2019s intent to use financial derivatives or commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nCredit risk management\nCredit risk refers to the possibility that a customer or counterparty will fail to fulfill its obligations under a contract and as a result create a financial loss for the Company.\nThe railway industry predominantly serves financially established customers, and the Company has experienced limited financial losses with respect to credit risk. The credit worthiness of customers is assessed using credit scores supplied by a third party and through direct monitoring of their financial well-being on a continual basis. The Company establishes guidelines for customer credit limits and should thresholds in these areas be reached, appropriate precautions are taken to improve collectability.\nCounterparties to financial instruments expose the Company to credit losses in the event of non-performance. Counterparties for derivative and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions, which are monitored on an ongoing basis. Counterparty credit assessments are based on the financial health of the institutions and their credit ratings from external agencies. The Company does not anticipate non-performance that would materially impact the Company\u2019s financial statements. In addition, the Company believes there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.\nFX management\nThe Company conducts business transactions and owns assets in both Canada and the United States. As a result, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in the value of financial commitments, assets, liabilities, income, or cash flows due to changes in FX rates. The Company may enter into FX risk management transactions primarily to manage fluctuations in the exchange rate between Canadian and U.S. currencies. FX exposure is primarily mitigated through natural offsets created by revenues, expenditures, and balance sheet positions incurred in the same currency. Where appropriate, the Company may negotiate with customers and suppliers to reduce the net exposure.\nNet investment hedge\nThe FX gains and losses on long-term debt are mainly unrealized and can only be realized when U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt matures or is settled. The Company also has long-term FX exposure on its investment in foreign subsidiaries with a U.S. dollar functional currency. The majority of the Company\u2019s U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt has been designated as a hedge of the net investment in these foreign subsidiaries. This designation has the effect of mitigating volatility on Net income by offsetting long-term FX gains and losses on U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt and gains and losses on its net investment. The effect of the net investment hedge recognized in \u201cOther comprehensive loss\u201d in 2020 was an FX gain of $136 million, the majority of which was unrealized (2019 - unrealized gain of $288 million; 2018 - unrealized loss of $479 million) (see Note 8).\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 106\nInterest rate management\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk, which is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will vary as a result of changes in market interest rates. In order to manage funding needs or capital structure goals, the Company enters into debt or finance lease agreements that are subject to either fixed market interest rates set at the time of issue or floating rates determined by ongoing market conditions. Debt subject to variable interest rates exposes the Company to variability in interest expense, while debt subject to fixed interest rates exposes the Company to variability in the fair value of debt.\nTo manage interest rate exposure, the Company accesses diverse sources of financing and manages borrowings in line with a targeted range of capital structure, debt ratings, liquidity needs, maturity schedule, and currency and interest rate profiles. In anticipation of future debt issuances, the Company may enter into forward rate agreements, that are designated as cash flow hedges, to substantially lock in all or a portion of the effective future interest expense. The Company may also enter into swap agreements, designated as fair value hedges, to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt.\nForward starting swaps\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, the Company settled a notional amount of U.S. $500 million of forward starting swaps related to the U.S. $500 million 4.000% 10-year Notes issued in the same period. The fair value of these derivative instruments at the time of settlement was a loss of U.S. $19 million ($24 million). The Company no longer has any active forward starting swaps.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, a net loss of $9 million related to previously settled forward starting swap hedges has been amortized to \u201cNet interest expense\u201d (2019 - loss of $9 million; 2018 - loss of $10 million). The Company expects that during the next 12 months, $9 million of net losses will be amortized to \u201cNet interest expense\u201d.\nTreasury rate locks\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had net unamortized losses related to interest rate locks, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges, settled in previous years totalling $17 million (December 31, 2019 - $18 million). This amount is composed of various unamortized gains and losses related to specific debts which are reflected in \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive loss\u201d and are amortized to \u201cNet interest expense\u201d in the period that interest on the related debt is charged. The amortization of these gains and losses resulted in a $1 million increase to \u201cNet interest expense\u201d and \u201cOther comprehensive loss\u201d in 2020 (2019 - $1 million; 2018 - $1 million). The Company expects that during the next 12 months, a net loss of $1 million related to these previously settled derivatives will be reclassified to \u201cNet interest expense\u201d.\n18. Other long-term liabilities\n(1) As at December 31, 2020, the aggregate provision for environmental remediation, including the current portion was $80 million (2019 - $77 million).\n(2) 2019 comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with current presentation.\n(3) The deferred real estate lease and license revenue and deferred gains on sale leaseback transactions are being amortized to income on a straight-line basis over the related lease terms.\nEnvironmental remediation accruals\nEnvironmental remediation accruals cover site-specific remediation programs. The estimate of the probable costs to be incurred in the remediation of properties contaminated by past railway activities reflects the nature of contamination at individual sites according to typical activities and scale of operations conducted. CP has developed remediation strategies for each property based on the nature and extent of the contamination, as well as the location of the property and surrounding areas that may be adversely affected by the presence of contaminants, considering available technologies, treatment and disposal facilities and the acceptability of site-specific plans based on the local regulatory environment. Site-specific plans range from containment and risk management of the contaminants through to the removal and treatment of the contaminants and affected soils and groundwater. The details of the estimates reflect the environmental liability at each property. Provisions for environmental remediation costs are recorded in \u201cOther long-term liabilities\u201d, except for the current portion which is recorded in \u201cAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\u201d (see Note 15). Payments are expected to be made over 10 years to 2030.\n107 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nThe accruals for environmental remediation represent CP\u2019s best estimate of its probable future obligation and include both asserted and unasserted claims, without reduction for anticipated recoveries from third parties. Although the recorded accruals include CP\u2019s best estimate of all probable costs, CP\u2019s total environmental remediation costs cannot be predicted with certainty. Accruals for environmental remediation may change from time to time as new information about previously untested sites becomes known, environmental laws and regulations evolve and advances are made in environmental remediation technology. The accruals may also vary as the courts decide legal proceedings against outside parties responsible for contamination. These potential charges, which cannot be quantified at this time, may materially affect income in the particular period in which a charge is recognized. Costs related to existing, but as yet unknown, or future contamination will be accrued in the period in which they become probable and reasonably estimable. Changes to costs are reflected as changes to \u201cOther long-term liabilities\u201d or \u201cAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\u201d on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and to \u201cPurchased services and other\u201d within operating expenses on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The amount charged to income in 2020 was $10 million (2019 - $6 million; 2018 - $6 million).\n19. Leases\nThe Company\u2019s leases have remaining terms of less than one year to 14 years, some include options to extend up to an additional 10 years, and some include options to terminate within one year.\nResidual value guarantees are provided on certain vehicle operating leases. Cumulatively, these guarantees are limited to $1 million and are not included in lease liabilities as it is not currently probable that any amounts will be owed.\nComponents of lease expense for the year ended December 31 are as follows:\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases is as follows:\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 108\nThe following table provides the Company's weighted-average remaining lease terms and discount rates:\nSupplemental information related to leases is as follows:\nThe following table provides the maturities of lease liabilities for the next five years and thereafter as at December 31, 2020:\n20. Shareholders\u2019 equity\nAuthorized and issued share capital\nThe Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of Common Shares, an unlimited number of First Preferred Shares, and an unlimited number of Second Preferred Shares. At December 31, 2020, no First or Second Preferred Shares had been issued.\n109 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nThe following table summarizes information related to Common Share balances as at December 31:\nThe change in the \u201cShare capital\u201d balance includes $10 million of stock-based compensation transferred from \u201cAdditional paid-in capital\u201d (2019 - $7 million; 2018 - $12 million).\nShare repurchases\nOn December 17, 2019, the Company announced a normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\"), commencing December 20, 2019, to purchase up to 4.80 million Common Shares in the open market for cancellation on or before December 19, 2020. Upon expiry of this NCIB, the Company had purchased 4.27 million Common Shares for $1,577 million.\nOn October 19, 2018, the Company announced a NCIB, commencing October 24, 2018, to purchase up to 5.68 million Common Shares for cancellation on or before October 23, 2019. The Company completed this NCIB on October 23, 2019.\nOn May 10, 2017, the Company announced a NCIB, commencing May 15, 2017, to purchase up to 4.38 million Common Shares in the open market for cancellation on or before May 14, 2018. The Company completed this NCIB on May 10, 2018.\nAll purchases were made in accordance with the respective NCIB at prevailing market prices plus brokerage fees, or such other prices that were permitted by the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\"), with consideration allocated to \"Share capital\" up to the average carrying amount of the shares and any excess allocated to \"Retained earnings\".\nThe following table provides activities under the share repurchase programs for each of the years ended December 31:\n(1) Includes shares repurchased but not yet cancelled at year end.\n(2) Includes brokerage fees.\nOn January 27, 2021, the Company announced that the TSX has accepted its notice to implement a new NCIB, commencing January 29, 2021, to purchase up to approximately 3.33 million Common Shares for cancellation on or before January 28, 2022.\n21. Change in non-cash working capital balances related to operations\n22. Pensions and other benefits\nThe Company has both defined benefit (\u201cDB\u201d) and defined contribution (\u201cDC\u201d) pension plans. At December 31, 2020, the Canadian pension plans represent nearly all of total combined pension plan assets and nearly all of total combined pension plan obligations.\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 110\nThe DB plans provide for pensions based principally on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. Pensions for Canadian pensioners are partially indexed to inflation. Annual employer contributions to the DB plans, which are actuarially determined, are made on the basis of being not less than the minimum amounts required by federal pension supervisory authorities.\nThe Company has other benefit plans including post-retirement health and life insurance for pensioners, and post-employment long-term disability and workers\u2019 compensation benefits, which are based on Company-specific claims. At December 31, 2020, the Canadian other benefits plans represent nearly all of total combined other plan obligations.\nThe Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors has approved an investment policy that establishes long-term asset mix targets which take into account the Company\u2019s expected risk tolerances. Pension plan assets are managed by a suite of independent investment managers, with the allocation by manager reflecting these asset mix targets. Most of the assets are actively managed with the objective of outperforming applicable benchmarks. In accordance with the investment policy, derivative instruments may be used by investment managers to hedge or adjust existing or anticipated exposures.\nTo develop the expected long-term rate of return assumption used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost applicable to the market-related value of plan assets, the Company considers the expected composition of the plans\u2019 assets, past experience, and future estimates of long-term investment returns. Future estimates of investment returns reflect the long-term return expectation for fixed income, public equity, real estate, infrastructure, private debt, and absolute return investments, and the expected added value (relative to applicable benchmark indices) from active management of pension fund assets.\nThe Company has elected to use a market-related value of assets for the purpose of calculating net periodic benefit cost, developed from a five year average of market values for the plans\u2019 public equity and absolute return investments (with each prior year\u2019s market value adjusted to the current date for assumed investment income during the intervening period) plus the market value of the plans\u2019 fixed income, real estate, infrastructure, and private debt securities.\nThe benefit obligation is discounted using a discount rate that is a blended yield to maturity for a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with cash flows matching projected benefit payments. The discount rate is determined by management.\nNet periodic benefit cost\nThe elements of net periodic benefit cost for DB pension plans and other benefits recognized in the year include the following components:\n111 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nProjected benefit obligation, fund assets, and funded status\nInformation about the Company\u2019s DB pension plans and other benefits, in aggregate, is as follows:\nThe net actuarial losses for Pensions and Other benefits in 2020 were primarily due to the decrease in discount rate from 3.25% to 2.58%. The net actuarial losses for Pensions and Other benefits in 2019 were primarily due to the decrease in discount rate from 4.01% to 3.25%.\nThe table below shows the aggregate pension projected benefit obligation and aggregate fair value of plan assets for pension plans with fair value of plan assets in excess of projected benefit obligations (i.e. surplus), and for pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of fair value of plan assets (i.e. deficit):\nThe DB pension plans\u2019 accumulated benefit obligation as at December 31, 2020 was $13,528 million (2019 - $12,201 million). The accumulated benefit obligation is calculated on a basis similar to the projected benefit obligation, except no future salary increases are assumed in the projection of future benefits. For pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of fair value of plan assets (i.e. deficit), the aggregate pension accumulated benefit obligation as at December 31, 2020 was $443 million (2019 - $419 million) and the aggregate fair value of plan assets as at December 31, 2020 was $187 million (2019 -$186 million).\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 112\nAll Other benefits plans were in a deficit position at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nPension asset and liabilities in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets\nAmounts recognized in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:\nThe measurement date used to determine the plan assets and the accrued benefit obligation is December 31. The most recent actuarial valuation for pension funding purposes for the Company\u2019s main Canadian pension plan was performed as at January 1, 2020. During 2021, the Company expects to file with the pension regulator a new valuation performed as at January 1, 2021.\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows:\nActuarial assumptions\nWeighted-average actuarial assumptions used were approximately:\n(1) The health care cost trend rate was assumed to be 6.00% in 2019 and 5.50% in 2020 and is assumed to be 5.00% per year in 2021 and thereafter.\n(2) The health care cost trend rate was previously assumed to be 7.00% in 2018, and then decreasing by 0.50% per year to an ultimate rate of 5.00% per year in 2022 and thereafter.\n(3) The expected rate of return on fund assets that will be used to compute the 2021 net periodic benefit credit is 6.90%.\nPlan assets\nPlan assets are recorded at fair value. The major asset categories are public equity securities, fixed income securities, real estate, infrastructure, absolute return investments, and private debt. The fair values of the public equity and fixed income securities are primarily based on quoted market prices. Real estate and infrastructure values are based on the value of each fund\u2019s assets as calculated by the fund manager, generally using third party appraisals or discounted cash flow analysis and taking into account current market conditions and recent sales transactions where practical and appropriate. Private debt values are\n113 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nbased on the value of each fund\u2019s assets as calculated by the fund manager taking into account current market conditions and reviewed annually by external parties. Absolute return investments are a portfolio of units of externally managed hedge funds and are valued by the fund administrators.\nThe Company\u2019s pension plan asset allocation, the weighted-average asset allocation targets, and the weighted average policy range for each major asset class at year end were as follows:\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 114\nSummary of the assets of the Company\u2019s DB pension plans\nThe following is a summary of the assets of the Company\u2019s DB pension plans at December 31, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no plan assets classified as Level 3 valued investments.\n115 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\n(1) Investments measured at net asset value (\"NAV\"):\nAmounts are comprised of certain investments measured using NAV (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. These investments have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n(2) Government & Corporate Bonds:\nFair values for bonds are based on market prices supplied by independent sources as of the last trading day.\n(3) Mortgages:\nThe fair values of mortgages are based on current market yields of financial instruments of similar maturity, coupon and risk factors.\n(4) Real estate:\nReal estate fund values are based on the NAV of the funds that invest directly in real estate investments. The values of the investments have been estimated using the capital accounts representing the plan\u2019s ownership interest in the funds. Of the total, $580 million is subject to redemption frequencies ranging from monthly to annually and a redemption notice period of 90 days (2019 - $606 million). The remaining $124 million is not subject to redemption and is normally returned through distributions as a result of the liquidation of the underlying real estate investments (2019 - $118 million). As at December 31, 2020, there are $32 million of unfunded commitments for real estate investments (December 31, 2019 - $35 million).\n(5) Infrastructure:\nInfrastructure fund values are based on the NAV of the funds that invest directly in infrastructure investments. The values of the investments have been estimated using the capital accounts representing the plans' ownership interest in the funds. Of the total, $112 million is subject to redemption frequencies ranging from monthly to annually and a redemption notice period of 90 days (2019 - $119 million). The remaining $87 million is not subject to redemption and is normally returned through distributions as a result of the liquidation of the underlying infrastructure investments (2019 - $68 million). As at December 31, 2020, there are $491 million of unfunded commitments for infrastructure investments (December 31, 2019 - $286 million).\n(6) Private debt:\nPrivate debt fund values are based on the NAV of the funds that invest directly in private debt investments. The values of the investments have been estimated using the capital accounts representing the plans' ownership interest in the funds. Of the total, $154 million is subject to redemption frequencies ranging from monthly to annually and a redemption notice period of 90 days (2019 - $154 million). The remaining $311 million is not subject to redemption and is normally returned through distributions as a result of the repayment of the underlying loans (2019 - $159 million). As at December 31, 2020, there are $533 million of unfunded commitments for private debt investments (December 31, 2019 - $392 million).\n(7) Derivatives:\nThe investment managers may utilize the following derivative instruments: equity futures to replicate equity index returns (Level 2); currency forwards to partially hedge foreign currency exposures (Level 2); bond forwards to reduce asset/liability interest rate risk exposures (Level 2); interest rate swaps to manage duration and interest rate risk (Level 2); credit default swaps to manage credit risk (Level 2); and options to manage interest rate risk and volatility (Level 2). The Company may utilize derivatives directly, but only for the purpose of hedging foreign currency exposures. As at December 31, 2020, there are currency forwards with a notional value of $1,041 million (December 31, 2019 - $334 million) and a fair value of $73 million (December 31, 2019 - $13 million). The fixed income investment manager utilizes a portfolio of bond forwards for the purpose of reducing asset/liability interest rate exposure. As at December 31, 2020, there are bond forwards with a notional value of $3,540 million (December 31, 2019 - $3,269 million) and a negative fair value of $2 million (December 31, 2019 - $(72) million).\n(8) Absolute return:\nThe value of absolute return fund investments is based on the NAV reported by the fund administrators. The funds have different redemption policies with redemption notice periods varying from 60 to 95 days and frequencies ranging from monthly to triennially.\nAdditional plan assets information\nThe Company's primary investment objective for pension plan assets is to achieve a long-term return, net of all fees and expenses, that is sufficient for the plan's assets to satisfy the current and future obligations to plan beneficiaries, while minimizing the financial impact on the Company. In identifying the asset allocation ranges, consideration was given to the long-term nature of the underlying plan liabilities, the solvency and going-concern financial position of the plan, long-term return expectations, and the risks associated with key asset classes as well as the relationships of returns on key asset classes with each other, inflation, and interest rates. When advantageous and with due consideration, derivative instruments may be utilized by investment managers, provided the total value of the underlying assets represented by financial derivatives (excluding currency forwards, liability hedging derivatives in fixed income portfolios, and derivatives held by absolute return funds) is limited to 30% of the market value of the fund.\nThe funded status of the plans is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, which affects the relative values of the plans' liabilities and assets. In order to mitigate interest rate risk, the Company's main Canadian defined benefit pension plan utilizes a liability driven investment strategy in its fixed income portfolio, which uses a combination of long duration bonds and derivatives to hedge interest rate risk, managed by the investment manager. At December 31, 2020, the plan's solvency funded position was 47% hedged against interest rate risk (2019 - 45%).\nWhen investing in foreign securities, the plans are exposed to foreign currency risk; the effect of which is included in the valuation of the foreign securities. At December 31, 2020, the plans were 33% exposed to the U.S. dollar net of currency forwards (40% excluding the currency forwards), 6% exposed to the Euro, and 14% exposed to various other currencies. At December 31, 2019, the plans were 39% exposed to the U.S. dollar net of currency forwards (41% excluding the currency forwards), 6% exposed to the Euro, and 14% exposed to various other currencies.\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 116\nAt December 31, 2020, fund assets included 109,008 of the Common Shares of the Company (2019 - 119,758) at a market value of $48 million (2019 - $40 million).\nEstimated future benefit payments\nThe estimated future DB pension and other benefit payments to be paid by the plans for each of the next five years and the subsequent five-year period are as follows:\nThe benefit payments from the Canadian registered and U.S. qualified DB pension plans are payable from their respective pension funds. Benefit payments from the supplemental pension plan and from the other benefits plans are payable directly from the Company.\nDefined contribution plan\nCanadian non-unionized employees hired prior to July 1, 2010 had the option to participate in the Canadian DC plan. All Canadian non-unionized employees hired after such date must participate in this plan. Employee contributions are based on a percentage of salary. The Company matches employee contributions to a maximum percentage each year.\nEffective July 1, 2010, a new U.S. DC plan was established. All U.S. non-unionized employees hired after such date must participate in this plan. Employees do not contribute to the plan. The Company annually contributes a percentage of salary.\nThe DC plans provide a pension based on total employee, where appropriate, and employer contributions plus investment income earned on those contributions.\nIn 2020, the net cost of the DC plans, which generally equals the employer\u2019s required contribution, was $12 million (2019 - $11 million; 2018 - $10 million).\nContributions to multi-employer plans\nSome of the Company\u2019s unionized employees in the U.S. are members of a U.S. national multi-employer benefit plan. Contributions made by the Company to this plan in 2020 in respect of post-retirement medical benefits were $3 million (2019 - $3 million; 2018 - $3 million).\n23. Stock-based compensation\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had several stock-based compensation plans including stock option plans, various cash-settled liability plans, and an employee share purchase plan. These plans resulted in an expense of $170 million in 2020 (2019 - $133 million; 2018 - $75 million).\n117 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nA. Stock option plan\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s stock option plan as at December 31, 2020:\n(1) As at December 31, 2020, the weighted-average remaining term of vested or expected to vest options was 4.5 years with an aggregate intrinsic value of $297 million.\nThe following table provides the number of stock options outstanding and exercisable as at December 31, 2020 by range of exercise price and their related intrinsic aggregate value, and for options outstanding, the weighted-average years to expiration. The table also provides the aggregate intrinsic value for in-the-money stock options, which represents the amount that would have been received by option holders had they exercised their options on December 31, 2020 at the Company\u2019s closing stock price of $441.53.\n(1) As at December 31, 2020, the total number of in-the-money stock options outstanding was 1,387,366 with a weighted-average exercise price of $225.20. The weighted-average years to expiration of exercisable stock options is 3.6 years.\nPursuant to the employee plan, options may be exercised upon vesting, which is between 12 months and 48 months after the grant date, and will expire after seven years. Certain stock options granted in 2019 and 2018 vest upon the achievement of specific performance criteria. Under the fair value method, the fair value of the stock options at grant date was approximately $15 million for options issued in 2020 (2019 - $14 million; 2018 - $16 million). The weighted-average fair value assumptions were approximately:\n(1) Represents the period of time that awards are expected to be outstanding. Historical data on exercise behaviour or, when available, specific expectations regarding future exercise behaviour were used to estimate the expected life of the option.\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 118\n(2) Based on the implied yield available on zero-coupon government issues with an equivalent term commensurate with the expected term of the option.\n(3) Based on the historical volatility of the Company\u2019s stock price over a period commensurate with the expected term of the option.\n(4) Determined by the current annual dividend at the time of grant. The Company does not employ different dividend yields throughout the contractual term of the option. On July 21, 2020, the Company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.9500 per share, representing $3.8000 on an annual basis.\n(5) The Company estimates forfeitures based on past experience. The rate is monitored on a periodic basis.\nIn 2020, the expense for stock options (regular and performance) was $16 million (2019 - $14 million; 2018 - $10 million). At December 31, 2020, there was $12 million of total unrecognized compensation related to stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.1 years.\nThe total fair value of shares vested for the stock option plan during 2020 was $10 million (2019 - $8 million; 2018 - $11 million).\nThe following table provides information related to all options exercised in the stock option plan during the years ended December 31:\nB. Other share-based plans\nPerformance share unit plans\nDuring 2020, the Company issued 97,998 PSUs with a grant date fair value of approximately $34 million and 10,029 PDSUs with a grant date fair value, including value of expected future matching units, of approximately $4 million. PSUs and PDSUs attract dividend equivalents in the form of additional units, based on dividends paid on the Company's Common Shares, and vest approximately three years after the grant date contingent upon CP\u2019s performance (\"performance factor\"). The fair value of these PSUs and PDSUs is measured periodically until settlement using closing share price on the date of measurement. The fair value of units that are probable of vesting based on forecasted performance factors over the three-year performance period is recognized as expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Vested PSUs are settled in cash. Vested PDSUs are settled in cash pursuant to the DSU plan and are eligible for a 25% match if the holder has not exceeded their share ownership requirements, and are paid out only when the holder ceases their employment with CP.\nThe performance period for PSUs and PDSUs issued in 2020 is January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022, and the performance factors are Return on Invested Capital (\"ROIC\"), Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") compared to the S&P/TSX 60 Index, and TSR compared to Class I railways.\nThe performance period for 133,681 PSUs issued in 2019 is January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021, and the performance factors for these PSUs are ROIC, TSR compared to the S&P/TSX 60 Index, and TSR compared to Class I railways. The performance factors for the remaining 579 PSUs are annual revenue for the fiscal year 2020, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year 2020, and share price appreciation.\nThe performance period for 125,280 PSUs issued in 2018 is January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020, and the performance factors for these PSUs were ROIC, TSR compared to the S&P/TSX Capped Industrial Index, and TSR compared to the S&P 1500 Road and Rail Index. The resulting estimated payout on these awards was 200% on 113,769 total outstanding awards representing a total fair value of $98 million at December 31, 2020, calculated using the Company's average share price of the last 30 trading days preceding December 31, 2020. The performance factors for the remaining 36,975 PSUs were annual revenue for the fiscal year 2020, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year 2020, and share price appreciation.\nThe performance period for PSUs issued in 2017 was January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019, and the performance factors for these PSUs were ROIC, TSR compared to the S&P/TSX Capped Industrial Index, and TSR compared to the S&P 1500 Road and Rail Index. The resulting payout was 193% of the outstanding units multiplied by the Company's average share price calculated using the last 30 trading days preceding December 31, 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, payouts occurred on the total outstanding awards, including dividends reinvested, totalling $76 million on 121,225 outstanding awards.\n119 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nThe following table summarizes information related to the Company\u2019s PSUs and PDSUs as at December 31:\nIn 2020, the expense for PSUs and PDSUs was $121 million (2019 - $89 million; 2018 - $54 million). At December 31, 2020, there was $51 million of total unrecognized compensation related to these awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.4 years.\nDeferred share unit plan\nThe Company established the DSU plan as a means to compensate and assist in attaining share ownership targets set for certain key employees and Directors. A DSU entitles the holder to receive, upon redemption, a cash payment equivalent to the Company's average share price using the 10 trading days prior to redemption. DSUs vest over various periods of up to 36 months and are only redeemable for a specified period after employment is terminated.\nSenior managers may elect to receive DSUs in lieu of annual bonus cash payments in the bonus deferral program. In addition, senior managers will be granted a 25% company match of DSUs when deferring cash to DSUs to meet ownership targets. The election to receive eligible payments in DSUs is no longer available to a participant when the value of the participant\u2019s DSUs is sufficient to meet the Company\u2019s stock ownership guidelines. Senior managers have five years to meet their ownership targets.\nThe expense for DSUs is recognized over the vesting period for both the initial subscription price and the change in value between reporting periods.\nThe following table summarizes information related to the DSUs as at December 31:\nDuring 2020, the Company granted 19,041 DSUs with a grant date fair value of approximately $7 million. In 2020, the expense for DSUs was $21 million (2019 - $20 million expense; 2018 - $4 million expense). At December 31, 2020, there was $1 million of total unrecognized compensation related to DSUs which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.3 years.\nSummary of share-based liabilities paid\nThe following table summarizes the total share-based liabilities paid for each of the years ended December 31:\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 120\nC. Employee share purchase plan\nThe Company has an employee share purchase plan whereby both employee and the Company contributions are used to purchase shares on the open market for employees. The Company\u2019s contributions are expensed over the one year vesting period. Under the plan, the Company matches $1 for every $3 contributed by employees up to a maximum employee contribution of 6% of annual salary.\nThe total number of shares purchased in 2020 on behalf of participants, including the Company's contributions, was 115,344 (2019 - 137,942; 2018 - 118,865). In 2020, the Company\u2019s contributions totalled $9 million (2019 - $8 million; 2018 - $6 million) and the related expense was $7 million (2019 - $6 million; 2018 - $5 million).\n24. Variable interest entities\nThe Company leases equipment from certain trusts, which have been determined to be variable interest entities financed by a combination of debt and equity provided by unrelated third parties. The lease agreements, which are classified as operating leases, have fixed price purchase options which create the Company\u2019s variable interests and result in the trusts being considered variable interest entities.\nMaintaining and operating the leased assets according to specific contractual obligations outlined in the terms of the lease agreements and industry standards is the Company\u2019s responsibility. The rigour of the contractual terms of the lease agreements and industry standards are such that the Company has limited discretion over the maintenance activities associated with these assets. As such, the Company concluded these terms do not provide the Company with the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entities in a way that has a significant impact on the entities\u2019 economic performance.\nThe financial exposure to the Company as a result of its involvement with the variable interest entities is equal to the fixed lease payments due to the trusts. In 2020, lease payments after tax were $14 million. Future minimum lease payments, before tax, of $126 million will be payable over the next 10 years. The Company does not guarantee the residual value of the assets to the lessor; however, it must deliver to the lessor the assets in good operating condition, subject to normal wear and tear, at the end of the lease term.\nAs the Company\u2019s actions and decisions do not significantly affect the variable interest entities\u2019 performance, and the Company\u2019s fixed price purchase option is not considered to be potentially significant to the variable interest entities, the Company is not considered to be the primary beneficiary, and does not consolidate these variable interest entities.\n25. Commitments and contingencies\nIn the normal course of its operations, the Company becomes involved in various legal actions, including claims relating to injuries and damage to property. The Company maintains provisions it considers to be adequate for such actions. While the final outcome with respect to actions outstanding or pending at December 31, 2020 cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of management that their resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, or results of operations. However, an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular quarter or fiscal year.\nCommitments\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had committed to total future capital expenditures amounting to $547 million and operating expenditures relating to supplier purchase obligations, such as bulk fuel purchase agreements, locomotive maintenance and overhaul agreements, as well as agreements to purchase other goods and services amounting to approximately $1.7 billion for the years 2021-2032, of which CP estimates approximately $1.6 billion will be incurred in the next five years.\nCommitments related to leases, including minimum annual payments for the next five years and thereafter, are included in Note 19.\nLegal proceedings related to Lac-M\u00e9gantic rail accident\nOn July 6, 2013, a train carrying petroleum crude oil operated by Montr\u00e9al Maine and Atlantic Railway (\u201cMMAR\u201d) or a subsidiary, Montr\u00e9al Maine & Atlantic Canada Co. (\u201cMMAC\u201d and collectively the \u201cMMA Group\u201d), derailed in Lac-M\u00e9gantic, Qu\u00e9bec. The derailment occurred on a section of railway owned and operated by the MMA Group and while the MMA Group exclusively controlled the train.\nFollowing the derailment, MMAC sought court protection in Canada under the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act and MMAR filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. Plans of arrangement were approved in both Canada and the U.S. (the \u201cPlans\u201d), providing for the distribution of approximately $440 million amongst those claiming derailment damages.\nA number of legal proceedings, set out below, were commenced in Canada and the U.S. against CP and others:\n(1)Qu\u00e9bec's Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks ordered various parties, including CP, to remediate the derailment site (the \"Cleanup Order\") and served CP with a Notice of Claim for $95 million for those costs. CP appealed the Cleanup Order and contested the Notice\n121 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT\nof Claim with the Administrative Tribunal of Qu\u00e9bec. These proceedings are stayed pending determination of the Attorney General of Qu\u00e9bec (\u201cAGQ\u201d) action (paragraph 2 below).\n(2)The AGQ sued CP in the Qu\u00e9bec Superior Court claiming $409 million in damages, which was amended and reduced to $315 million (the \u201cAGQ Action\u201d). The AGQ Action alleges that: (i) CP was responsible for the petroleum crude oil from its point of origin until its delivery to Irving Oil Ltd.; and (ii) CP is vicariously liable for the acts and omissions of the MMA Group.\n(3)A class action in the Qu\u00e9bec Superior Court on behalf of persons and entities residing in, owning or leasing property in, operating a business in, or physically present in Lac-M\u00e9gantic at the time of the derailment was certified against CP on May 8, 2015 (the \"Class Action\"). Other defendants including MMAC and Mr. Thomas Harding (\"Harding\") were added to the Class Action on January 25, 2017. The Class Action seeks unquantified damages, including for wrongful death, personal injury, property damage, and economic loss.\n(4)Eight subrogated insurers sued CP in the Qu\u00e9bec Superior Court claiming approximately $16 million in damages, which was amended and reduced to approximately $15 million (the \u201cPromutuel Action\u201d), and two additional subrogated insurers sued CP claiming approximately $3 million in damages (the \u201cRoyal Action\u201d). Both actions contain similar allegations as the AGQ Action. The actions do not identify the subrogated parties. As such, the extent of any overlap between the damages claimed in these actions and under the Plans is unclear. The Royal Action is stayed pending determination of the consolidated proceedings described below.\nOn December 11, 2017, the AGQ Action, the Class Action and the Promutuel Action were consolidated. These consolidated claims are currently scheduled for a joint liability trial commencing on or around September 13, 2021, followed by a damages trial, if necessary.\n(5)Forty-eight plaintiffs (all individual claims joined in one action) sued CP, MMAC, and Harding in the Qu\u00e9bec Superior Court claiming approximately $5 million in damages for economic loss and pain and suffering, and asserting similar allegations as in the Class Action and the AGQ Action. The majority of the plaintiffs opted-out of the Class Action and all but two are also plaintiffs in litigation against CP, described in paragraph 7 below. This action is stayed pending determination of the consolidated claims described above.\n(6)The MMAR U.S. bankruptcy estate representative commenced an action against CP in November 2014 in the Maine Bankruptcy Court claiming that CP failed to abide by certain regulations and seeking approximately U.S. $30 million in damages for MMAR\u2019s loss in business value according to a recent report. This action asserts that CP knew or ought to have known that the shipper misclassified the petroleum crude oil and therefore should have refused to transport it.\n(7)The class and mass tort action commenced against CP in June 2015 in Texas (on behalf of Lac-M\u00e9gantic residents and wrongful death representatives) and the wrongful death and personal injury actions commenced against CP in June 2015 in Illinois and Maine, were all transferred and consolidated in Federal District Court in Maine (the \u201cMaine Actions\u201d). The Maine Actions allege that CP negligently misclassified and improperly packaged the petroleum crude oil. On CP\u2019s motion, the Maine Actions were dismissed. The plaintiffs are appealing the dismissal decision, which is pending.\n(8)The trustee for the wrongful death trust commenced Carmack Amendment claims against CP in North Dakota Federal Court, seeking to recover approximately U.S. $6 million for damaged rail cars and lost crude and reimbursement for the settlement paid by the consignor and the consignee under the Plans (alleged to be U.S. $110 million and U.S. $60 million, respectively). The Court issued an Order on August 6, 2020 granting and denying in parts the parties' summary judgment motions which has been reviewed and confirmed following motions by the parties for clarification and reconsideration. This action is scheduled for trial on September 21, 2021.\nAt this stage of the proceedings, any potential responsibility and the quantum of potential losses cannot be determined. Nevertheless, CP denies liability and is vigorously defending these proceedings.\n26. Guarantees\nIn the normal course of operating the railway, the Company enters into contractual arrangements that involve providing certain guarantees, which extend over the term of the contracts. These guarantees include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022guarantees to pay other parties in the event of the occurrence of specified events, including damage to equipment, in relation to assets used in the operation of the railway through operating leases, rental agreements, easements, trackage, and interline agreements; and\n\u2022indemnifications of certain tax-related payments incurred by lessors and lenders.\nThe maximum amount that could be payable under these guarantees, excluding residual value guarantees, cannot be reasonably estimated due to the nature of certain of these guarantees. All or a portion of amounts paid under guarantees to other parties in the event of the occurrence of specified events could be recoverable from other parties or through insurance. The Company has accrued for all guarantees that it expects to pay. At December 31, 2020, these accruals amounted to $18 million (2019 - $10 million), and are recorded in \u201cAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\".\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 122\nIndemnifications\nPursuant to a trust and custodial services agreement with the trustee of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company Pension Plan, the Company has undertaken to indemnify and save harmless the trustee, to the extent not paid by the fund, from any and all taxes, claims, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses arising out of the performance of the trustee\u2019s obligations under the agreement, except as a result of misconduct by the trustee. The indemnity includes liabilities, costs, or expenses relating to any legal reporting or notification obligations of the trustee with respect to the defined benefit and defined contribution options of the pension plans, or otherwise with respect to the assets of the pension plans that are not part of the fund. The indemnity survives the termination or expiry of the agreement with respect to claims and liabilities arising prior to the termination or expiry. At December 31, 2020, the Company had not recorded a liability associated with this indemnification as it does not expect to make any payments pertaining to it.\n27. Segmented and geographic information\nOperating segment\nThe Company operates in only one operating segment: rail transportation. Operating results by geographic areas, railway corridors, or other lower-level components or units of operation are not reviewed by the Company\u2019s chief operating decision-maker to make decisions about the allocation of resources to, or the assessment of performance of, such geographic areas, corridors, components, or units of operation.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, no one customer comprised more than 10% of total revenues and accounts receivable.\nGeographic information\nAll of the company's revenue and long-lived assets excluding financial instruments are held within Canada and the United States.\n28.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2020, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of CP's management, including CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that they file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for the financial statements and for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Corporation\u2019s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Corporation\u2019s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Deloitte LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm who audited the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company has not identified any changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nCP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 124\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Canadian Pacific Railway Limited\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Canadian Pacific Railway Limited and subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated February 18, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte LLP\nChartered Professional Accountants\nCalgary, Canada\nFebruary 18, 2021\n125 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT",
