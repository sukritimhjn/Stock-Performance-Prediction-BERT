    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. If any of such events should occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. Additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectus supplements related to offerings of our securities from time to time in the future.\nRISKS RELATED TO PRICING, DEMAND, AND PRODUCTION FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS (NGLs)\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations, the global economy, and the demand for and prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs. The unprecedented nature of the current situation makes it impossible for the Company to identify all potential risks related to the pandemic or estimate the ultimate adverse impact that the pandemic may have on its business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by third parties, including, but not limited to, governmental authorities, businesses, and consumers, in response to the pandemic have adversely impacted the global economy and created significant volatility in the global financial markets. Business closures, restrictions on travel, \u201cstay-at-home\u201d or \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, and other restrictions on movement within and among communities have significantly reduced demand for and the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs. As of the date of this report, efforts to contain COVID-19 have not been successful in many regions, vaccination programs have encountered delays, and the global pandemic remains ongoing. A continued prolonged period of such reduced demand, the failure to timely distribute or the ineffectiveness of any vaccines, the failure to develop adequate treatments, and other adverse impacts from the pandemic may materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely on its workforce being able to access its wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with its oil and gas leases. Additionally, because the Company has implemented remote working procedures for a significant portion of its workforce for health and safety reasons and/or to comply with applicable national, state, and/or local government requirements, the Company relies on such persons having sufficient access to its information technology systems, including through telecommunication hardware, software, and networks. If a significant portion of the Company\u2019s workforce cannot effectively perform their responsibilities, whether resulting from a lack of physical or virtual access, quarantines, illnesses, governmental actions or restrictions, information technology or telecommunication failures, or other restrictions or adverse impacts resulting from the pandemic, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe unprecedented nature of the current situation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic makes it impossible for the Company to identify all potential risks related to the pandemic or estimate the ultimate adverse impact that the pandemic may have on its business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. Such results will depend on future events, which the Company cannot predict, including the scope, duration, and potential reoccurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other localized epidemic or global pandemic, the distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the demand for and the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs, and the actions taken by third parties, including, but not limited to, governmental authorities, customers, contractors, and suppliers, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or any other epidemics or pandemics. The COVID-19 pandemic and its unprecedented consequences have amplified, and may continue to amplify, the other risks identified in this report.\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGL price volatility could adversely affect our operating results and the price of our common stock.\nOur revenues, operating results, and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production. Historically, the markets for these commodities have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. For example, the NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2020 ranged from a high of $63.27 per barrel to a low of -$36.98 per barrel. The NYMEX daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2020 ranged from a high of $3.14 per MMBtu to a low of $1.33 per MMBtu. The market prices for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs depend on factors beyond our control. These factors include demand, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including:\n\u2022worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs;\n\u2022actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations, including the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC);\n\u2022political conditions and events (including instability, changes in governments, or armed conflict) in oil and gas producing regions;\n\u2022the occurrence of global events such as epidemics or pandemics (including, specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic) and the actions taken by third parties, including, but not limited to, governmental authorities, customers, contractors, and suppliers, in response to such epidemics or pandemics;\n\u2022the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022the price and level of imported foreign crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal and biofuels;\n\u2022the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure;\n\u2022the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity;\n\u2022weather conditions;\n\u2022domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and\n\u2022the overall economic environment.\nOur results of operations, as well as the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, are substantially dependent upon the prices of oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Despite slight increases in oil and natural gas prices in 2020, prices have remained significantly lower than levels seen in recent years, which has adversely affected our revenues, operating income, cash flow, and proved reserves. Continued low prices could have a material adverse impact on our operations and limit our ability to fund capital expenditures. Without the ability to fund capital expenditures, we would be unable to replace reserves and production. Sustained low prices of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs may further adversely impact our business as follows:\n\u2022weakening our financial condition and reducing our liquidity;\n\u2022limiting our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations;\n\u2022reducing the amount of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we can produce economically;\n\u2022causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects;\n\u2022reducing our revenues, operating income, and cash flows;\n\u2022limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt;\n\u2022reducing the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, resulting in additional non-cash impairments; or\n\u2022reducing the carrying value of our gathering, processing, and transmission facilities, resulting in additional impairments.\nOur ability to sell crude oil, natural gas, or NGLs and/or receive market prices for these commodities and/or meet volume commitments under transportation services agreements may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints, the inability to procure and resell volumes economically, and various transportation interruptions.\nA portion of our crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production in any region may be interrupted, limited, or shut in from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems, processing facilities, or interstate pipelines to transport our production, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flows. Additionally, if we are unable to procure and resell third-party volumes at or above a net price that covers the cost of transportation, our cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe may not realize an adequate return on wells that we drill.\nDrilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. The costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022unexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022pressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022equipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering;\n\u2022marine risks, such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes;\n\u2022other adverse weather conditions; and\n\u2022increases in the cost of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and equipment.\nFuture drilling activities may not be successful, and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.\nOur commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks.\nTo the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u2022our production falls short of the hedged volumes;\n\u2022there is a widening of price-basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement;\n\u2022the counterparties to our hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; or\n\u2022an unexpected event materially impacts commodity prices.\nRISKS RELATED TO OPERATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS\nOur operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage to or loss of equipment, and environmental accidents.\nOur operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production, and transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, including:\n\u2022well blowouts, explosions, and cratering;\n\u2022pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills;\n\u2022fires;\n\u2022formations with abnormal pressures;\n\u2022equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022hurricanes, storms, and/or cyclones, which could affect our operations in areas such as on and offshore the Gulf Coast, North Sea, and Suriname, and other natural and anthropogenic disasters and weather conditions; and\n\u2022surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents, saltwater, or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives.\nFailure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyberattacks, or natural disasters such as hurricanes, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution, and other damages for which we could be liable. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a well blowout, explosion, fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, or ground water contamination from hydraulic fracturing chemical additives may result in substantial claims for damages. Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses. If a significant amount of our production is interrupted, our containment efforts prove to be ineffective, or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWeather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and production.\nDemand for oil and gas are, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impact the price we receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as freezing temperatures, hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, or storms in the North Sea, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. Our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated, or insured against.\nOur insurance policies do not cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure.\nExploration for and production of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts, cratering, fires, explosions, and loss of well control, which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property or the environment. Our international operations are also subject to political risk. The insurance coverage that we maintain against certain losses or liabilities arising from our operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability; moreover, insurance is not available to us against all operational risks.\nA terrorist or cyberattack targeting systems and infrastructure used by us or others in the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, communicate with our employees and third-party partners, and conduct many of our activities. Unauthorized access to our digital technology could lead to operational disruption, data corruption, communication interruption, loss of intellectual property, loss of confidential and fiduciary data, and loss or corruption of reserves or other proprietary information. Also, external digital technologies control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution and refining systems in the United States and abroad, which are necessary to transport and market our production. A cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. Any such terrorist attack, environmental activist group activity, or cyberattack that affects the Company or our customers, suppliers, or others with whom we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause us to incur a material financial loss, subject us to possible legal claims and liability, and/or damage our reputation.\nWhile certain of our insurance policies may allow for coverage of associated damages resulting from such events, if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur.\nWhile we have experienced cyberattacks in the past, we have not suffered any material losses as a result of such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Further, as cyberattacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. In addition, cyberattacks against us or others in our industry could result in additional regulations, which could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs, insurance coverage cost, or capital expenditures. The Company cannot predict the potential impact that such additional regulations could have on our business and operations or the energy industry at large.\nMaterial differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects.\nWe are involved in several large development projects, and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates. Our projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners, timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies, weather conditions, manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment, and other unforeseen events. Delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect our large development projects and our ability to participate in large-scale development projects in the future. In addition, our estimates of future development costs are based on our current expectations of prices and other costs of equipment and personnel we will need to implement such projects. Our actual future development costs may be significantly higher than we currently estimate. If costs become too high, our development projects may become uneconomic to us, and we may be forced to abandon such development projects.\nRISKS RELATED TO RESERVES AND LEASEHOLD ACREAGE\nDiscoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production.\nThe production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, while related per-unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Therefore, unless we add reserves through exploration and development activities, identify additional behind-pipe zones, secondary recovery reserves, or tertiary recovery reserves through engineering studies, or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, our estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced. Future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. Furthermore, if oil or gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase.\nWe may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves.\nAlthough we perform a review of properties that we acquire that we believe is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. It generally is not feasible to review in-depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily, we will focus our review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample the remainder. However, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. In addition, there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing operations.\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves and their value. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Because of the high degree of judgment involved, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation. Our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices, except where contractual arrangements exist; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. In addition, results of drilling, testing, and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time. The estimates of our proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including:\n\u2022historical production from the area compared with production from other areas;\n\u2022the effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including changes to severance and excise taxes;\n\u2022future operating costs and capital expenditures; and\n\u2022workover and remediation costs.\nFor these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves, and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue, and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates.\nAdditionally, because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. Volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. In addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. A change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\nA sizeable portion of our acreage is currently undeveloped. Unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. Our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, commodity prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals.\nRISKS RELATED TO COUNTERPARTIES\nThe credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nWe are party to numerous transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, other investment funds, and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit or financial markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We may also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with any hedges. We also have exposure to insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies. In addition, if any lender under our credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender\u2019s commitment under our credit facilities.\nWe are exposed to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. This risk of counterparty non-performance is of particular concern given the recent volatility of the financial markets and significant decline in commodity prices, which could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty\u2019s liquidity and impair its ability to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty\u2019s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our hedge providers or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to us by the distressed entity or entities. During periods of falling commodity prices, our hedge receivable positions increase, which increases our exposure. If the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.\nThe distressed financial conditions of our purchasers and partners could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or to reimburse us for their share of costs.\nConcerns about global economic conditions and the volatility of oil, natural gas, and NGL prices have had a significant adverse impact on the oil and gas industry. We are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables. We sell our crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs to a variety of purchasers. As operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. As a result of current economic conditions and the severe decline in commodity prices, some of our customers and non-operating partners may experience severe financial problems that may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness. We cannot provide assurance that one or more of our financially distressed customers or non-operating partners will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, future results of operations, or future cash flows. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our customers or non-operating partners or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by\nthe distressed entity or entities. Nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.\nOur liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of our transaction counterparties become the subject of a bankruptcy case.\nFrom time to time we have divested noncore or nonstrategic domestic and international assets. The agreements relating to these transactions contain provisions pursuant to which liabilities related to past and future operations have been allocated between the parties by means of liability assumptions, indemnities, escrows, trusts, and similar arrangements. One of the most significant of these liabilities involves the decommissioning of wells and facilities previously owned by us. One or more of the counterparties in these transactions could fail to perform its obligations under these agreements as a result of financial distress. In the event that any such counterparty were to become the subject of a case or proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law (which we collectively refer to as Insolvency Laws), the counterparty may not perform its obligations under the agreements related to these transactions. In that case, our remedy in the proceeding would be a claim for damages for the breach of the contractual arrangements, which may be either a secured claim or an unsecured claim depending on whether or not we have collateral from the counterparty for the performance of the obligations. Resolution of our claim for damages in such a proceeding may be delayed, and we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of the obligations assumed by the counterparties under such agreements should they arise, pending final resolution of the proceeding.\nDespite the provisions in our agreements requiring purchasers of our state or federal leasehold interests to assume certain liabilities and obligations related to such interests, if a purchaser of such interests becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant Insolvency Laws or becomes unable financially to perform such liabilities or obligations, we would expect the relevant governmental authorities to require us to perform and hold us responsible for such liabilities and obligations. In such event, we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.\nIf a court or a governmental authority were to make any of the foregoing determinations or take any of the foregoing actions, or any similar determination or action, it could adversely impact our cash flows, operations, or financial condition.\nWe do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements, and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations.\nWe conduct many of our exploration and production (E&P) operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not an operator under the agreement. There is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and therefore, decisions may be made that we do not believe are in our best interest. Moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations, and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. In either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected.\nWe own an approximate 79 percent interest in Altus, which holds substantially all of our former gathering, processing and transmission assets in Alpine High. Altus may be subject to different risks than those described in this Form 10-K.\nWe own an approximate 79 percent interest in Altus, which holds substantially all of our former gathering, processing and transmission assets in Alpine High. Altus owns, develops, and operates a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas, anchored by midstream service contracts to service our production from our Alpine High resource play. Altus generates revenue by providing fee-based natural gas gathering, compression, processing, and transmission services and through its Equity Method Interest Pipelines. Given the nature of its business, Altus may be subject to different and additional risks than those described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a description of these risks, refer to Altus\u2019 most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\nRISKS RELATED TO CAPITAL MARKETS\nA downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.\nWe receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, commodity pricing levels, and other factors are also considered by the rating agencies. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of future debt. During 2020, our credit rating was downgraded by Moody\u2019s to Ba1/Negative and by Standard and Poor\u2019s to BB+/Negative. These and other past ratings downgrades have required, and any future downgrades may require, us to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations.\nMarket conditions may restrict our ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs, which may limit our financial flexibility.\nThe financial markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable shocks. We have a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio, which will require substantial future investment. We and/or our partners may need to seek financing in order to fund these or other future activities. Our future access to capital, as well as that of our partners and contractors, could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained. This could significantly delay development of our property interests.\nOur syndicated credit facility currently matures in March 2024. There is no assurance of the terms upon which potential lenders under future agreements will make loans or other extensions of credit available to Apache or its subsidiaries or the composition of such lenders.\nThe discontinuation and uncertain cessation date of LIBOR, and the adoption of an alternative reference rate, may have a material adverse impact on our floating rate indebtedness and financing costs.\nPursuant to the terms of our revolving credit facility (1) we may elect to use London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate on floating interest rate borrowings and (2) the commission payable to the lenders on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit uses LIBOR as a benchmark. On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) announced that it intends to continue publishing LIBOR until the end of June 2023, beyond the previously announced 2021 cessation date. The IBA announcement was supported by announcements from the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (U.S. Regulators). However, both the FCA and U.S. Regulators in their announcements also advised banks to cease entering into new contracts referencing LIBOR after December 2021. These announcements indicate that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis may not be assured after 2021 and will not be assured beyond 2023. In light of these recent announcements, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain, and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR\u2019s phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist.\nIn the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the working group formed to recommend an alternative rate to LIBOR) has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. There can be no guarantee that SOFR will become a widely-accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR. Although the full impact of the transition away from LIBOR, including the discontinuance of LIBOR publication and the adoption of SOFR as the replacement rate for LIBOR, remains unclear, these changes may have an adverse impact on our floating rate indebtedness and financing costs under our revolving credit facility.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations.\nThe payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations, and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. Our board of directors is not required to declare dividends on our common stock and may decide not to declare dividends.\nAny indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends on capital stock may only be paid from \u201csurplus,\u201d which is the amount by which the fair value of our total assets exceeds the sum of our total liabilities, including contingent liabilities, and the amount of our capital; if there is no surplus, cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid\nfrom our net profits for the then-current and/or the preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL RESULTS\nFuture economic conditions in the U.S. and certain international markets may materially adversely impact our operating results.\nCurrent global market conditions and uncertainty, including the economic instability in Europe and certain emerging markets, are likely to have significant long-term effects on our operating results. Global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. A lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for our oil and gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which would reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability.\nWe face strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.\nStrong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas E&P industry. We compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisitions of oil and gas leases, properties, and reserves, equipment and labor required to explore, develop, and operate those properties, and marketing of crude oil, natural gas, and NGL production. Crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess and have established strategic, long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production, such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels, and the application of government regulations. We also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other specialists. These competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to utilize net operating losses and other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income may be limited if the Company experiences an ownership change.\nAs described in Note 10-Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) and other tax attributes available to potentially offset future taxable income. If the Company were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change, by value, in the Company\u2019s equity ownership by five-percent shareholders over a three-year period, the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to potentially offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. Such a limitation could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results or cash flows by effectively increasing its future tax obligations.\nRISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION AND POLITICAL RISKS\nWe may incur significant costs related to environmental matters.\nAs an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into and protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution cleanup and other remediation activities resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages, limit or constrain operations in affected areas, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Our efforts to limit our exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to our results of operations. In addition, it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital expenditures. Such capital expenditures could adversely impact our cash flows and our financial condition.\nOur United States operations are subject to governmental risks.\nOur United States operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state, and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering rate controls, and environmental protection laws and regulations.\nIn response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 and as directed by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) issued guidelines and regulations regarding safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment, and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. These regulations imposed additional requirements and caused delays with respect to development and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico.\nWith respect to oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico, the BOEM issued a Notice to Lessees (NTL No. 2016-N01) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies\u2019 oil and gas leases. While the NTL was paused in mid-2017 and is currently listed on BOEM\u2019s website as \u201crescinded,\u201d if reinstated, the NTL will likely require that Apache provide additional security to BOEM with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to Apache\u2019s current ownership interests in various Gulf of Mexico leases. We are working closely with BOEM to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the NTL. Additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which Apache has sold Gulf of Mexico assets or with whom Apache has joint ownership. Such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties\u2019 solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.\nNew political developments, the enactment of new or stricter laws or regulations or other governmental actions impacting our United States operations, and increased liability for companies operating in this sector may adversely impact our results of operations.\nChanges to existing regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact our business.\nCertain countries where we operate, including the United Kingdom, either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas (GHG) related fees on our operations. Exposure has not been material to date, although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Additionally, there has been discussion in other countries where we operate, including the United States, regarding legislation or regulation of GHG. Any such legislation or regulation, if enacted, could either tax or assess some form of GHG-related fees on our operations and could lead to increased operating expenses or cause us to make significant capital investments for infrastructure modifications.\nIn the event the predictions for rising temperatures and sea levels suggested by reports of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change do transpire, we do not believe those events by themselves are likely to impact our assets or operations. However, any increase in severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our assets and operations.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines, and enforcement interpretations. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens, and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance, and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.\nChanges in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA) was signed into law. In addition to reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018, certain provisions in the TCJA move the U.S. away from a worldwide tax system and closer to a territorial system for earnings of foreign corporations, establishing a participation exemption system for taxation of foreign income. The new law includes a transition rule to effect this participation exemption regime. The TCJA also includes provisions which could impact or limit the Company\u2019s ability to deduct interest expense or utilize net operating losses.\nThe U.S. federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and gas exploration, development, and extraction may be further modified by administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. Previous legislative proposals, if enacted into law, could make significant changes to such laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. The passage or adoption of these changes, or similar changes, could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be enacted. Any such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nProposed federal, state, or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our operating and capital costs.\nSeveral proposals are before the U.S. Congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Several states and political subdivisions are considering legislation, ballot initiatives, executive orders, or other actions to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to induced seismicity. In addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so. We routinely use fracturing techniques in the U.S. and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore. It is typically done at substantial depths in formations with low permeability.\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the governmental actions regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal, state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the U.S.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS\nInternational operations have uncertain political, economic, and other risks.\nOur operations outside the United States are based primarily in Egypt and the United Kingdom. On a barrel equivalent basis, approximately 42 percent of our 2020 production was outside the United States, and approximately 33 percent of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2020, were located outside the United States. As a result, a significant portion of our production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations including, but not limited to:\n\u2022general strikes and civil unrest;\n\u2022the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation and resource nationalization, and forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;\n\u2022import and export regulations;\n\u2022taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;\n\u2022price control;\n\u2022transportation regulations and tariffs;\n\u2022constrained oil or natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area;\n\u2022exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluations, or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds;\n\u2022laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, including trade sanctions;\n\u2022the effects of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, including any resulting instability in global financial markets or the value of foreign currencies such as the British pound;\n\u2022the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we currently operate;\n\u2022the possible inability to subject foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations.\nForeign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes. If a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or be lost. Even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management\u2019s attention from our more significant assets. Certain regions of the world in which we operate have a history of political and economic instability. This instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as ours. In an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of our assets. This could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability.\nThe impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities, as have occurred in countries and regions in which we operate, may have on the oil and gas industry in general and on our operations in particular is not known at this time. Uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, and refineries, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. We may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities.\nA deterioration of conditions in Egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in Egypt could have an adverse impact on our business.\nDeterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with EGPC, or threats or acts of terrorism could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our operations in Egypt, excluding the impacts of a one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed 20 percent of our 2020 production and accounted for 15 percent of our year-end estimated proved reserves and 24 percent of our estimated discounted future net cash flows.\nOur operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations.\nOur operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the British pound. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE PLANNED HOLDING COMPANY REORGANIZATION\nIf the Holding Company Reorganization is implemented, APA Corporation, as the parent holding company of Apache, will be dependent on the operations and funds of its subsidiaries, including Apache.\nIf the Holding Company Reorganization is implemented, APA Corporation will become the successor issuer to, and parent holding company of, Apache. APA Corporation will have no business operations of its own. APA Corporation\u2019s only significant assets will be the outstanding equity interests of its subsidiaries, including Apache. As a result, APA Corporation will rely on cash flows from Apache to pay dividends with respect to its common stock and to meet its financial obligations, including to service any debt obligations that APA Corporation may incur from time to time. Legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing future indebtedness of Apache, as well as Apache\u2019s financial condition and future operating\nrequirements, may limit Apache\u2019s ability to distribute cash to APA Corporation. If Apache is limited in its ability to distribute cash to APA Corporation, or if Apache\u2019s earnings or other available assets of are not sufficient to pay distributions or make loans to APA Corporation in the amounts or at the times necessary for APA Corporation to pay dividends with respect to its common stock and/or to meet its financial obligations, then APA Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, and reputation may be materially adversely affected.\nIf the Holding Company Reorganization is implemented, APA Corporation may not obtain the anticipated benefits of the reorganization into a holding company structure.\nIf the Holding Company Reorganization is implemented, we believe that our new operating structure will allow us to focus on running our diverse businesses independently with the goal of maximizing each of the business\u2019 potential. However, the anticipated benefits of the planned Holding Company Reorganization may not be obtained if circumstances prevent us from taking advantage of the strategic and business opportunities that we expect it may afford us. As a result, we may incur the costs of a holding company structure without realizing the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nManagement is dedicating significant effort to the new operating structure. These efforts may divert management\u2019s focus and resources from the Company\u2019s operations, strategic initiatives, or development opportunities, which could adversely affect our prospects, business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nCertain anti-takeover provisions in our charter and Delaware law could delay or prevent a hostile takeover.\nOur charter authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to determine the voting rights and dividend rights, dividend rates, liquidation preferences, conversion rights, redemption rights, including sinking fund provisions and redemption prices, and other terms and rights of each series of preferred stock. In addition, Delaware law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock. These provisions may deter hostile takeover attempts that could result in an acquisition of us that would have been financially beneficial to our shareholders.",

    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas, and NGL prices, interest rates, or foreign currency and adverse governmental actions. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures.\nCommodity Price Risk\nThe Company\u2019s revenues, earnings, cash flow, capital investments and, ultimately, future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices the Company receives for its crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, which have historically been very volatile because of unpredictable events such as economic growth or retraction, weather, political climate, and global supply and demand. These factors have only been heightened as the result of continuing negative demand implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company continually monitors its market risk exposure, including the impact and developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which introduced significant volatility in the financial markets subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe Company\u2019s average crude oil realizations decreased 34 percent to $39.60 per barrel in 2020 from $60.05 per barrel in 2019. The Company\u2019s average natural gas price realizations decreased 4 percent to $1.83 per Mcf in 2020 from $1.90 per Mcf in 2019. The Company\u2019s average NGL realizations decreased 25 percent to $11.84 per barrel in 2020 from $15.74 per barrel in 2019. Based on average daily production for 2020, a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized oil price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately $78 million, a $0.10 per Mcf change in the weighted average realized price of natural gas would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately $33 million, and a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized NGL price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately $28 million.\nApache periodically enters into derivative positions on a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices. Such derivative positions may include the use of futures contracts, swaps, and/or options. Apache does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had open natural gas derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges in an asset position with a fair value of $11 million. The impact of a 10 percent movement in natural gas prices would be immaterial to the fair value of the commodity derivatives. These fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at December 31, 2020. See Note 4-Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report Form 10-K for notional volumes and terms with the Company\u2019s derivative contracts.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAt December 31, 2020, Apache had approximately $8.1 billion net carrying value of notes and debentures outstanding, all of which was fixed-rate debt, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.98 percent. Although near-term changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of Apache\u2019s fixed-rate debt, they do not expose the Company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss associated with that debt. Apache is also exposed to interest rate risk related to its interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents balances and amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program and credit facilities. As of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $262 million, approximately 46 percent of which was invested in money market funds and short-term investments with major financial institutions. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had credit facility borrowings of $150 million and $624 million under its Apache and Altus credit facilities, respectively. A change in the interest rate applicable to the Company\u2019s short-term investments and credit facility borrowings would have an immaterial impact on earnings and cash flows but could impact interest costs associated with future debt issuances or any future borrowings under its commercial paper program, revolving credit facilities, and money market lines of credit.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company\u2019s cash activities relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. The Company\u2019s North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. In Egypt, substantially all oil and gas production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of the costs incurred are denominated in U.S. dollars. Transactions denominated in British pounds are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the average exchange rates during the period.\nForeign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month. Currency gains and losses are included as either a component of \u201cOther\u201d under \u201cRevenues and Other\u201d or, as is the case when the Company re-measures its foreign tax liabilities, as a component of the Company\u2019s provision for income tax expense on the statement of consolidated operations. A foreign currency net gain or loss of $5 million would result from a 10 percent weakening or strengthening, respectively, in the British pound as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company is subject to increased foreign currency risk associated with the effects of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union. Apache has periodically entered into foreign exchange contracts in order to minimize the impact of fluctuating exchange rates for the British pound on the Company\u2019s operating expenses. The Company had no outstanding foreign exchange derivative contracts as of December 31, 2020.",

The financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include amounts that are based on management\u2019s best estimates and judgments.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written code of business conduct adopted by our Company\u2019s board of directors, applicable to all Company directors and all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company\u2019s independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of the Company\u2019s board of directors. Ernst & Young LLP have audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries and the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the independent auditors follow this report on pages and.\n/s/ John J. Christmann IV\nChief Executive Officer and President\n(principal executive officer)\n/s/ Stephen J.

Hoyt\nSenior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller\n(principal accounting officer)\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 25, 2021\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apache Corporation:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Apache Corporation and subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Apache Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related statements of consolidated operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and changes in equity and noncontrolling interest for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated February 25, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 25, 2021\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apache Corporation:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related statements of consolidated operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and changes in equity and noncontrolling interest for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 25, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization and impairment of property and equipment\nDescription of\nthe Matter At December 31, 2020, the carrying value of the Company\u2019s property and equipment was $8,819 million, and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense was $1,772 million, and impairment expense was $4,501 million for the year then ended. As described in Note 1, the Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties. DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method based on proved oil and gas reserves, as estimated by the Company\u2019s internal reservoir engineers. When circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property and equipment may not be recoverable, the Company compares unamortized capitalized costs to the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows for the associated assets. If the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value.\nProved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Additionally, the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes from estimated oil and gas reserves. Significant judgment is required by the Company\u2019s internal reservoir engineers in evaluating geological and engineering data when estimating oil and gas reserves. Estimating reserves also requires the selection of inputs, including oil and gas price assumptions, future operating and capital costs assumptions, and tax rates by jurisdiction, among others. Because of the complexity involved in estimating oil and gas reserves, management engaged independent petroleum engineers to audit the proved oil and gas reserve estimates prepared by the Company\u2019s internal reservoir engineers for select properties as of December 31, 2020.\nAuditing the Company\u2019s DD&A and impairment calculations is complex because of the use of the work of the internal reservoir engineers and the independent petroleum engineers and the evaluation of management\u2019s determination of the inputs described above used by the engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves.\nHow We\nAddressed the\nMatter in Our\nAudit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company\u2019s controls over its process to calculate DD&A and impairment, including management\u2019s controls over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data provided to the engineers for use in estimating oil and gas reserves.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company\u2019s internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimates and the independent petroleum engineers used to audit the proved oil and gas reserve estimates for select properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the financial data and inputs described above used by the engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. For proved undeveloped reserves, we evaluated management\u2019s development plan for compliance with the SEC rule that undrilled locations are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time, by assessing consistency of the development projections with the Company\u2019s development plan and the availability of capital relative to the development plan. We also tested the mathematical accuracy of the DD&A and impairment calculations, including comparing the oil and gas reserve amounts used in the calculations to the Company\u2019s reserve reports.\nAccounting for asset retirement obligation for the North Sea segment\nDescription of\nthe Matter\nAt December 31, 2020, the asset retirement obligation (ARO) balance totaled $1,944 million. As further described in Note 8, the Company\u2019s ARO reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with the Company\u2019s oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets. The estimation of the ARO related to the North Sea segment requires significant judgment given the magnitude of the expected retirement costs and higher estimation uncertainty related to the timing of settlements and settlement amounts.\nAuditing the Company\u2019s ARO for the North Sea segment is complex and highly judgmental because of the significant estimation required by management in determining the obligation. In particular, the estimate was sensitive to significant subjective assumptions such as retirement cost estimates and the estimated timing of settlements, which are both affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions.\nHow We\nAddressed the\nMatter in Our\nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal controls over its ARO estimation process, including management\u2019s review of the significant assumptions that have a material effect on the determination of the obligations. We also tested management\u2019s controls over the completeness and accuracy of financial data used in the valuation.\nTo test the ARO for the North Sea segment, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the significant assumptions and inputs used in the valuation, such as retirement cost estimates and timing of settlement assumptions. For example, we evaluated retirement cost estimates by comparing the Company\u2019s estimates to recent offshore activities and costs. Additionally, we compared assumptions for the timing of settlements to production forecasts. We also involved our internal specialists in testing the underlying retirement cost estimates.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2002.\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 25, 2021\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSTATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS\nThe accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSTATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nThe accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSTATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS\nThe accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET\nThe accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSTATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED CHANGES IN EQUITY (DEFICIT) AND NONCONTROLLING INTEREST\nThe accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNature of Operations\nApache Corporation (Apache or the Company) is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. The Company\u2019s upstream business has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the United States (U.S.), Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). Apache also has active exploration and planned appraisal operations ongoing in Suriname, as well as interests in other international locations that may, over time, result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities. Apache\u2019s midstream business is operated by Altus Midstream Company (Nasdaq: ALTM) through its subsidiary Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus). Altus owns, develops, and operates a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas.\nOn January 4, 2021, Apache announced that its Board of Directors authorized the Company to proceed with the implementation of a holding company reorganization, in connection with which, Apache will create APA Corporation, a new holding company (APA). Upon completion of the holding company reorganization, Apache will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of APA, APA will be the successor issuer to Apache pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange, and APA will replace Apache as the public company trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol \u201cAPA\u201d (the Holding Company Reorganization). The Holding Company Reorganization has not yet been implemented, but it is expected to be completed during the first half of 2021.\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAccounting policies used by Apache and its subsidiaries reflect industry practices and conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The Company\u2019s financial statements for prior periods include reclassifications that were made to conform to the current-year presentation. Significant accounting policies are discussed below.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apache and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. The Company\u2019s undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships are proportionately consolidated.\nThe Company consolidates all other investments in which, either through direct or indirect ownership, it has more than a 50 percent voting interest or controls the financial and operating decisions. Noncontrolling interests represent third-party ownership in the net assets of a consolidated subsidiary of Apache and are reflected separately in the Company\u2019s financial statements. Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) owns a one-third minority participation in Apache\u2019s Egypt oil and gas business as a noncontrolling interest, which is reflected as a separate component of equity in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet.\nAdditionally, third-party investors own a minority interest of approximately 21 percent of Altus Midstream Company (ALTM), which is reflected as a separate noncontrolling interest component of equity in Apache\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. ALTM qualifies as a variable interest entity (VIE) under GAAP. Apache consolidates the activities of ALTM because it has concluded that it has a controlling financial interest in ALTM and is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. On June 12, 2019, Altus Midstream LP issued and sold Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the Preferred Units) through a private offering that admitted additional limited partners with separate rights for the Preferred Unit holders. Refer to Note 13-Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest - Altus for further detail.\nInvestments in which the Company holds less than 50 percent of the voting interest are typically accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with the balance recorded separately as \u201cEquity method interests\u201d in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet and as a component of \u201cOther\u201d under \u201cRevenues and Other\u201d in the Company\u2019s statement of consolidated operations. Refer to Note 6-Equity Method Interests for further detail.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. Significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include the estimates of fair value for long-lived assets (see \u201cFair Value Measurements\u201d and \u201cProperty and Equipment\u201d sections in this Note 1 below), the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities (see Note 2-Acquisitions and Divestitures), the assessment of asset retirement obligations (see Note 8-Asset Retirement Obligation), the estimate of income taxes (see Note 10-Income Taxes), and the estimate of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom (see Note 18-Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited)).\nFair Value Measurements\nCertain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a recurring basis in Apache\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820-10-35, \u201cFair Value Measurement\u201d (ASC 820), provides a hierarchy that prioritizes and defines the types of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs, which consist of unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 inputs consist of quoted prices for similar instruments. Level 3 valuations are derived from inputs that are significant and unobservable; hence, these valuations have the lowest priority.\nThe valuation techniques that may be used to measure fair value include a market approach, an income approach, and a cost approach. A market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. An income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations, including present value techniques, option-pricing models, and the excess earnings method. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).\nRecurring fair value measurements are presented in further detail in Note 4-Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, Note 9-Debt and Financing Costs, Note 12-Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans, and Note 13-Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest - Altus.\nThe Company also uses fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis when certain qualitative assessments of its assets indicate a potential impairment. The following table presents a summary of asset impairments recorded in connection with fair value assessments:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling $4.5 billion in connection with fair value assessments.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nGiven the crude oil price collapse on lower demand and economic activity resulting from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic and related governmental actions, the Company assessed its oil and gas property and gathering, processing, and transmission (GPT) facilities for impairment based on the net book value of its assets as of March 31, 2020. The Company recorded proved property impairments totaling $3.9 billion, $354 million, and $7 million in the U.S., Egypt, and North Sea, respectively, all of which were impaired to their estimated fair values as a result of lower forecasted commodity prices, changes to planned development activity, and increasing market uncertainty. Impairments totaling $68 million were similarly recorded for GPT facilities in Egypt. These impairments are discussed in further detail below in \u201cProperty and Equipment - Oil and Gas Property\u201d and \u201cProperty and Equipment - Gathering, Processing, and Transmission Facilities.\u201d\nThe Company also performed an interim impairment analysis of the goodwill related to its Egypt reporting unit. Reductions in estimated net present value of expected future cash flows from oil and gas properties resulted in implied fair values below the carrying values of the Company\u2019s Egypt reporting unit. As a result of these assessments, the Company recognized non-cash impairments of the entire amount of recorded goodwill in the Egypt reporting unit of $87 million in the first quarter of 2020.\nDuring the remainder of 2020, the Company recorded additional proved property impairments totaling $20 million in Egypt, as well as $13 million for the early termination of drilling rig leases, $5 million for inventory revaluations, and $9 million of other asset impairments, all in the U.S.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, following a material reduction to planned investment in Apache\u2019s Alpine High development, the Company recorded impairments totaling $1.4 billion for its Alpine High proved properties and upstream infrastructure which were written down to their fair values. Altus separately assessed its long-lived infrastructure assets for impairment based on expected reductions to future throughput volumes from Alpine High. Altus subsequently recorded impairments totaling $1.3 billion on its GPT facilities. These impairments are discussed in further detail below in \u201cProperty and Equipment - Oil and Gas Property\u201d and \u201cProperty and Equipment - Gathering, Processing, and Transmission Facilities.\u201d\nSeparate from the Company\u2019s Alpine High and Altus impairments, Apache entered into agreements to sell certain of its assets in the western Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and Texas. As a result of these agreements, a separate impairment analysis was performed for each of the assets within the disposal groups. The analyses were based on the agreed-upon proceeds less costs to sell for the transaction, a Level 1 fair value measurement. The carrying value of the net assets to be divested exceeded the fair value implied by the expected net proceeds, resulting in impairments in the second and fourth quarters of 2019 totaling $255 million, including $101 million on the Company\u2019s proved properties, $149 million on its unproved properties, and $5 million on other working capital. For more information regarding this transaction, refer to Note 2-Acquisitions and Divestitures.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded asset impairments totaling $511 million in connection with fair value assessments. Impairments totaling $328 million and $56 million were recorded for proved properties, and a gathering and processing facility in Oklahoma, respectively, which were written down to their fair values associated with U.S. assets to be divested. During the third quarter of 2018, Apache agreed to sell certain of its unproved properties offshore the U.K. in the North Sea. As a result, the Company performed a fair value assessment of the properties and recorded a $10 million impairment on the carrying values of the associated capitalized exploratory well costs. The fair value of the impaired assets was determined using the negotiated sales price, a Level 1 fair value measurement. Also in 2018, the Company recorded $113 million for the impairment of an equity method investment in the U.S. based on a negotiated sales price and $4 million for inventory write-downs in the U.S. for obsolescence.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $262 million and $247 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $24 million and $6 million, respectively, was held by Altus. The Company had no restricted cash as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable are stated at amortized cost net of an allowance for credit losses. The Company routinely assesses the collectability of its financial assets measured at amortized cost. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses.\u201d The standard changes the impairment model for trade receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases, loans, and other financial assets measured at amortized cost. This ASU requires the use of a new forward-looking \u201cexpected loss\u201d model compared to the previous \u201cincurred loss\u201d model, resulting in accelerated recognition of credit losses. Apache adopted this update in the first quarter of 2020. This ASU primarily applies to the Company\u2019s accounts receivable balances, of which the majority are received within a short-term period of one year or less. The Company monitors the credit quality of its counterparties through review of collections, credit ratings, and other analyses. The Company develops its estimated allowance for credit losses primarily using an aging method and analyses of historical loss rates as well as consideration of current and future conditions that could impact its counterparties\u2019 credit quality and liquidity. The adoption and implementation of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nThe following table presents changes to the Company\u2019s allowance for credit loss:\nInventories\nInventories consist principally of tubular goods and equipment and are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value. Oil produced but not sold, primarily in the North Sea, is also recorded to inventory and is stated at the lower of the cost to produce or net realizable value.\nProperty and Equipment\nThe carrying value of the Company\u2019s property and equipment represents the cost incurred to acquire the property and equipment, including capitalized interest, net of any impairments. For business combinations, property and equipment cost is based on the fair values at the acquisition date.\nOil and Gas Property\nThe Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas property. Under this method of accounting, exploration costs such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals, and exploration overhead are expensed as incurred. All costs related to production, general corporate overhead, and similar activities are expensed as incurred. If an exploratory well provides evidence to justify potential development of reserves, drilling costs associated with the well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. This determination may take longer than one year in certain areas depending on, among other things, the amount of hydrocarbons discovered, the outcome of planned geological and engineering studies, the need for additional appraisal drilling activities to determine whether the discovery is sufficient to support an economic development plan, and government sanctioning of development activities in certain international locations. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory well costs in light of ongoing exploration activities; in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAcquisition costs of unproved properties are assessed for impairment at least annually and are transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment based on the Company\u2019s current exploration plans. Unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis over the average lease term at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged to exploration expense, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Costs of maintaining and retaining unproved properties, as well as amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases, are included in exploration costs in the statement of consolidated operations.\nCosts to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized. Depreciation of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production (UOP) method. The UOP calculation multiplies the percentage of estimated proved reserves produced each quarter by the carrying value of associated proved oil and gas properties. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. The reserve base used to calculate the depreciation for capitalized well costs is the sum of proved developed reserves only. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are included in the depreciable cost.\nOil and gas properties are grouped for depreciation in accordance with ASC 932 \u201cExtractive Activities-Oil and Gas.\u201d The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.\nWhen circumstances indicate that the carrying value of proved oil and gas properties may not be recoverable, the Company compares unamortized capitalized costs to the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows for the associated assets grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of cash flows of other assets. If the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows, based on Apache\u2019s estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally estimated using the income approach described in ASC 820. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments, a Level 3 fair value measurement.\nThe significant decline in crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as longer-term commodity price outlooks, related to reduced demand for oil and natural gas as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental actions indicated possible impairment of the Company\u2019s proved and unproved oil and gas properties in early 2020. In addition to estimating risk-adjusted reserves and future production volumes, estimated future commodity prices are the largest driver in variability of undiscounted pre-tax cash flows. Expected cash flows were estimated based on management\u2019s views of published West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent, and Henry Hub forward pricing as of the balance sheet dates. Other significant assumptions and inputs used to calculate estimated future cash flows include estimates for future development activity, exploration plans and remaining lease terms. A 10 percent discount rate, based on a market-based weighted-average cost of capital estimate, was applied to the undiscounted cash flow estimate to value all of the Company\u2019s asset groups that were subject to impairment charges in 2020. Similar assumptions were applied to impairments recorded in 2019 and 2018.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following table represents non-cash impairments charges of the carrying value of the Company\u2019s proved and unproved properties:\nProved properties impaired had aggregate fair values as of the most recent date of impairment of $1.9 billion and $628 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nUnproved leasehold impairments are typically recorded as a component of \u201cExploration\u201d expense in the Company\u2019s statement of consolidated operations. However, in 2019, unproved impairments of $149 million were recorded as a component of \u201cImpairments\u201d in connection with an agreement to sell certain non-core leasehold properties in Oklahoma and Texas. In addition, in 2018, unproved impairments of $10 million were recorded as a component of \u201cImpairments\u201d in connection with an agreement to sell certain unproved properties in the North Sea.\nGains and losses on divestitures of the Company\u2019s oil and gas properties are recognized in the statement of consolidated operations upon closing of the transaction. Refer to Note 2-Acquisitions and Divestitures for more detail.\nGathering, Processing, and Transmission Facilities\nGPT facilities totaled $670 million and $799 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with accumulated depreciation for these assets totaling $323 million and $310 million for the respective periods. GPT facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimation of useful life takes into consideration anticipated production lives from the fields serviced by the GPT assets, whether Apache-operated or third party-operated, as well as potential development plans by the Company for undeveloped acreage within or in close proximity to those fields.\nThe Company assesses the carrying amount of its GPT facilities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of these facilities is more than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over its fair value.\nApache assessed its long-lived infrastructure assets for impairment at March 31, 2020, and recorded an impairment of $68 million on its GPT facilities in Egypt during the first quarter of 2020. The fair values of the impaired assets, which were determined to be $46 million, were estimated using the income approach, which considers internal estimates based on future throughput volumes from applicable development concessions in Egypt and estimated costs to operate. These assumptions were applied based on throughput assumptions developed in relation to the oil and gas proved property impairment assessment as discussed above to develop future cash flow projections that were then discounted to estimated fair value, using a 10 percent discount rate, based on a market-based weighted-average cost of capital estimate. Apache has classified these non-recurring fair value measurements as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAs discussed under \u201cFair Value Measurements\u201d above, the Company decided to materially reduce its planned investment in the Alpine High play during its fourth-quarter 2019 capital planning review. Altus management subsequently assessed its long-lived infrastructure assets for impairment given the expected reduction to future throughput volumes and recorded impairments of $1.3 billion on its gathering, processing, and transmission assets. The fair values of the impaired assets were determined to be $203 million as of the time of the impairment and were estimated using the income approach. The income approach considered internal estimates of future throughput volumes, processing rates, and costs. These assumptions were applied to develop future cash flow projections that were then discounted to estimated fair value, using discount rates believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants. Apache has classified these non-recurring fair value measurements as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nDuring 2018, the Company recorded impairments of the entire net book value of certain GPT assets in the U.S. in the amount of $56 million associated with a proposed divestiture package.\nThe costs of GPT assets sold or otherwise disposed of and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from Apache\u2019s consolidated financial statements, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in \u201cGain on divestitures\u201d under \u201cRevenues and Other\u201d in the Company\u2019s statement of consolidated operations. A $2 million loss was recorded on the sale of power generators during 2020, and no gain or loss on the sales of GPT facilities was recognized during 2019 or 2018.\nOther Property and Equipment\nOther property and equipment includes computer software and equipment, buildings, vehicles, furniture and fixtures, land, and other equipment. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 20 years. Other property and equipment totaled $1.1 billion at each of December 31, 2020 and 2019, with accumulated depreciation for these assets totaling $864 million and $817 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAsset Retirement Costs and Obligations\nThe initial estimated asset retirement obligation related to property and equipment and subsequent revisions are recorded as a liability at fair value, with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the associated property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. Revisions in estimated liabilities can result from changes in estimated inflation rates, changes in service and equipment costs and changes in the estimated timing of an asset\u2019s retirement. Asset retirement costs are depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to that used for the associated property and equipment. Accretion expense on the liability is recognized over the estimated productive life of the related assets.\nCapitalized Interest\nFor significant projects, interest is capitalized as part of the historical cost of developing and constructing assets. Significant oil and gas investments in unproved properties actively being explored, significant exploration and development projects that have not commenced production, significant midstream development activities that are in progress, and investments in equity method affiliates that are undergoing the construction of assets that have not commenced principal operations qualify for interest capitalization. Interest is capitalized until the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest is determined by multiplying the Company\u2019s weighted-average borrowing cost on debt by the average amount of qualifying costs incurred. Once an asset subject to interest capitalization is completed and placed in service, the associated capitalized interest is expensed through depreciation.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and it is recorded in \u201cDeferred charges and other\u201d in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. The Company assesses the carrying amount of goodwill by testing for impairment annually and when impairment indicators arise. The impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to assigned reporting units. Apache assesses each country as a reporting unit, with Egypt being the only reporting unit to have associated goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the book value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value, including goodwill, then goodwill is written down to its implied fair value through a charge to expense.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nWhen there is a disposal of a reporting unit or a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business, goodwill associated with that business is included in the carrying amount to determine the gain or loss on disposal. The amount of goodwill allocated to the carrying amount of a business can significantly impact the amount of gain or loss recognized on the sale of that business. The amount of goodwill to be included in that carrying amount is based on the relative fair value of the business to be disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained.\nThe following presents the changes to goodwill for the years ended 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nReductions in estimated net present value of expected future cash flows from oil and gas properties resulted in implied fair values below the carrying values of the Company\u2019s Egypt reporting unit. As a result of these assessments, the Company recognized non-cash impairments of the entire amount of recorded goodwill in the Egypt reporting unit of $87 million. This goodwill impairment has been recorded in \u201cImpairments\u201d in the Company\u2019s statement of consolidated operations.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAccruals for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, environmental and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted as additional information becomes available or circumstances change. For more information regarding loss contingencies, refer to Note 11-Commitments and Contingencies.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe years ended 2019 and 2018 include the reclassification of $176 million and $357 million, respectively, from \u201cOther\u201d to \u201cPurchased oil and gas sales,\u201d both within \u201cRevenues and Other\u201d and the respective associated $142 million and $340 million purchased oil and gas costs from \u201cOther\u201d within \u201cRevenues and Other\u201d to \u201cPurchased oil and gas costs\u201d within \u201cOperating Expenses\u201d on the Company\u2019s consolidated statement of operations to conform to the current-year presentation.\nUpstream\nThe Company\u2019s upstream oil and gas segments primarily generate revenue from contracts with customers from the sale of its crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production volumes. In addition to Apache-related production volumes, the Company also sells commodity volumes purchased from third-parties to fulfill sales obligations and commitments as the Company\u2019s production fluctuates with potential operational issues and changes to development plans. Under these short-term commodity sales contracts, the physical delivery of each unit of quantity represents a single, distinct performance obligation on behalf of the Company. Contract prices are determined based on market-indexed prices, adjusted for quality, transportation, and other market-reflective differentials. Revenue is measured by allocating an entirely variable market price to each performance obligation and recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. The Company considers a variety of facts and circumstances in assessing the point of control transfer, including but not limited to: whether the purchaser can direct the use of the hydrocarbons, the transfer of significant risks and rewards, and the Company\u2019s right to payment. Control typically transfers to customers upon the physical delivery at specified locations within each contract and the transfer of title.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe Company\u2019s Egypt operations are conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts under which the contractor partners (Contractors) pay all operating and capital costs for exploring and developing defined concessions. A percentage of the production, generally up to 40 percent, is available to Contractors to recover these operating and capital costs over contractually defined periods. The balance of the production is split among the Contractors and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on a contractually defined basis. Additionally, the Contractors\u2019 income taxes, which remain the liability of the Contractors under domestic law, are paid by EGPC on behalf of the Contractors out of EGPC\u2019s production entitlement. Income taxes paid to the Arab Republic of Egypt on behalf of Apache as Contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax expense and reflected as production and estimated reserves. Revenues related to Egypt\u2019s tax volumes are considered revenue from a non-customer.\nRefer to Note 17-Business Segment Information for a disaggregation of revenue by product and reporting segment.\nAltus Midstream\nThe Company\u2019s Altus Midstream segment is operated by ALTM, through its subsidiary, Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus). Altus generates revenue from contracts with customers from its gathering, compression, processing, and transmission services provided on Apache\u2019s natural gas and natural gas liquid production volumes. Under these long-term commercial service contracts, providing the related service represents a single, distinct performance obligation on behalf of Altus that is satisfied over time. In accordance with the terms of these agreements, Altus receives a fixed fee for each contract year, subject to yearly fee escalation recalculations. Revenue is measured using the output method and recognized in the amount to which Altus has the right to invoice, as performance completed to date corresponds directly with the value to its customers. For the periods presented, Altus Midstream segment revenues were primarily attributable to sales between Altus and Apache, which are fully eliminated upon consolidation.\nPayment Terms and Contract Balances\nPayments under all contracts with customers are typically due and received within a short-term period of one year or less, after physical delivery of the product or service has been rendered. Receivables from contracts with customers, net of allowance for credit losses, totaled $670 million and $945 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn accordance with the provisions of ASC 606, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d variable market prices for each short-term commodity sale are allocated entirely to each performance obligation as the terms of payment relate specifically to the Company\u2019s efforts to satisfy its obligations. As such, the Company has elected the practical expedients available under the standard to not disclose the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, performance obligations as of the end of the reporting period.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nApache periodically enters into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price, interest rate, and/or foreign exchange risk. These derivative contracts, which are generally placed with major financial institutions, may take the form of forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, or options.\nAll derivative instruments, other than those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception, are recorded on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. The Company does not apply hedge accounting to any of its derivative instruments. As a result, gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments are reported in current-period income as \u201cDerivative instrument losses, net\u201d under \u201cRevenues and Other\u201d in the statement of consolidated operations. Refer to Note 4-Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for further information.\nIncome Taxes\nApache records deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements and tax returns. The Company routinely assesses the ability to realize its deferred tax assets. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices) and changing tax laws.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company\u2019s basic earnings per share (EPS) amounts have been computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects potential dilution, using the treasury stock method, which assumes that options were exercised and restricted stock was fully vested. The Company uses the \u201cif-converted method\u201d to determine the potential dilutive effect of an assumed exchange of the outstanding Preferred Units of Altus Midstream for shares of Altus\u2019 common stock. The impact to net income (loss) attributable to common stock on an assumed conversion of the redeemable noncontrolling Preferred Units interest in Altus Midstream LP were anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nStock-Based Compensation\nApache grants various types of stock-based awards including stock options, restricted stock, cash-settled restricted stock units, and performance-based awards. Stock compensation equity awards granted are valued on the date of grant and are expensed over the required vesting service period. Cash-settled awards are recorded as a liability based on the Company\u2019s stock price and remeasured at the end of each reporting period over the vesting terms. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than estimate expected forfeitures. The Company\u2019s stock-based compensation plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in Note 14-Capital Stock.\nTreasury Stock\nThe Company follows the weighted-average-cost method of accounting for treasury stock transactions.\nTransaction, Reorganization, and Separation (TRS)\nIn recent years, the Company streamlined its portfolio through strategic divestitures and centralized certain operational activities in an effort to capture greater efficiencies and cost savings through shared services. In light of the continued streamlining of the Company\u2019s asset portfolio through divestitures and strategic transactions, in late 2019 management initiated a comprehensive redesign of Apache\u2019s organizational structure and operations. Reorganization efforts were substantially completed during 2020. Apache has incurred a cumulative total of $79 million of reorganization costs through December 31, 2020, all of which were paid in 2020.\nThe Company recorded $54 million, $50 million, and $28 million of TRS costs in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. TRS costs incurred in 2020 relate to $51 million of separation costs associated with the reorganization, $2 million for transaction consulting fees, and $1 million of office closure costs. TRS costs incurred in 2019 associated with the reorganization include $26 million and $2 million for employee termination benefits and consulting fees related to the reorganization, respectively. The Company also incurred $15 million of expenses for employee termination benefits and office closures associated with other reorganization efforts and $7 million for consulting and legal fees on various transactions throughout 2019. Charges for 2018 include $22 million for consulting and legal fees related to divestitures and the Altus transaction, and $6 million related to employee separations.\nNew Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-10, \u201cCodification Improvements,\u201d which clarifies or improves disclosure requirements for various topics to align with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. This update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2021 and will be applied retrospectively. The adoption and implementation of this ASU will not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, \u201cDebt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)\u201d to improve financial reporting associated with the accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity\u2019s own equity. This update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2022, with early adoption permitted, using either the modified or fully retrospective method with a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Company is evaluating the effect of adoption of the ASU and does not believe it will have a material impact on its financial statements.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, \u201cReference Rate Reform (Topic 848),\u201d which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, which clarified the scope and application of the original guidance. The guidance was effective beginning March 12, 2020 and can be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. The Company is evaluating whether to apply any of these expedients and, if elected, will adopt these standards when LIBOR is discontinued.\n2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\n2020 Activity\nDuring 2020, the Company completed leasehold and property acquisitions, primarily in the Permian Basin, for total cash consideration of $4 million. Also during 2020, the Company completed the sale of certain non-core assets and leasehold, primarily in the Permian Basin, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of $87 million, and recognized a gain of $13 million.\n2019 Activity\nU.S. Divestitures\nIn the third quarter of 2019, Apache completed the sale of non-core assets in the western Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma and Texas for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $322 million and the assumption of asset retirement obligations of $49 million. These assets met the criteria to be classified as held for sale in the second quarter of 2019. Accordingly, the Company performed a fair value assessment of the assets and recorded impairments of $240 million to the carrying value of proved and unproved oil and gas properties, other fixed assets, and working capital. The transaction closed in the third quarter of 2019, and the Company recognized a $7 million loss in connection with the sale.\nIn the second quarter of 2019, Apache completed the sale of certain non-core assets in Oklahoma that had a net carrying value of $206 million for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $223 million. The Company recognized a $17 million gain in connection with the sale.\nDuring 2019, the Company also completed the sale of certain other non-core producing assets, GPT assets, and leasehold acreage, primarily in the Permian Basin, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of $73 million. The Company recognized a net gain of approximately $33 million upon closing of these transactions.\nSuriname Joint Venture Agreement\nIn December 2019, Apache entered into a joint venture agreement with Total S.A. to explore and develop Block 58 offshore Suriname. Under the terms of the agreement, Apache and Total S.A. each hold a 50 percent working interest in Block 58. Pursuant to the agreement, Apache operated the drilling of the first four wells, the Maka Central-1, Sapakara West-1, Kwaskwasi-1, and Keskesi East-1, and subsequently transferred operatorship of Block 58 to Total S.A. on January 1, 2021. Apache will continue to operate the Keskesi exploration well until completion of drilling operations.\nIn connection with the agreement, Apache received $100 million from Total S.A. upon closing in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $79 million upon satisfying certain closing conditions in the first quarter of 2020 for reimbursement of 50 percent of all costs incurred on Block 58 as of December 31, 2019. All proceeds were applied against the carrying value of the Company\u2019s Suriname properties and associated inventory. The Company recognized a $19 million gain in the first quarter of 2020 associated with the transaction.\nApache will also receive various other forms of consideration, including $5.0 billion of cash carry on Apache\u2019s first $7.5 billion of appraisal and development capital, 25 percent cash carry on all of Apache\u2019s appraisal and development capital beyond the first $7.5 billion, a $75 million cash payment upon achieving first oil production, and future contingent royalty payments from successful joint development projects.\nLeasehold, Property, and Other Acquisitions\nDuring 2019, the Company completed leasehold and property acquisitions, primarily in the Permian Basin, for total cash consideration of $40 million.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAs part of the Altus transaction described below, Apache contributed options (Pipeline Options) to acquire equity interests in five separate third-party pipeline projects (the Equity Method Interest Pipelines) to Altus Midstream and/or its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2019, four of the five Pipeline Options had been exercised to acquire various ownership interests in the associated Equity Method Interest Pipelines. The fifth Pipeline Option to acquire an equity interest in a separate intra-basin NGL pipeline was not exercised and expired on March 2, 2020. For discussion of the Equity Method Interest Pipelines, refer to Note 6-Equity Method Interests.\n2018 Activity\nAltus Transaction\nIn November 2018, Apache completed a transaction with Altus Midstream Company to create a pure-play, Permian Basin midstream C-corporation anchored by the Company\u2019s GPT assets at Alpine High. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company contributed certain Alpine High midstream assets and the Pipeline Options to Altus and/or its subsidiaries. Altus Midstream Company contributed approximately $628 million of cash, net of transaction expenses. The transaction was accounted for by Altus as a reverse recapitalization. Under this method of accounting, Altus Midstream Company was treated as the \u201cacquired\u201d company, and Apache\u2019s contributed assets of approximately $1.1 billion remained at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Apache owns an approximate 79 percent ownership interest in Altus.\nApache fully consolidates the assets and liabilities of Altus in its consolidated financial statements, with a corresponding noncontrolling interest reflected separately. Apache recorded a noncontrolling interest of $406 million upon closing, which is reflected as a separate component of equity in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. This represents approximately 21 percent third party ownership of the net assets in Altus at the time of the transaction. The cash contributions in excess of the noncontrolling interest were recognized as additional paid-in capital.\nOther Activity\nDuring 2018, the Company completed the sale of certain non-core assets and leasehold, primarily in the North Sea and Permian Basin, in multiple transactions for total cash proceeds of $138 million. The Company recognized gains of approximately $23 million during 2018 upon the closing of these transactions.\nDuring 2018, the Company completed leasehold and property acquisitions, primarily in the Permian Basin, for cash proceeds of $133 million.\n3. CAPITALIZED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS\nThe following summarizes the changes in capitalized exploratory well costs for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. Additions pending the determination of proved reserves excludes amounts capitalized and subsequently charged to expense within the same year.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following provides an aging of capitalized exploratory well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling as of December 31:\nSuspended exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling at December 31, 2020, relate to onshore projects in Egypt. Drilling activity and testing has continued for these projects throughout 2020, and these projects are currently being evaluated for potential development.\nSuspended exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling at December 31, 2019, relate to separate onshore projects in the United States and Egypt. The costs related to the U.S. projects were charged to exploration expense in the current year based on management\u2019s assessment and development efforts through year end.\nSuspended exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling at December 31, 2018, included $28 million related to exploratory drilling in Suriname. In December 2019, Apache entered into the joint venture agreement with Total S.A., pursuant to which Apache sold 50 percent of its ownership interest in Block 58 to Total S.A. Proceeds received from Total S.A. upon closing were applied against the carrying value of its Suriname properties.\nThe following table summarizes aging by geographic area of those exploratory well costs that, as of December 31, 2020, have been capitalized for a period greater than one year, categorized by the year in which drilling was completed:\n4. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nObjectives and Strategies\nApache is exposed to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on the majority of its worldwide production, as well as transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The Company manages the variability in its cash flows by occasionally entering into derivative transactions on a portion of its crude oil and natural gas production and foreign currency transactions. The Company utilizes various types of derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, and options, to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices or foreign currency values.\nCounterparty Risk\nThe use of derivative instruments exposes the Company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty. To reduce the concentration of exposure to any individual counterparty, Apache utilizes a diversified group of investment-grade rated counterparties, primarily financial institutions, for its derivative transactions. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had derivative positions with six counterparties. The Company monitors counterparty creditworthiness on an ongoing basis; however, it cannot predict sudden changes in counterparties\u2019 creditworthiness. In addition, even if such changes are not sudden, the Company may be limited in its ability to mitigate an increase in counterparty credit risk. Should one of these counterparties not perform, Apache may not realize the benefit of some of its derivative instruments resulting from changes in commodity prices, currency exchange rates, or interest rates.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDerivative Instruments\nCommodity Derivative Instruments\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had the following open natural gas financial basis swap contracts:\nEmbedded Derivatives\nAltus Preferred Units Embedded Derivative\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, Altus Midstream LP issued and sold Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. Certain redemption features embedded within the Preferred Units require bifurcation and measurement at fair value. For further discussion of this derivative, see \u201cFair Value Measurements\u201d below and Note 13-Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest - Altus.\nPipeline Capacity Embedded Derivatives\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020, Apache entered into separate agreements to assign a portion of its contracted capacity under an existing transportation agreement to third parties. Embedded in these agreements are arrangements under which Apache has the potential to receive payments calculated based on pricing differentials between Houston Ship Channel and Waha during calendar years 2020 and 2021. These features require bifurcation and measurement of the change in market values for each period. Unrealized gains or losses in the fair value of these features are recorded as \u201cDerivative instrument losses, net\u201d under \u201cRevenues and Other\u201d in the statement of consolidated operations. Any proceeds received will be deferred and reflected in income over the original tenure of the transportation agreement.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe following table presents the Company\u2019s derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\n(1)The derivative fair values are based on analysis of each contract on a gross basis, excluding the impact of netting agreements with counterparties.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe fair values of the Company\u2019s derivative instruments and pipeline capacity embedded derivatives are not actively quoted in the open market. The Company primarily uses a market approach to estimate the fair values of these derivatives on a recurring basis, utilizing futures pricing for the underlying positions provided by a reputable third party, a Level 2 fair value measurement.\nThe fair value of the Preferred Units embedded derivative is calculated using an income approach, a Level 3 fair value measurement. The fair value determination is based on a range of factors, including expected future interest rates using the Black-Karasinski model, Altus\u2019 imputed interest rate, interest rate volatility, the expected timing of periodic cash distributions, the estimated timing for the potential exercise of the exchange option, and anticipated dividend yields of the Preferred Units. As of the December 31, 2020 valuation date, the Company used the forward B-rated Energy Bond Yield curve to develop the following key unobservable inputs used to value this embedded derivative:\nA one percent increase in the imputed interest rate assumption would significantly increase the value of the embedded derivative as of December 31, 2020, while a one percent decrease would lead to a similar decrease in value as of December 31, 2020. The assumed expected timing until exercise of the exchange option at December 31, 2020 was 5.45 years.\nDerivative Activity Recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nAll derivative instruments are reflected as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet. These fair values are recorded by netting asset and liability positions where counterparty master netting arrangements contain provisions for net settlement. The carrying value of the Company\u2019s derivative assets and liabilities and their locations on the consolidated balance sheet are as follows:\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDerivative Activity Recorded in the Statement of Consolidated Operations\nThe following table summarizes the effect of derivative instruments on the Company\u2019s statement of consolidated operations:\nDerivative instrument gains and losses are recorded in \u201cDerivative instrument losses, net\u201d under \u201cRevenues and Other\u201d in the Company\u2019s statement of consolidated operations. Unrealized gains (losses) for derivative activity recorded in the statement of consolidated operations are reflected in the statement of consolidated cash flows separately as \u201cUnrealized derivative instrument losses (gains), net\u201d in \u201cAdjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operating activities.\u201d\n5. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\nThe following table provides detail of the Company\u2019s other current assets as of December 31:\n6. EQUITY METHOD INTERESTS\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Apache, through its ownership of Altus, has the following equity method interests in four Permian Basin long-haul pipeline entities, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For each of the equity method interests, Altus has the ability to exercise significant influence based on certain governance provisions and its participation in activities and decisions that impact the management and economic performance of the equity method interests.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, unamortized basis differences included in the equity method interest balances were $38 million and $30 million, respectively. These amounts represent differences in Altus\u2019 initial costs paid to acquire the equity method interests and its initial underlying equity in the respective entities, as well as capitalized interest related to Permian Highway Pipeline (PHP) construction costs. Unamortized basis differences are amortized into equity income (loss) over the useful lives of the underlying pipeline assets when they are placed into service.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following table presents the activity in Altus\u2019 equity method interests for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n(1)Altus\u2019 proportionate share of the PHP construction costs is funded with Altus\u2019 revolving credit facility. Accordingly, Altus capitalized $8 million and $2 million of related interest expense during 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are included in the basis of the PHP equity interest.\nSummarized Combined Financial Information\nThe following presents summarized information of combined statement of operations for Altus\u2019 equity method interests (on a 100 percent basis):\n(1)Although Altus\u2019 interests in EPIC Crude Holdings, LP, Permian Highway Pipeline LLC, and Breviloba, LLC were acquired in March, May, and July 2019, respectively, the combined financial results are presented for the year ended December 31, 2019 for comparability.\n(2)Although Altus\u2019 interest in Gulf Coast Express Pipeline LLC was acquired in December 2018, the combined financial results are presented for the year ended December 31, 2018 for comparability.\nThe following presents summarized combined balance sheet information for Altus\u2019 equity method interests (on a 100 percent basis) as of December 31:\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n7. OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES\nThe following table provides detail of the Company\u2019s other current liabilities as of December 31:\n8. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION\nThe following table describes changes to the Company\u2019s asset retirement obligation (ARO) liability:\nThe ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with Apache\u2019s oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. The Company estimates the ultimate productive life of the properties, a risk-adjusted discount rate, and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property or other long-lived asset balance.\nDuring 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $10 million and $41 million, respectively, in abandonment liabilities resulting from Apache\u2019s exploration and development capital program. Liabilities settled primarily relate to individual properties, platforms, and facilities plugged and abandoned during the period. During 2020, approximately $23 million net abandonment costs were revised upward to reflect changes in estimates of timing and costs, primarily in the North Sea. During 2019, approximately $110 million net abandonment costs were revised downward to reflect changes in estimates of timing and costs, primarily in the North Sea.\n9. DEBT AND FINANCING COSTS\nOverview\nAll of the Company\u2019s debt is senior unsecured debt and has equal priority with respect to the payment of both principal and interest. All indentures for the notes and debentures described below place certain restrictions on the Company, including limits on Apache\u2019s ability to incur debt secured by certain liens. Certain of these indentures also restrict the Company\u2019s ability to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and give holders the option to require the Company to repurchase outstanding notes and debentures upon certain changes in control. None of the indentures contain prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nIn August 2018, Apache closed an offering of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured 4.375% notes due October 15, 2028. The notes are redeemable at any time, in whole or in part, at Apache\u2019s option, subject to a make-whole premium. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to purchase certain outstanding notes in cash tender offers, repay notes that matured in September 2018, and for general corporate purposes.\nAlso in August 2018, Apache closed cash tender offers for certain outstanding notes. Apache accepted for purchase $731 million aggregate principal amount of certain notes covered by the tender offers. Apache paid holders an aggregate of approximately $828 million reflecting principal, the discount to par, early tender premium, and accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a net loss of $94 million on extinguishment of debt, including $5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and discount, in connection with the note purchases.\nOn June 19, 2019, Apache closed offerings of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, comprised of $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.250% notes due January 15, 2030 and $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.350% notes due July 1, 2049. The notes are redeemable at any time, in whole or in part, at Apache\u2019s option, subject to a make-whole premium. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to purchase certain outstanding notes in cash tender offers and for general corporate purposes.\nOn June 21, 2019, the Company closed cash tender offers for certain outstanding notes. Apache accepted for purchase $932 million aggregate principal amount of certain notes covered by the tender offers. Apache paid holders an aggregate of approximately $1.0 billion reflecting principal, the net premium to par, early tender premium, and accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a net loss of $75 million on extinguishment of debt, including $7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and discount, in connection with the note purchases.\nOn August 17, 2020, the Company closed offerings of $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, comprised of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% notes due 2025 and $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% notes due 2027. The senior unsecured notes are redeemable at any time, in whole or in part, at Apache\u2019s option, at the applicable redemption price. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to purchase certain outstanding notes in cash tender offers, repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under the Company\u2019s senior revolving credit facility, and for general corporate purposes.\nOn August 18, 2020, the Company closed cash tender offers for certain outstanding notes. Apache accepted for purchase $644 million aggregate principal amount of certain notes covered by the tender offers. Apache paid holders an aggregate $644 million, reflecting principal, aggregate discount to par of $38 million, early tender premium of $32 million, and accrued and unpaid interest of $6 million. The Company recorded a net gain of $2 million on extinguishment of debt, including an acceleration of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, in connection with the note purchases.\nDuring 2020, the Company purchased in the open market and canceled senior notes issued under its indentures in an aggregate principal amount of $588 million for an aggregate purchase price of $428 million in cash, including accrued interest and broker fees, reflecting a discount to par of an aggregate $168 million. These repurchases resulted in a $158 million net gain on extinguishment of debt. The net gain includes an acceleration of related discount and debt issuance costs. The repurchases were financed by borrowings under the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility.\nThe Company records gains and losses on extinguishment of debt in \u201cFinancing costs, net\u201d in the Company\u2019s statement of consolidated operations.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following table presents the carrying value of the Company\u2019s debt:\n(1)On November 3, 2020, Apache redeemed the 3.625% senior notes due February 1, 2021, at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.\n(2)These notes are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Apache\u2019s option, subject to a make-whole premium, except that the 7.75% notes due 2029 are only redeemable as whole for principal and accrued interest in the event of certain Canadian tax law changes. The remaining notes and debentures are not redeemable.\n(3)Assumed by Apache in August 2017 as permitted by terms of these notes originally issued by a subsidiary and guaranteed by Apache.\n(4)The fair values of the Company\u2019s notes and debentures were $8.5 billion and $8.4 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Apache uses a market approach to determine the fair value of its notes and debentures using estimates provided by an independent investment financial data services firm (a Level 2 fair value measurement).\n(5)The carrying amount of borrowings on credit facilities approximates fair value because the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates.\nMaturities for the Company\u2019s notes and debentures excluding discount and debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nUncommitted Lines of Credit\nThe Company from time to time has and uses uncommitted credit and letter of credit facilities for working capital and credit support purposes. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities. As of December 31, 2020, there were \u00a334 million and $17 million in letters of credit outstanding under these facilities. As of December 31, 2019, there were \u00a322 million and $3 million in letters of credit outstanding under these facilities.\nUnsecured Committed Bank Credit Facilities\nIn March 2018, Apache entered into a revolving credit facility with commitments totaling $4.0 billion. In March 2019, the term of this facility was extended by one year to March 2024 (subject to Apache\u2019s remaining one-year extension option) pursuant to Apache\u2019s exercise of an extension option. The Company can increase commitments up to $5.0 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. The facility includes a letter of credit subfacility of up to $3.0 billion, of which $2.08 billion was committed as of December 31, 2020. The facility is for general corporate purposes and available committed borrowing capacity supports Apache\u2019s commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2020, there were $150 million of borrowings and an aggregate of \u00a3633 million and $40 million in letters of credit outstanding under this facility. As of December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under this facility. The \u00a3633 million in outstanding letters of credit were issued to support North Sea decommissioning obligations, the terms of which required such support after Standard & Poor\u2019s reduced the Company\u2019s credit rating from BBB to BB+ on March 26, 2020.\nAt Apache\u2019s option, the interest rate per annum for borrowings under the 2018 facility is either a base rate, as defined, plus a margin, or the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin. The Company also pays quarterly a facility fee at a per annum rate on total commitments. The margins and the facility fee vary based upon the Company\u2019s senior long-term debt rating. At December 31, 2020, the base rate margin was 0.5 percent, the LIBOR margin was 1.50 percent, and the facility fee was 0.25 percent. A commission is payable quarterly to lenders on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit at a per annum rate equal to the LIBOR margin then in effect. Customary letter of credit fronting fees and other charges are payable to issuing banks.\nThe financial covenants of the 2018 credit facility require the Company to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. For purposes of this calculation, capital excludes the effects of non-cash write-downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after June 30, 2015.\nThe 2018 facility\u2019s negative covenants restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on its hydrocarbon-related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry; liens securing debt incurred to finance the acquisition, construction, improvement, or capital lease of assets, provided that such debt, when incurred, does not exceed the subject purchase price and costs, as applicable, and related expenses; liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the United States and Canada; and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics\u2019 liens. Apache also may incur liens on assets if debt secured thereby does not exceed 15 percent of Apache\u2019s consolidated net tangible assets, or approximately $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2020. Negative covenants also restrict Apache\u2019s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, dispose of substantially all of its assets, and guarantee debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.\nIn November 2018, Altus Midstream LP entered into a revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes that matures in November 2023 (subject to Altus Midstream LP\u2019s two, one-year extension options). The agreement for this facility, as amended, provides aggregate commitments from a syndicate of banks of $800 million. All aggregate commitments include a letter of credit subfacility of up to $100 million and a swingline loan subfacility of up to $100 million. Altus Midstream LP may increase commitments up to an aggregate $1.5 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were $624 million and $396 million, respectively, of borrowings, and no letters of credit outstanding under this facility.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe agreement for Altus Midstream LP\u2019s credit facility, as amended, restricts distributions in respect of capital to Apache and other unit holders in certain circumstances. Unless the Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 4.00:1.00, the agreement limits such distributions to $30 million per calendar year until either (i) the consolidated net income of Altus Midstream LP and its restricted subsidiaries, as adjusted pursuant to the agreement, for three consecutive calendar months equals or exceeds $350 million on an annualized basis or (ii) Altus Midstream LP has a specified senior long-term debt rating; in addition, before the occurrence of one of those two events, the Leverage Ratio must be less than or equal to 5.00:1.00. In no event can any distribution be made that would, after giving effect to it on a pro forma basis, result in a Leverage Ratio greater than (i) 5.00:1.00 or (ii) for a specified period after a qualifying acquisition, 5.50:1.00. The Leverage Ratio is the ratio of (1) the consolidated indebtedness of Altus Midstream LP and its restricted subsidiaries to (2) EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) of Altus Midstream LP and its restricted subsidiaries for the 12-month period ending immediately before the determination date. The Leverage Ratio as of December 31, 2020 was less than 4.00:1.00.\nThe terms of Altus Midstream LP\u2019s Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units also contain certain restrictions on distributions in respect of capital, including the common units held by Apache and any other units that rank junior to the Preferred Units with respect to distributions or distributions upon liquidation. Refer to Note 13-Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest - Altus for further information. In addition, the amount of any cash distributions to Altus Midstream LP by any entity in which it has an interest accounted for by the equity method is subject to such entity\u2019s compliance with the terms of any debt or other agreements by which it may be bound, which in turn may impact the amount of funds available for distribution by Altus Midstream LP to its partners.\nThe Altus Midstream LP credit facility is unsecured and is not guaranteed by Apache or any of Apache\u2019s other subsidiaries.\nThere are no clauses in either the agreement for Apache\u2019s 2018 credit facility or for Altus Midstream LP\u2019s 2018 credit facility that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. These agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. However, each agreement allows the lenders to accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches, and if a borrower or any of its subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, is insolvent, or has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold. Lenders may also accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments under the applicable agreement if Apache or Altus Midstream LP, as applicable, undergoes a specified change in control or any borrower has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold. Each of Apache and Altus Midstream LP was in compliance with the terms of its 2018 credit facility as of December 31, 2020.\nCommercial Paper Program\nApache\u2019s $3.5 billion commercial paper program, which is subject to market availability, facilitates Apache borrowing funds for up to 270 days. As a result of downgrades in the Company\u2019s credit ratings during 2020, the Company does not expect that its commercial paper program will be cost competitive with its other financing alternatives and does not anticipate using it under such circumstances. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding.\nFinancing Costs, Net\nThe following table presents the components of Apache\u2019s financing costs, net:\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $57 million of debt issuance costs, which will be charged to interest expense over the life of the related debt issuances. Discount amortization of $7 million, $2 million, and $3 million was recorded as interest expense in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n10. INCOME TAXES\nIncome (loss) before income taxes is composed of the following:\nThe total income tax provision consists of the following:\nThe total income tax provision differs from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. statutory income tax rate to income (loss) before income taxes. A reconciliation of the tax on the Company\u2019s income (loss) before income taxes and total tax expense is shown below:\n(1)The change in state valuation allowance is included as a component of state income tax.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe net deferred income tax liability reflects the net tax impact of temporary differences between the asset and liability amounts carried on the balance sheet under GAAP and amounts utilized for income tax purposes. The net deferred income tax liability consists of the following as of December 31:\nNet deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 as follows:\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) which provides guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, for the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA). SAB 118 provides a measurement period which should not extend beyond 1 year of the enactment date of the TCJA. In 2018, the Company recorded an additional $103 million deferred tax expense attributable to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. This deferred tax expense combined with the provisional amount recorded in 2017 were fully offset by available foreign tax credits. The Company completed its analysis of the income tax effects of the TCJA in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe Company has recorded an increase in valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, primarily driven by asset impairments. The Company has assessed the future potential to realize these deferred tax assets and has concluded that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized based on current economic conditions and expectations for the future.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nIn 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company\u2019s valuation allowance increased by $1.0 billion, $1.0 billion, and $131 million, respectively, as detailed in the table below:\n(1)Reported as a component of state income taxes.\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company had net operating losses as follows:\nThe Company has a U.S. net operating loss carryforward of $8.9 billion, which includes $186 million of net operating loss subject to annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Net operating losses generated in tax years beginning after 2017 are subject to an 80 percent taxable income limitation with indefinite carryover under the TCJA. The Company also has a net interest expense carryover of $1.1 billion under Section 163(j) of the Code subject to indefinite carryover, a U.S. capital loss carryforward of $1.8 billion, which has a five year carryover period expiring in 2023 and a Canadian capital loss carryforward of $836 million which has an indefinite carryover. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the U.S. net operating losses, the state net operating losses, the net interest expense carryover, the U.S. capital loss, and the Canadian capital loss carryforward because it is more likely than not that these attributes will not be realized.\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company had foreign tax credits as follows:\nThe Company has a $2.2 billion U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the U.S. foreign tax credits listed above because it is more likely than not that these attributes will expire unutilized.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, \u201cIncome Taxes,\u201d which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Tax positions generally refer to a position taken in a previously filed income tax return or expected to be included in a tax return to be filed in the future that is reflected in the measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nThe Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Each quarter, the Company assesses the amounts provided for and, as a result, may increase or reduce the amount of interest and penalties. During each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company recorded tax expense of $1 million for interest and penalties. At December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company had an accrued liability for interest and penalties of $3 million, $2 million, and $1 million, respectively.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nIn 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company recorded an $11 million net increase, $58 million net increase, and a $2 million net reduction, respectively, in its reserve for uncertain tax positions. The Company is currently under IRS audit for the 2014 through 2017 tax years.\nApache and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company\u2019s uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that may be subject to examination by the relevant taxing authority. Apache\u2019s earliest open tax years in its key jurisdictions are as follows:\nJurisdiction\nIn 2020, the Company early adopted ASU 2019-12, \u201cSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.\u201d The Company\u2019s early adoption of ASU 2019-12 using the prospective transition approach did not result in a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal Matters\nThe Company is party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, including litigation and governmental and regulatory controls. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has an accrued liability of approximately $70 million for all legal contingencies that are deemed to be probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated. The Company\u2019s estimates are based on information known about the matters and its experience in contesting, litigating, and settling similar matters. Although actual amounts could differ from management\u2019s estimate, none of the actions are believed by management to involve future amounts that would be material to the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity after consideration of recorded accruals. For material matters that the Company believes an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, the Company has disclosed the nature of the matter and a range of potential exposure, unless an estimate cannot be made at this time. It is management\u2019s opinion that the loss for any other litigation matters and claims that are reasonably possible to occur will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\nArgentine Environmental Claims\nOn March 12, 2014, the Company and its subsidiaries completed the sale of all of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 operations and properties in Argentina to YPF Sociedad Anonima (YPF). As part of that sale, YPF assumed responsibility for all of the past, present, and future litigation in Argentina involving Company subsidiaries, except that Company subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify YPF for certain environmental, tax, and royalty obligations capped at an aggregate of $100 million. The indemnity is subject to specific agreed conditions precedent, thresholds, contingencies, limitations, claim deadlines, loss sharing, and other terms and conditions. On April 11, 2014, YPF provided its first notice of claims pursuant to the indemnity. Company subsidiaries have not paid any amounts under the indemnity but will continue to review and consider claims presented by YPF. Further, Company subsidiaries retain the right to enforce certain Argentina-related indemnification obligations against Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer) in an amount up to $45 million pursuant to the terms and conditions of stock purchase agreements entered in 2006 between Company subsidiaries and subsidiaries of Pioneer.\nLouisiana Restoration\nLouisiana surface owners often file lawsuits or assert claims against oil and gas companies, including the Company, claiming that operators and working interest owners in the chain of title are liable for environmental damages on the leased premises, including damages measured by the cost of restoration of the leased premises to its original condition, regardless of the value of the underlying property. From time to time, restoration lawsuits and claims are resolved by the Company for amounts that are not material to the Company, while new lawsuits and claims are asserted against the Company. With respect to each of the pending lawsuits and claims, the amount claimed is not currently determinable or is not material. Further, the overall exposure related to these lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable. While adverse judgments against the Company are possible, the Company intends to actively defend these lawsuits and claims.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nStarting in November of 2013 and continuing into 2020, several parishes in Louisiana have pending lawsuits against many oil and gas producers, including the Company. These cases were all removed to federal courts in Louisiana. Some of the cases have been remanded to state court with the remand orders being appealed. In these cases, the Parishes, as plaintiffs, allege that defendants\u2019 oil and gas exploration, production, and transportation operations in specified fields were conducted in violation of the State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, as amended, and applicable regulations, rules, orders, and ordinances promulgated or adopted thereunder by the Parish or the State of Louisiana. Plaintiffs allege that defendants caused substantial damage to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of Louisiana. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, unspecified damages for alleged violations of applicable law within the coastal zone, the payment of costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate, detoxify, and otherwise restore the subject coastal zone as near as practicable to its original condition, and actual restoration of the coastal zone to its original condition. While adverse judgments against the Company might be possible, the Company intends to vigorously oppose these claims.\nApollo Exploration Lawsuit\nIn a case captioned Apollo Exploration, LLC, Cogent Exploration, Ltd. Co. & SellmoCo, LLC v. Apache Corporation, Cause No. CV50538 in the 385th Judicial District Court, Midland County, Texas, plaintiffs alleged damages in excess of $200 million (having previously claimed in excess of $1.1 billion) relating to purchase and sale agreements, mineral leases, and areas of mutual interest agreements concerning properties located in Hartley, Moore, Potter, and Oldham Counties, Texas. The Court entered final judgment in favor of the Company, ruling that the plaintiffs take nothing by their claims and awarding the Company its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in defending the lawsuit. The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is pending.\nAustralian Operations Divestiture Dispute\nPursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated April 9, 2015 (Quadrant SPA), the Company and its subsidiaries divested their remaining Australian operations to Quadrant Energy Pty Ltd (Quadrant). Closing occurred on June 5, 2015. In April 2017, the Company filed suit against Quadrant for breach of the Quadrant SPA. In its suit, the Company seeks approximately AUD $80 million. In December 2017, Quadrant filed a defense of equitable set-off to the Company\u2019s claim and a counterclaim seeking approximately AUD $200 million in the aggregate. The Company believes that Quadrant\u2019s claims lack merit and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operation, or liquidity.\nCanadian Operations Divestiture Dispute\nPursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated July 6, 2017 (Paramount SPA), the Company and its subsidiaries divested their remaining Canadian operations to Paramount Resources LTD (Paramount). Closing occurred on August 16, 2017. On September 11, 2019, four ex-employees of Apache Canada on behalf of themselves and individuals employed by Apache Canada LTD on July 6, 2017, filed an Amended Statement of Claim in a matter styled Stephen Flesch et. al. v Apache Corporation et. al., No. 1901-09160 Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Alberta against the Company and others seeking class certification and a finding that the Paramount SPA amounted to a Change of Control of the Company, entitling them to accelerated vesting under the Company\u2019s equity plans. In the suit, the purported class seeks approximately $60 million USD and punitive damages. The Company believes that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims lack merit and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operation, or liquidity.\nCalifornia and Delaware Litigation\nOn July 17, 2017, in three separate actions, San Mateo County, California, Marin County, California, and the City of Imperial Beach, California, all filed suit individually and on behalf of the people of the state of California against over 30 oil and gas companies alleging damages as a result of global warming. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. On December 20, 2017, in two separate actions, the City of Santa Cruz and Santa Cruz County and in a separate action on January 22, 2018, the City of Richmond, filed similar lawsuits against many of the same defendants. On November 14, 2018, the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Associations, Inc. also filed a similar lawsuit against many of the same defendants. After removal of all such lawsuits to federal court, the district court remanded them back to state court. The remand decision, and further activity in the cases, has been stayed pending further appellate review.\nOn September 10, 2020, the State of Delaware filed suit, individually and on behalf of the people of the State of Delaware, against over 25 oil and gas companies alleging damages as a result of global warming. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe Company believes that it is not subject to jurisdiction of the California courts and that claims made against it in the Delaware litigation are baseless. The Company intends to challenge jurisdiction in California and to vigorously defend the Delaware lawsuit.\nCastex Lawsuit\nIn a case styled Apache Corporation v. Castex Offshore, Inc., et. al., Cause No. 2015-48580, in the 113th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, Castex filed claims for alleged damages of approximately $200 million, relating to overspend on the Belle Isle Gas Facility upgrade, and the drilling of five sidetracks on the Potomac #3 well. After a jury trial, a verdict of approximately $60 million, plus fees, costs and interest was entered against the Company. The Company\u2019s appeal is pending.\nOklahoma Class Actions\nThe Company is a party to two purported class actions in Oklahoma styled Bigie Lee Rhea v. Apache Corporation, Case No. 6:14-cv-00433-JH, and Albert Steven Allen v. Apache Corporation, Case No. CJ-2019-00219. The Rhea case has been certified and includes a class of royalty owners seeking damages in excess of $250 million for alleged breach of the implied covenant to market relating to post-production deductions and alleged NGL uplift value. The Allen case has not been certified and seeks to represent a group of owners who have allegedly received late royalty and other payments under Oklahoma statutes. The amount of this claim is not yet reasonably determinable. While adverse judgments against the Company are possible, the Company intends to vigorously defend these lawsuits and claims.\nStockholder Lawsuits\nOn February 23, 2021, a case captioned Plymouth County Retirement System v. Apache Corporation, et al. was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division) against the Company and certain current and former officers. The complaint, which is a shareholder lawsuit styled as a class action (1) alleges that the Company intentionally used unrealistic assumptions regarding the amount and composition of available oil and gas in Alpine High; (2) alleges that the Company did not have the proper infrastructure in place to safely and/or economically drill and/or transport those resources even if they existed in the amounts purported; (3) alleges that these statements and omissions artificially inflated the value of the Company\u2019s operations in the Permian Basin; and (4) alleges that, as a result, the Company\u2019s public statements were materially false and misleading. Other lawsuits have followed with similar allegations. The Company believes that all plaintiffs\u2019 claims lack merit and intends to vigorously defend these lawsuits.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Company, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations and subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages. In some instances, the Company may be directed to suspend or cease operations in the affected area. The Company maintains insurance coverage, which it believes is customary in the industry, although the Company is not fully insured against all environmental risks.\nThe Company manages its exposure to environmental liabilities on properties to be acquired by identifying existing problems and assessing the potential liability. The Company also conducts periodic reviews, on a Company-wide basis, to identify changes in its environmental risk profile. These reviews evaluate whether there is a probable liability, the amount, and the likelihood that the liability will be incurred. The amount of any potential liability is determined by considering, among other matters, incremental direct costs of any likely remediation and the proportionate cost of employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of time directly to any possible remediation effort. As it relates to evaluations of purchased properties, depending on the extent of an identified environmental problem, the Company may exclude a property from the acquisition, require the seller to remediate the property to the Company\u2019s satisfaction, or agree to assume liability for the remediation of the property. The Company\u2019s general policy is to limit any reserve additions to any incidents or sites that are considered probable to result in an expected remediation cost exceeding $300,000. Any environmental costs and liabilities that are not reserved for are treated as an expense when actually incurred. In the Company\u2019s estimation, neither these expenses nor expenses related to training and compliance programs are likely to have a material impact on its financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had an undiscounted reserve for environmental remediation of approximately $2 million.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nOn September 11, 2020, the Company received a Notice of Violation and Finding of Violation, and accompanying Clean Air Act Information Request, from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) following site inspections in April 2019 at several of the Company\u2019s oil and natural gas production facilities in Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico. The notice and information request involve alleged emissions control and reporting violations. The Company is cooperating with the EPA and responding to the information request. The EPA has not commenced enforcement proceedings, and at this time the Company is unable to reasonably estimate whether such proceedings will result in monetary sanctions and, if so, whether they would be more or less than $100,000, exclusive of interest and costs.\nAdditionally, on December 29, 2020, the Company received a Notice of Violation and Opportunity to Confer, and accompanying Clean Air Act Information Request, from the EPA relating to several of the Company\u2019s oil and natural gas production facilities in Reeves County, Texas. The notice and information request involve alleged emissions control and reporting violations. The Company is cooperating with the EPA and responding to the information request. The EPA has not commenced enforcement proceedings, and at this time the Company is unable to reasonably estimate whether such proceedings will result in monetary sanctions and, if so, whether they would be more or less than $100,000, exclusive of interest and costs.\nThe Company is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of December 31, 2020 that have not been provided for or would otherwise have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that current regulatory requirements will not change or past non-compliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on the Company\u2019s properties.\nPotential Asset Retirement Obligations\nIn 2013, the Company sold its Gulf of Mexico Shelf operations and properties (Transferred Assets) to Fieldwood Energy LLC (Fieldwood). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company received cash consideration of $3.75 billion and Fieldwood assumed $1.5 billion of discounted asset abandonment liabilities as of the disposition date. In respect of such abandonment liabilities, Fieldwood posted letters of credit in favor of the Company (Letters of Credit) and established a trust account (Trust A), which is funded by a 10 percent net profits interest depending on future oil prices and of which the Company is the beneficiary. On February 14, 2018, Fieldwood filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In connection with the 2018 bankruptcy, Fieldwood confirmed a plan under which the Company agreed, inter alia, to accept bonds in exchange for certain of the Letters of Credit. Currently, the Company holds two bonds (Bonds) and the remaining Letters of Credit to secure Fieldwood\u2019s asset retirement obligations (AROs) on the Transferred Assets as and when such abandonment and decommissioning obligations are required to be performed over the remaining life of the Transferred Assets.\nOn August 3, 2020, Fieldwood again filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Fieldwood has submitted a plan of reorganization, and the Company has been engaged in discussions with Fieldwood and other interested parties regarding such plan. If approved by the bankruptcy court, the submitted plan would separate the Transferred Assets into a standalone company, and proceeds of production of the Transferred Assets will be used for the AROs. If the proceeds of production are insufficient for such AROs, then Apache expects that it may be required by the relevant governmental authorities to perform such AROs, in which case it will apply the Bonds, remaining Letters of Credit, and Trust A to pay for the AROs. In addition, after such sources have been exhausted, Apache has agreed to provide a standby loan of up to $400 million for the new company to perform decommissioning, with such standby loan secured by a first and prior lien on the Transferred Assets. If the foregoing is insufficient, the Company may be forced to use available cash to cover any additional costs it incurs for performing such AROs.\nLeases and Contractual Obligations\nOn January 1, 2019, Apache adopted ASU 2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842),\u201d which requires lessees to recognize separate right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for most leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. As allowed under the standard, the Company applied practical expedients permitting an entity the option to not evaluate under ASU 2016-02 those existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases, as well as permitting an entity the option to carry forward its historical assessments of whether existing agreements contain a lease, classification of existing lease agreements, and treatment of initial direct lease costs.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is an operating or finance lease at the inception of each contract. If the contract is classified as an operating lease, Apache records an ROU asset and corresponding liability reflecting the total remaining present value of fixed lease payments over the expected term of the lease agreement. The expected term of the lease may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. If the Company\u2019s lease does not provide an implicit rate in the contract, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate when calculating the present value. In the normal course of business, Apache enters into various lease agreements for real estate, drilling rigs, vessels, aircrafts, and equipment related to its exploration and development activities, which are typically classified as operating leases under the provisions of the standard. ROU assets are reflected within \u201cDeferred charges and other\u201d within \u201cOther\u201d assets on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet, and the associated operating lease liabilities are reflected within \u201cOther current liabilities\u201d and \u201cOther\u201d within \u201cDeferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities,\u201d as applicable.\nOperating lease expense associated with ROU assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense is reflected on the statement of consolidated operations commensurate with the leased activities and nature of the services performed. Gross fixed operating lease expense, inclusive of amounts billable to partners and other working interest owners, was $149 million and $222 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Apache elected to exclude short-term leases (those with terms of 12 months or less) from the balance sheet presentation. Costs incurred for short-term leases, which is primarily related to drilling activities in Block 58 offshore Suriname, was $80 million and $18 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn addition, the Company periodically enters into finance leases that are similar to those leases classified as capital leases under previous GAAP. Finance lease assets are included in \u201cOther\u201d within \u201cProperty and Equipment\u201d on the consolidated balance sheet, and the associated finance lease liabilities are reflected within \u201cCurrent debt\u201d and \u201cLong-term debt,\u201d as applicable. Depreciation on the Company\u2019s finance lease asset was $2 million and $7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Interest on the Company\u2019s finance lease assets was $2 million and $3 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following table represents the Company\u2019s weighted average lease term and discount rate as of December 31, 2020:\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAt December 31, 2020, contractual obligations for long-term operating leases, finance leases, and purchase obligations are as follows:\n(1)Excludes commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities for which the Company is not the operator.\n(2)Amounts represent future payments associated with oil and gas operations inclusive of amounts billable to partners and other working interest owners. Such payments may be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties and subsequently depreciated, impaired, or written off as exploration expense.\n(3)Amounts represent the Company\u2019s finance lease obligation related to the Company\u2019s Midland, Texas regional office building.\n(4)Amounts represent any agreement to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These include minimum commitments associated with take-or-pay contracts, NGL processing agreements, drilling work program commitments, and agreements to secure capacity rights on third-party pipelines. Amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing and trading activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable. Total costs incurred under take-or-pay and throughput obligations were $120 million, $111 million, and $132 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nThe lease liability reflected in the table above represents the Company\u2019s fixed minimum payments that are settled in accordance with the lease terms. Actual lease payments during the period may also include variable lease components such as common area maintenance, usage-based sales taxes and rate differentials, or other similar costs that are not determinable at the inception of the lease. Gross variable lease payments, inclusive of amounts billable to partners and other working interest owners was $41 million and $78 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAs a result of electing the transitional practical expedient to apply the provisions of the standard at its adoption date instead of the earliest comparative period presented, below are the required ASU Leases (Topic 840) disclosures for prior periods:\n(1)Includes leases for buildings, facilities, and related equipment with varying expiration dates through 2042. Total rent expense, net of amounts capitalized and sublease income was $76 million in 2018.\n(2)This represents the Company\u2019s capital lease obligation related to its Midland, Texas office building. The imputed interest rate necessary to reduce the net minimum lease payments to present value of the lease term is 4.4 percent, or $16 million as of December 31, 2018.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n12. RETIREMENT AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS\nApache Corporation provides retirement benefits to its U.S. employees through the use of multiple plans: a 401(k) savings plan, a money purchase retirement plan, a non-qualified retirement savings plan, and a non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan. The 401(k) savings plan provides participating employees the ability to elect to contribute up to 50 percent of eligible compensation, as defined, to the plan with the Company making matching contributions up to a maximum of 8 percent of each employee\u2019s annual eligible compensation. In addition, the Company contributes 6 percent of each participating employee\u2019s annual eligible compensation to a money purchase retirement plan. The 401(k) savings plan and the money purchase retirement plan are subject to certain annually-adjusted, government-mandated restrictions that limit the amount of employee and Company contributions. For certain eligible employees, the Company also provides a non-qualified retirement savings plan or a non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan. These plans allow the deferral of up to 50 percent of eligible employee\u2019s base salary, up to 75 percent of each employee\u2019s annual bonus (that accepts employee contributions) and the Company\u2019s matching contributions in excess of the government mandated limitations imposed in the 401(k) savings plan and money purchase retirement plan.\nVesting in the Company\u2019s contributions in the 401(k) savings plan, the money purchase retirement plan, the non-qualified retirement savings plan and the non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan occurs at the rate of 20 percent for every completed year of employment. Upon a change in control of ownership of Apache Corporation, immediate and full vesting occurs.\nAdditionally, Apache North Sea Limited maintains a separate retirement plan, as required under the laws of the U.K.\nThe aggregate annual cost to Apache of all U.S. and international savings plans, the money purchase retirement plan, non-qualified retirement savings plan, and non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan was $43 million, $52 million, and $52 million for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nApache also provides a funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (U.K. Pension Plan) covering certain employees of the Company\u2019s North Sea operations in the U.K. The plan provides defined pension benefits based on years of service and final salary. The plan applies only to employees who were part of BP North Sea\u2019s pension plan as of April 2, 2003, prior to the acquisition of BP North Sea by the Company effective July 1, 2003.\nAdditionally, the Company offers postretirement medical benefits to U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Eligible participants receive medical benefits up until the age of 65 or at the date they become eligible for Medicare, provided the participant remits the required portion of the cost of coverage. The plan is contributory with participants\u2019 contributions adjusted annually. The postretirement benefit plan does not cover benefit expenses once a covered participant becomes eligible for Medicare.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following tables set forth the benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets and funded status as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, and the underlying weighted average actuarial assumptions used for the U.K. Pension Plan and U.S. postretirement benefit plan. Apache uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the accumulated benefit obligation for the U.K. Pension Plan was $207 million, $181 million, and $167 million, respectively.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nApache\u2019s defined benefit pension plan assets are held by a non-related trustee who has been instructed to invest the assets in a blend of equity securities and low-risk debt securities. The Company intends that this blend of investments will provide a reasonable rate of return such that the benefits promised to members are provided. The U.K. Pension Plan policy is to target an ongoing funding level of 100 percent through prudent investments and includes policies and strategies such as investment goals, risk management practices, and permitted and prohibited investments. A breakout of previous allocations for plan asset holdings and the target allocation for the Company\u2019s plan assets are summarized below:\nThe plan\u2019s assets do not include any direct ownership of equity or debt securities of Apache. The fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets, which is a Level 1 fair value measurement. The following tables present the fair values of plan assets for each major asset category based on the nature and significant concentration of risks in plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions are derived relative to the yield on long-dated fixed-interest bonds issued by the U.K. government (gilts). For equities, outperformance relative to gilts is assumed to be 3.5 percent per year.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following tables set forth the components of the net periodic cost and the underlying weighted average actuarial assumptions used for the pension and postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nApache expects to contribute approximately $5 million to its pension plan and $2 million to its postretirement benefit plan in 2021. The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n13. REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST - ALTUS\nPreferred Units Issuance\nOn June 12, 2019, Altus Midstream LP issued and sold Preferred Units for an aggregate issue price of $625 million in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Closing). Altus Midstream LP received approximately $611 million in cash proceeds from the sale after deducting transaction costs and discounts to certain purchasers. Pursuant to the partnership agreement of Altus Midstream LP:\n\u2022The Preferred Units bear quarterly distributions at a rate of 7 percent per annum, increasing to 10 percent per annum after the fifth anniversary of Closing and upon the occurrence of specified events. Altus Midstream LP may pay distributions in-kind for the first six quarters after the Preferred Units are issued.\n\u2022The Preferred Units are redeemable at Altus Midstream LP\u2019s option at any time in cash at a redemption price (the Redemption Price) equal to the greater of an 11.5 percent internal rate of return (increasing after the fifth anniversary of Closing to 13.75 percent) and a 1.3x multiple of invested capital. The Preferred Units will be redeemable at the holder\u2019s option upon a change of control or liquidation of Altus Midstream LP and certain other events, including certain asset dispositions.\n\u2022The Preferred Units will be exchangeable for shares of ALTM\u2019s Class A common stock at the holder\u2019s election after the seventh anniversary of Closing or upon the occurrence of specified events. Each Preferred Unit will be exchangeable for a number of shares of ALTM\u2019s Class A common stock equal to the Redemption Price divided by the volume-weighted average trading price of ALTM\u2019s Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the second trading day prior to the applicable exchange date, less a 6 percent discount.\n\u2022Each outstanding Preferred Unit has a liquidation preference equal to the Redemption Price payable before any amounts are paid in respect of Altus Midstream LP\u2019s common units and any other units that rank junior to the Preferred Units with respect to distributions or distributions upon liquidation.\n\u2022Preferred Units holders have rights to approve certain partnership business, financial, and governance-related matters.\n\u2022Altus Midstream LP is restricted from declaring or making cash distributions on its common units until all required distributions on the Preferred Units have been paid. In addition, before the fifth anniversary of Closing, aggregate cash distributions on, and redemptions of, Altus Midstream LP\u2019s common units are limited to $650 million of cash from ordinary course operations if permitted under its credit facility. Cash distributions on, and redemptions of, Altus Midstream LP\u2019s common units also are subject to satisfaction of leverage ratio requirements specified in its partnership agreement.\nClassification\nThe Preferred Units are accounted for on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets as a redeemable noncontrolling interest classified as temporary equity based on the terms of the Preferred Units, including the redemption rights with respect thereto.\nInitial Measurement\nAltus recorded the net transaction price of $611 million, calculated as the negotiated transaction price of $625 million, less issue discounts of $4 million and transaction costs totaling $10 million.\nCertain redemption features embedded within the terms of the Preferred Units require bifurcation and measurement at fair value. Altus bifurcated and recognized at fair value an embedded derivative related to the Preferred Units at inception of $94 million for a redemption option of the Preferred Unit holders. The derivative is reflected in \u201cOther\u201d within \u201cDeferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities\u201d on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet at its current fair value of $139 million as of December 31, 2020. The fair value of the embedded derivative, a Level 3 fair value measurement, was based on numerous factors including expected future interest rates using the Black-Karasinski model, Altus\u2019 imputed interest rate, the timing of periodic cash distributions, and dividend yields of the Preferred Units. See Note 4-Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for more detail.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe net transaction price was allocated to the preferred redeemable noncontrolling interest and the embedded features according to the associated initial fair value measurements as follows:\nSubsequent Measurement\nAltus applies a two-step approach to subsequent measurement of the redeemable noncontrolling interest related to the Preferred Units by first allocating a portion of the net income of Altus Midstream LP in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement. An additional adjustment to the carrying value of the Preferred Unit redeemable noncontrolling interest at each period end may be recorded, if applicable. The amount of such adjustment is determined based upon the accreted value method to reflect the passage of time until the Preferred Units are exchangeable at the option of the holder. Pursuant to this method, the net transaction price is accreted using the effective interest method to the Redemption Price calculated at the seventh anniversary of the Closing. The total adjustment is limited to an amount such that the carrying amount of the Preferred Unit redeemable noncontrolling interest at each period end is equal to the greater of (a) the sum of (i) the carrying amount of the Preferred Units, plus (ii) the fair value of the embedded derivative liability and (b) the accreted value of the net transaction price.\nActivity related to the Preferred Units for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\n(1)The Preferred Units are redeemable at Altus Midstream\u2019s option at a redemption price (the Redemption Price), which as of December 31, 2020 was the greater of (i) an 11.5 percent internal rate of return and (ii) a 1.3 times multiple of invested capital. As of December 31, 2020, the Redemption Price would have been based on 1.3 times multiple of invested capital, which was $813 million and greater than using an 11.5 percent internal rate of return, which was $717 million.\nN/A - not applicable.\n14. CAPITAL STOCK\nCommon Stock Outstanding\nThe following table provides changes to the Company\u2019s common shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNet Income (Loss) per Common Share\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the components of basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nThe diluted EPS calculation excludes options and restricted shares that were anti-dilutive totaling 4.5 million, 5.0 million, and 5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The impact to net income (loss) attributable to common stock on an assumed conversion of the redeemable noncontrolling Preferred Units interest in Altus Midstream LP was anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn 2013 and 2014, Apache\u2019s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 40 million shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Shares may be purchased either in the open market or through privately held negotiated transactions. The Company initiated the buyback program on June 10, 2013, and, through December 31, 2020, had repurchased a total of 40 million shares at an average price of $79.18 per share. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 40 million additional shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company is not obligated to acquire any specific number of shares and did not purchase any shares during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCommon Stock Dividend\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Board of Directors approved a reduction in the Company\u2019s quarterly dividends from $0.25 per share to $0.025 per share, effective for all dividends payable after March 12, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company declared common stock dividends of $0.10 per share. For each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company declared common stock dividends of $1.00 per share.\nStock Compensation Plans\nThe Company maintains several stock-based compensation plans, which include stock options, restricted stock, and conditional restricted stock unit plans. On May 12, 2016, the Company\u2019s shareholders approved the 2016 Omnibus Compensation Plan (the 2016 Plan), which is used to provide eligible employees with equity-based incentives by granting incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, performance awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, cash awards, or any combination of the foregoing. As of December 31, 2020, 14.1 million shares were authorized and available for grant under the 2016 Plan. Previously approved plans remain in effect solely for the purpose of governing grants still outstanding that were issued prior to approval of the 2016 Plan. All new grants are issued from the 2016 Plan. In 2018, the Company began issuing cash-settled awards (phantom units) under the restricted stock and conditional restricted stock unit plans. The phantom units represent a hypothetical interest in the Company\u2019s stock and, once vested, are settled in cash.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nCosts related to the plans are capitalized or expensed to \u201cLease operating expenses,\u201d \u201cExploration,\u201d or \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d in the Company\u2019s statement of consolidated operations based on the nature of each employee\u2019s activities. The following table summarizes the Company\u2019s stock-settled and cash-settled compensation costs:\nStock Options\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding options to purchase shares of its common stock under the 2016 Plan, the 2011 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2011 Plan), and the 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2007 Plan), (collectively, the Omnibus Plans). The Omnibus Plans were submitted to and approved by the Company\u2019s shareholders. New shares of common stock will be issued for employee stock option exercises. Under the Omnibus Plans, the exercise price of each option equals the closing price of Apache\u2019s common stock on the date of grant. Options granted become exercisable ratably over a three-year period and expire 10 years after granted.\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\n(1)As of December 31, 2020, options outstanding had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.6 years and no intrinsic value.\n(2)As of December 31, 2020, options expected to vest had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 7.0 years and no intrinsic value.\n(3)As of December 31, 2020, options exercisable had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 3.4 years and no intrinsic value.\nThe fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, a Level 2 fair value measurement. The following table summarizes specific assumptions used in the Company\u2019s valuation:\nN/A - not applicable.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAssumptions related to the expected volatilities are based on the Company\u2019s historical volatility of its common stock and other factors. The expected dividend yield is based on historical yields on the date of grant. The expected term of stock options granted represents the period of time that the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is derived from historical exercise behavior, current trends, and values derived from lattice-based models. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nThere were no options issued and no options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The intrinsic values of options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $0.1 million. As of December 31, 2020, total compensation cost related to non-vested options not yet recognized was nil because they fully vest on January 5, 2021.\nRestricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Phantom Units\nThe Company has restricted stock unit and restricted stock phantom unit plans for eligible employees, including officers. The value of the stock-settled restricted stock unit awards is established by the market price on the date of grant and is recorded as compensation expense ratably over the vesting terms. The restricted stock phantom unit awards represent a hypothetical interest in either the Company\u2019s stock or in ALTM\u2019s common stock, as applicable, and, once vested, are settled in cash. Compensation expense related to the cash-settled awards is recorded as a liability and remeasured at the end of each reporting period over the applicable vesting term. The cash-settled awards compensation expense is recorded as a liability and remeasured at the end of each reporting period over the applicable vesting term.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, compensation costs charged to expense for the restricted stock units and restricted stock phantom units was $39 million, $104 million, and $101 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, capitalized compensation costs for the restricted stock units and restricted stock phantom units were $6 million, $24 million, and $29 million, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes stock-settled restricted stock unit activity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\n(1)As of December 31, 2020, there was $14 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to 1,551,807 unvested stock-settled restricted stock units.\n(2)As of December 31, 2020, the weighted-average remaining life of unvested stock-settled restricted stock units is approximately 0.7 years.\n(3)The grant date fair values of the stock-settled awards vested during 2020, 2019, and 2018 were approximately $94 million, $103 million, and $111 million, respectively.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes cash-settled restricted stock phantom unit activity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\n(1)On June 30, 2020, Altus executed a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock. Outstanding cash-settled awards are based on the per-share market price of ALTM stock.\n(2)Restricted stock phantom units granted during 2020 and 2019 included 3,378,486 and 3,401,477 awards, respectively, based on the per-share market price of Apache common stock and 83,239 and 1,429,135 awards, respectively, based on the per-share market price of ALTM common stock. The restricted stock phantom units granted during 2020 based on ALTM\u2019s per-share market price reflect the 1-for-20 reverse stock split described above.\n(3)The outstanding liability for the unvested cash-settled restricted stock phantom units that had not been recognized as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $28 million.\nIn January 2021, the Company awarded 1,354,349 restricted stock units and 4,360,656 restricted stock phantom units based on Apache\u2019s weighted-average per-share market price of $16.18 under the 2016 Plan to eligible employees. Total compensation cost for the restricted stock units and the restricted stock phantom units, absent any forfeitures, is estimated to be $22 million and $71 million, respectively, and was calculated based on the per-share fair market value of a share of the Company\u2019s common stock as of the grant date. Compensation cost will be recognized over a three-year vesting period for both plans. The phantom units will be classified as a liability and remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the change in fair value of one share of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nAlso during January 2021, the Company awarded 56,836 restricted stock phantom units based on ALTM\u2019s weighted-average per-share market price of $48.84. The restricted stock phantom units represent a hypothetical interest in ALTM\u2019s common stock and, once vested, are settled in cash. Total compensation cost for these restricted stock phantom units, absent any forfeitures, is estimated to be $3 million and was calculated based on the fair market value of ALTM\u2019s common stock as of the grant date. The restricted stock phantom units will be classified as a liability and remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the change in fair value of one share of ALTM\u2019s common stock.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nPerformance Program\nTo provide long-term incentives for the Company\u2019s employees to deliver competitive shareholder returns, the Company makes annual grants of conditional restricted stock units to eligible employees. Apache has a performance program for certain eligible employees with payout for 50 percent of the shares based upon measurement of total shareholder return (TSR) of Apache common stock as compared to a designated peer group during a three-year performance period. Payout for the remaining 50 percent of the shares is based on performance and financial objectives as defined in the plan. The overall results of the objectives are calculated at the end of the award\u2019s stated performance period and, if a payout is warranted, applied to the target number of restricted stock units awarded. The performance shares will immediately vest 50 percent at the end of the three-year performance period, with the remaining 50 percent vesting at the end of the following year. Grants from the performance programs outstanding at December 31, 2020, are as described below:\n\u2022In January 2017, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved the 2017 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Eligible employees received initial stock-settled conditional restricted stock unit awards totaling 620,885 units. A total of 111,126 restricted stock units were outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The results for the performance period yielded a payout of 54 percent of target.\n\u2022In January 2018, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved the 2018 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Eligible employees received initial cash-settled conditional phantom units totaling 931,049 units. A total of 704,483 phantom units were outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The results for the performance period yielded a payout of 23 percent of target.\n\u2022In January 2019, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved the 2019 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Eligible employees received initial cash-settled conditional phantom units totaling 1,679,832 units. The actual amount of phantom units awarded will be between zero and 200 percent of target. A total of 1,301,893 phantom units were outstanding as of December 31, 2020, from which a minimum of zero to a maximum of 2,603,786 phantom units could be awarded.\n\u2022In January 2020, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved the 2020 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Eligible employees received initial cash-settled conditional phantom units totaling 1,687,307 units. The actual amount of phantom units awarded will be between zero and 200 percent of target. A total of 1,410,404 phantom units were outstanding as of December 31, 2020, from which a minimum of zero to a maximum of 2,820,808 phantom units could be awarded.\nThe fair value cost of the stock-settled awards was estimated on the date of grant and is recorded as compensation expense ratably over the applicable vesting term. The fair value of the cash-settled awards is remeasured at the end of each reporting period over the applicable vesting term. Compensation cost charged to expense under the performance programs was a credit of $8 million during 2020 and expenses of $24 million and $38 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. Capitalized compensation costs under the performance programs was a credit of $1 million during 2020 and expenses of $3 million and $7 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes stock-settled conditional restricted stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n(1)The fair value of each conditional restricted stock unit award is estimated as of the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation with the following assumptions used for all grants made under the plan: (i) a three-year continuous risk-free interest rate; (ii) a constant volatility assumption based on the historical realized stock price volatility of the Company and the designated peer group; and (iii) the historical stock prices and expected dividends of the common stock of the Company and its designated peer group.\n(2)As of December 31, 2020, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to 111,126 unvested stock-settled conditional restricted stock units.\n(3)As of December 31, 2020, the weighted-average remaining life of the unvested stock-settled conditional restricted stock units is approximately 0.0 years.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes cash-settled conditional restricted stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n(1)As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding liability for the unvested cash-settled conditional restricted stock units that had not been recognized was approximately $14 million.\nIn January 2021, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved the 2021 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Payout for 50 percent of the shares is based upon measurement of TSR of Apache common stock as compared to a designated peer group and the S&P 500 Index during a three-year performance period. Payout for the remaining 50 percent of the shares is based on performance and financial objectives as defined in the plan. Eligible employees received the initial cash-settled conditional phantom units totaling 1,911,517 units, with the ultimate number of phantom units to be awarded ranging from zero to a maximum of 3,823,034 units. These phantom units represent a hypothetical interest in the Company\u2019s stock, and, once vested, are settled in cash. The TSR component of the award had a grant date fair value per award of $23.73 based on a Monte Carlo simulation. The grant date fair value per award for the remaining 50 percent was $16.18 based on the weighted-average fair market value of a share of common stock of the Company as of the grant date. These phantom units will be classified as a liability and remeasured at the end of each reporting period.\n15. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nComponents of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) include the following:\n16. MAJOR CUSTOMERS\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. During 2020, sales to EGPC and Vitol accounted for approximately 17 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of the Company\u2019s worldwide crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs production revenues. During 2019, sales to BP and Sinopec, and their respective affiliates, each accounted for approximately 10 percent and 11 percent, respectively, of the Company\u2019s worldwide crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs production revenues. During 2018, sales to BP, Sinopec, and EGPC, and their respective affiliates, each accounted for approximately 17 percent, 15 percent, and 10 percent, respectively, of the Company\u2019s worldwide crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs production revenues.\nManagement does not believe that the loss of any one of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n17. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION\nAs of December 31, 2020, Apache is engaged in exploration and production (Upstream) activities across three operating segments: Egypt, North Sea, and the U.S. Apache also has active exploration and planned appraisal operations ongoing in Suriname, as well as interests in other international locations that may, over time, result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities. Apache\u2019s Upstream business explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. During 2018, Apache established a new reporting segment for its U.S. midstream business separate from its upstream oil and gas development activities. The midstream business is operated by Altus, which owns, develops, and operates a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas. Financial information for each segment is presented below:\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(1)Includes revenue from non-customers for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 of:\n(2)Includes a noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Altus Midstream.\n(3)Intercompany balances are excluded from total assets.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n18.

Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the \u201ceconomic interest\u201d method, which excludes the host country\u2019s share of reserves.\nEstimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the \u201cproved\u201d classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active, improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based. Economically producible means a resource that generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. Reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In estimating its proved reserves, Apache uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy with similar properties. Apache will, at times, utilize additional technical analysis such as computer reservoir models, petrophysical techniques, and proprietary 3-D seismic interpretation methods to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs. Information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of the Company\u2019s reserve estimates.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures. The reserve data in the following tables only represent estimates and should not be construed as being exact.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(1)Includes proved reserves of 36 MMbbls, 38 MMbbls, 40 MMbbls, and 47 MMbbls as of December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(1) Includes proved reserves of 281 Mbbls, 252 Mbbls, 187 Mbbls, and 241 Mbbls as of December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(1) Includes proved reserves of 141 Bcf, 153 Bcf, 170 Bcf, and 196 Bcf as of December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n(1) Includes include total proved reserves of 59 MMboe, 64 MMboe, 68 MMboe, and 80 MMboe as of December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt.\nDuring 2020, Apache added approximately 78 MMboe from extensions, discoveries, and other additions. The Company recorded 39 MMboe of exploration and development adds in the U.S., primarily in the Southern Midland Basin (26 MMboe) associated with the Wolfcamp and Spraberry drilling programs and the remainder in the Delaware Basin and Austin Chalk. The international operations contributed 39 MMboe of exploration and development adds during 2020, with Egypt contributing 32 MMboe from onshore exploration and appraisal activity primarily in the Khalda Area and Umbarka Area concessions. The North Sea contributed 7 MMboe from drilling success, primarily in the Beryl Field. The Company had combined downward revisions of previously estimated reserves of 45 MMboe. Downward revisions related to changes in product prices accounted for 70 MMboe, engineering and performance upward revisions accounted for 27 MMboe, and downward interest revisions accounted for 2 MMboe. The Company also sold 10 MMboe of proved reserves associated with U.S. divestitures, primarily related to Eastern Shelf and Magnet Withers/Pickett Ridge.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDuring 2019, Apache added approximately 176 MMboe from extensions, discoveries, and other additions. The Company recorded 135 MMboe of exploration and development adds in the U.S., primarily associated with Woodford, Bone Springs, Spraberry, Barnett, and Wolfcamp drilling programs in the Permian Basin (129 MMboe) and various offset drilling activity in the Midcontinent region (6 MMboe). The Company\u2019s international assets contributed 41 MMboe of exploration and development adds during 2019. Egypt contributed 27 MMboe from onshore exploration and appraisal activity in the Khalda Extension 2, Khalda, Khalda Extension 3, East Bahariya Extension 3, and West Kanayis concessions. The North Sea contributed 14 MMboe from drilling success in the Beryl and Forties fields. The Company had combined downward revisions of previously estimated reserves of 119 MMboe. Downward revisions related to changes in product prices accounted for 139 MMboe and engineering and performance upward revisions accounted for 20 MMboe. The Company also sold 107 MMboe of proved reserves associated with U.S. divestitures, primarily related to the sale of the Company\u2019s Woodford-SCOOP and STACK plays and western Anadarko Basin assets.\nDuring 2018, Apache added approximately 303 MMboe from extensions, discoveries, and other additions. The Company recorded 240 MMboe of exploration and development adds in the U.S., primarily associated with Woodford, Bone Springs, Yeso, Barnett, and Wolfcamp drilling programs in the Permian Basin (217 MMboe) and Woodford and Austin Chalk drilling activity in the Midcontinent region (20 MMboe). The Company\u2019s international assets contributed 62 MMboe of exploration and development adds during 2018. Egypt contributed 36 MMboe from onshore exploration and appraisal activity in the Khalda Extension 2, Khalda, Khalda Extension 3, Matruh, and West Kalabsha concessions. The North Sea contributed 26 MMboe from drilling success in the Beryl and Forties fields. The Company had combined downward revisions of previously estimated reserves of 73 MMboe. Downward revisions related to changes in product prices accounted for 24 MMboe, interest revisions accounted for 5 MMboe, and engineering and performance downward revisions accounted for 44 MMboe.\nApproximately 10 percent of the Company\u2019s year-end 2020 estimated proved developed reserves are classified as proved not producing. These reserves relate to zones that are either behind pipe, or that have been completed but not yet produced, or zones that have been produced in the past, but are not now producing because of mechanical reasons. These reserves are considered to be a lower tier of reserves than producing reserves because they are frequently based on volumetric calculations rather than performance data. Future production associated with behind pipe reserves is scheduled to follow depletion of the currently producing zones in the same wellbores. Additional capital may have to be spent to access these reserves. The capital and economic impact of production timing are reflected in this Note 18, under \u201cFuture Net Cash Flows.\u201d\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nFuture Net Cash Flows\nFuture cash inflows as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of oil and gas prices in effect on the first day of each month in the respective year, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation. Future development costs include abandonment and dismantlement costs.\nThe following table sets forth unaudited information concerning future net cash flows for proved oil and gas reserves, net of income tax expense. Income tax expense has been computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available, under current laws, and which relate to oil and gas producing activities. This information does not purport to present the fair market value of the Company\u2019s oil and gas assets, but does present a standardized disclosure concerning possible future net cash flows that would result under the assumptions used.\n(1)Includes discounted future net cash flows of approximately $563 million, $1.0 billion, and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt.\n(2)Estimated future net cash flows before income tax expense, discounted at 10 percent per annum, totaled approximately $7.1 billion, $12.4 billion, and $16.9 billion as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nAPACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following table sets forth the principal sources of change in the discounted future net cash flows:"
