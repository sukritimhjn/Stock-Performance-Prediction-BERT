    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nUnum Group, a Delaware general business corporation, and its insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries, which collectively with Unum Group we refer to as the Company, operate in the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, and, to a limited extent, in certain other countries. The principal operating subsidiaries in the United States are Unum Life Insurance Company of America (Unum America), Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company (Provident), The Paul Revere Life Insurance Company (Paul Revere Life), Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company, Starmount Life Insurance Company (Starmount Life), in the United Kingdom, Unum Limited, and in Poland, Unum Zycie TUiR S.A. (Unum Poland). We are a leading provider of financial protection benefits in the United States and the United Kingdom. Our products include disability, life, accident, critical illness, dental and vision, and other related services. We market our products primarily through the workplace.\nWe have three principal operating business segments: Unum US, Unum International, and Colonial Life. Our other segments are the Closed Block and Corporate segments. These segments are discussed more fully under \"Reporting Segments\" included herein in this Item 1.\nBusiness Strategies\nThe benefits we provide help the working world thrive throughout life's moments and protect people from the financial hardship of illness, injury, or loss of life by providing support when it is needed most. As a leading provider of employee benefits, we offer a broad portfolio of products and services through the workplace.\nSpecifically, we offer group, individual, voluntary, and dental and vision products as well as provide certain fee-based services. These products and services, which can be sold stand-alone or combined with other coverages, help employers of all sizes attract and retain a stronger workforce while protecting the incomes and livelihood of their employees. We believe employer-sponsored benefits are the most effective way to provide workers with access to information and options to protect their financial stability. Working people and their families, particularly those at lower and middle incomes, are perhaps the most vulnerable in today's economy yet are often overlooked by many providers of financial services and products. For many of these people, employer-sponsored benefits are the primary defense against the potentially catastrophic fallout of death, illness, or injury.\nWe have established a corporate culture consistent with the social values our products provide. Because we see important links between the obligations we have to all of our stakeholders, we place a strong emphasis on operating with integrity and contributing to positive change in our communities. Accordingly, we are committed not only to meeting the needs of our customers who depend on us, but also to being accountable for our actions through sound and consistent business practices, a strong internal compliance program, a comprehensive risk management strategy, and an engaged employee workforce.\nWe believe our disciplined approach to providing financial protection products at the workplace puts us in a position of strength. The products and services we provide have never been more important to employers, employees and their families, especially given the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our strategy remains centered on growing our core businesses through investing and transforming our operations and technology to anticipate and respond to the changing needs of our customers, expand into new adjacent markets through meaningful partnerships and effective deployment of our capital across our portfolio.\nAlthough the current environment continues to place pressure on our profit margins, we continue to analyze and employ strategies we believe will help us navigate the current environment and allow us to maintain financial flexibility to support the needs of our businesses while also allowing us to return capital to our shareholders. Improvements in the U.S. labor market and consumer confidence levels will have positive impacts on our business. We have substantial leverage to rising interest rates and an improving economy which generates payroll growth and wage inflation. Long-term, we believe that consistent operating results, combined with the implementation of strategic initiatives and the effective deployment of capital, will allow us to meet our financial objectives.\nReporting Segments\nOur reporting segments are comprised of the following: Unum US, Unum International, Colonial Life, Closed Block, and Corporate. The percentage of consolidated premium income generated by each reporting segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 is as follows:\nFinancial information is provided in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" contained herein in Item 7 and Note 13 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8.\nUnum US Segment\nOur Unum US segment is comprised of group disability insurance, which includes our long-term and short-term disability products, our medical stop-loss product, and our fee-based leave management services and administrative services only (ASO) business, group life and accidental death and dismemberment products, and supplemental and voluntary lines of business, which include individual disability, voluntary benefits, and dental and vision products. Unum US products are issued primarily by Unum America, Provident, and Starmount Life. Paul Revere Life previously issued products reported in our Unum US segment and continues to service the in-force policies, but Paul Revere Life no longer actively markets new business. These products are marketed through our field sales personnel who work in conjunction with independent brokers and consultants. Our market strategy for Unum US is to effectively deliver an integrated offering of employee benefit products in the group core market segment, which we define for Unum US as employee groups with fewer than 2,000 employees, the group large case market segment, and the supplemental and voluntary market segment.\nThe percentage of Unum US segment premium income generated by each product line during 2020 is as follows:\nGroup Long-term and Short-term Disability\nWe sell group long-term and short-term disability products to employers for the benefit of employees.\nGroup long-term disability provides employees with insurance coverage for loss of income in the event of extended work absences due to sickness or injury. We offer services to employers and insureds to encourage and facilitate rehabilitation, retraining, and re-employment. Most policies begin providing benefits following 90 or 180 day waiting periods and continue providing benefits until the employee reaches a certain age, generally between 65 and 70, or recovers from the disability. The benefits are limited to specified maximums as a percentage of income. Also included in our long-term disability product line is our medical stop-loss product, which is designed to protect self-insured employers if their employees' medical claims exceed certain agreed upon thresholds.\nGroup short-term disability insurance generally provides coverage from loss of income due to injury or sickness for up to 26 weeks, and is limited to specified maximums as a percentage of income. Benefits are effective immediately for accidents and after one week for sickness.\nOur leave management services provide administrative services on behalf of employers to ensure the protected leave eligibility and status for employees are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. ASO products provide administrative services\nregarding claims processing and billing for self-insured customers for which the responsibility for funding claim payments remain with the customer.\nPremiums for group long-term and short-term disability are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. In some cases, coverage for large employers will include retrospective experience rating provisions or will be underwritten on an experience-rated basis. Premiums for experience-rated group long-term and short-term disability business are based on the expected experience of the client given its demographics, industry group, and location, adjusted for the credibility of the specific claim experience of the client. Both group long-term and short-term disability are sold primarily on a basis permitting periodic repricing to address the underlying claims experience. Fees for our leave management services and ASO business are generally based on the number of covered employees and an agreed-upon per-employee, per-month rate. Premiums for our medical stop-loss product are generally based on the number of covered employees in self-insured employer groups and their estimated overall health risk plus provisions for administrative expenses, and profit.\nWe have defined underwriting practices and procedures. If the coverage amount for our disability policies exceeds certain prescribed age and amount limits, we may require a prospective insured to submit evidence of insurability. Our disability policies are typically issued, both at inception and renewal, with rate guarantees. For new group policyholders, the usual rate guarantee is one to three years. For group policies being renewed, the rate guarantee is generally one year, but may be longer. The profitability of the policy depends on the adequacy of the rate during the rate guarantee period. The contracts provide for certain circumstances in which the rate guarantees can be overridden. Our medical stop loss contracts are renewable on an annual basis and rates are not guaranteed beyond one year. There is no requirement for prospective insureds to submit evidence of insurability because coverage levels are determined for the group as a whole.\nProfitability of group long-term and short-term disability insurance and our medical stop-loss product is affected by sales, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses. Morbidity is an important factor in disability claims experience, and many economic and societal factors can affect claim incidence for disability insurance. We routinely make pricing adjustments on our group long-term and short-term disability insurance products, when contractually permitted, which take into account emerging experience and external factors.\nGroup Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment\nGroup life and accidental death and dismemberment products are sold to employers as employee benefit products. Group life consists primarily of renewable term life insurance with the coverages frequently linked to employees' wages and includes a provision for waiver of premium, if disabled. Accidental death and dismemberment consists primarily of an additional benefit amount payable if death or severe injury is attributable to an accident.\nPremiums are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. Underwriting practices and rate guarantees are similar to those used for group disability products, and evidence of insurability is required for benefits in excess of a specified limit.\nProfitability of group life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance is affected by persistency, investment returns, mortality and other claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.\nIndividual Disability\nIndividual disability products are offered primarily to multi-life employer groups to supplement their group disability plans and may be funded by the employer, but the policy is owned by the employee and is portable. Individual disability insurance provides the insured with a portion of earned income lost as a result of sickness or injury. The benefits, including the underlying group disability coverage, typically range from 30 percent to 75 percent of the insured's monthly earned income. We provide various options with respect to length of benefit periods, product features, and waiting periods before benefit payments begin, which permit tailoring of the multi-life plan to a specific employer's needs. We also market individual disability policies which include payments for the transfer of business ownership between partners and payments for business overhead expenses, also on a multi-life basis. Individual disability products do not provide for the accumulation of cash values.\nPremium rates for individual disability products vary by age, product features, and occupation based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own experience. Our underwriting rules, issue limits, and plan designs reflect risk and the financial circumstances of prospective insureds. Individuals in multi-life groups may be subject to limited medical underwriting. The majority of our\nindividual disability policies are written on a noncancelable basis. Under a noncancelable policy, as long as the insured continues to pay the fixed annual premium for the policy's duration, we cannot cancel the policy or change the premium.\nProfitability of individual disability insurance is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.\nVoluntary Benefits\nVoluntary benefits products are primarily sold to groups of employees through payroll deduction at the workplace and include life, disability, accident, hospital indemnity, cancer, and critical illness offered on both a group and individual basis.\nPremium rates for voluntary benefits products are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience and published industry tables. Our underwriters evaluate the medical condition of prospective policyholders prior to the issuance of a policy on a simplified basis. Underwriting requirements may be waived for cases that meet certain criteria, including participation levels. Individual voluntary benefits products other than life insurance are offered on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in-force policies, subject to regulatory approval. Group voluntary benefits products are offered primarily on an optionally renewable basis which allows us to re-price or terminate in-force policies.\nProfitability of voluntary benefits products is affected by the level of employee participation, persistency, investment returns, mortality and other claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.\nDental and Vision\nGroup dental and vision products are sold to employers as employee benefit products. Our group dental products include a variety of insured and self-insured dental care plans including preferred provider organizations and scheduled reimbursement plans. Our group vision products provide coverage that includes a range of both in-network and out-of-network benefits for routine vision services offered either in conjunction with our dental product offerings or as stand-alone coverage.\nPremiums for small case group dental and vision products are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus a provision for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. Premiums for large employer groups are underwritten on an experience-rated basis.\nProfitability of our dental and vision products is affected by persistency, claims experience, the level of administrative expenses, and to a lesser extent, investment returns.\nUnum International Segment\nThe Unum International segment includes our operations in the United Kingdom and Poland. Unum UK's business includes insurance for group long-term disability, group life, and supplemental lines of business which include dental, individual disability, and critical illness products. Unum Poland's business primarily includes insurance for individual and group life with accident and health riders. Both Unum UK's and Unum Poland's products are sold primarily through field sales personnel and independent brokers and consultants. The market strategy for the segment is to offer benefits to employers and employees through the workplace, with a focus on the expansion of the number of employers and employees covered in our Unum UK core market segment, which we define as employee groups with fewer than 500 employees, and the growth of the existing Unum Poland business through the incorporation of our benefits and distribution expertise.\nThe percentage of Unum International segment premium income generated by each product line during 2020 is as follows:\nUnum UK Group Long-term Disability\nGroup long-term disability products are sold to employers for the benefit of employees. Group long-term disability provides employees with insurance coverage for loss of income in the event of extended work absences due to sickness or injury. Services are offered to employers and insureds to encourage and facilitate rehabilitation, retraining, and re-employment. Most policies begin providing benefits following 90 or 180 day waiting periods and continue providing benefits until the employee reaches a certain age or reaches the end of the limited period specified in the policy terms. The benefits are limited to specified maximums as a percentage of income.\nPremiums for group long-term disability are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. Some cases carry experience rating provisions. Premiums for experience-rated group long-term disability business are based on the expected experience of the client given its demographics, industry group, and location, adjusted for the credibility of the specific claim experience of the client. Policies are sold primarily on a basis permitting periodic repricing to address the underlying claims experience.\nWe have defined underwriting practices and procedures. If the coverage amount exceeds certain prescribed age and amount limits, we may require a prospective insured to submit evidence of insurability. Policies are typically issued, both at inception and renewal, with rate guarantees. The usual rate guarantee is two years but may vary depending on circumstances. The profitability of the policy is dependent upon the adequacy of the rate during the rate guarantee period. The contracts provide for certain circumstances in which the rate guarantees can be overridden.\nProfitability of group long-term disability insurance is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses. Morbidity is an important factor in disability claims experience. We routinely make pricing adjustments on our group insurance products, when contractually permitted, which take into account emerging experience and external factors.\nUnum UK Group Life\nGroup life products are sold to employers as employee benefit products. Group life consists of two types of products, a renewable term life insurance product and a group dependent life product. The renewable term life product provides a lump sum benefit to the beneficiary on death of an employee. The group dependent life product, which we discontinued offering to new customers in 2012, provides an annuity to the beneficiary upon the death of an employee. Both coverages are frequently linked to employees' wages. Premiums for group life are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. Underwriting and rate guarantees are similar to those utilized for group long-term disability products.\nProfitability of group life is affected by persistency, investment returns, mortality and other claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.\nUnum UK Supplemental\nSupplemental products are sold to individual retail customers as well as groups of employees and include individual disability, group and individual critical illness, and group dental. Individual disability products provide the insured with a portion of earned income lost as a result of sickness or injury. Critical illness products provide a lump-sum benefit on the occurrence of a covered critical illness event. Group dental products generally provide fixed benefits based on specified treatments or a portion of the cost of the treatment.\nPremiums for our individual products vary by age and are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience and published industry tables. Approximately two thirds of our individual disability policies are written on a noncancelable basis. The remainder of our individual disability policies and all of our individual critical illness products are offered on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in-force policies. Our underwriters evaluate the medical and financial condition of prospective policyholders prior to the issuance of a policy.\nPremiums for group critical illness products are generally based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. Underwriting and rate guarantees are similar to those utilized for group long-term disability products. Premiums for group dental products are generally based on standard industry rates that vary by age, with minor pricing variation based on the number of covered employees in the group.\nProfitability of our supplemental products is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.\nUnum Poland\nUnum Poland products, which include both individual and group life products, provide renewable term and whole life insurance with accident and health riders. Premiums are based on expected claims of a pool of similar risks plus provisions for administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. Profitability of our Unum Poland products is affected by persistency, investment returns, mortality and other claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.\nColonial Life Segment\nOur Colonial Life segment includes accident, sickness, and disability products, which includes our dental and vision products, life products, and cancer and critical illness products. These products are issued primarily by Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company and marketed to employees, on both a group and an individual basis, at the workplace through an independent contractor agency sales force and brokers. Our market strategy for Colonial Life is to effectively deliver a broad set of voluntary products and services in the public sector market and in the commercial market, with a particular focus on the core commercial market segment, which we define for Colonial Life as accounts with fewer than 1,000 employees.\nOur underwriters evaluate the medical condition of prospective policyholders prior to the issuance of a policy on a simplified basis. Underwriting requirements may be waived for cases that meet certain criteria, including participation levels.\nThe percentage of Colonial Life segment premium income generated by each product line during 2020 is as follows:\nAccident, Sickness, and Disability\nThe accident, sickness, and disability product line consists of short-term disability plans, accident-only plans providing benefits for injuries on a specified loss basis, and our dental and vision products. It also includes accident and health plans covering hospital admissions, confinement, and surgeries.\nPremiums for accident, sickness, and disability products are generally based on assumptions for morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own experience and published industry tables. Premiums are primarily individual guaranteed renewable for which we have the ability to change premiums on a state by state basis. A small percentage of the policies are written on a group basis which are offered primarily on an optionally renewable basis which allows us to re-price or terminate in-force policies. Premiums for our dental and vision products are guaranteed renewable with standard industry rates that vary by age and region.\nProfitability is affected by the level of employee participation, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.\nLife\nLife products are primarily comprised of universal life, whole life, and term life policies.\nPremium rates vary by age and are based on assumptions concerning mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own experience and published industry tables. Premiums for the whole life and level term products are guaranteed for the life of the contract. Premiums for the universal life products are flexible and may vary at the individual policyholder level. For the group term life products, we retain the right to change premiums at the account level based on the experience of the account.\nProfitability is affected by the level of employee participation, persistency, investment returns, mortality and other claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.\nCancer and Critical Illness\nCancer policies provide various benefits for the treatment of cancer including hospitalization, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Critical illness policies provide a lump-sum benefit and/or fixed payments on the occurrence of a covered critical illness event.\nPremiums are generally based on assumptions for morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own experience and published industry tables. Premiums are primarily individual guaranteed renewable wherein we have the ability to change premiums on a state by state basis.\nProfitability of these products is affected by the level of employee participation, persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.\nClosed Block Segment\nOur Closed Block segment consists of group and individual long-term care, individual disability, and other insurance products no longer actively marketed. Closed Block segment premium income for 2020 was comprised of approximately 68 percent group and individual long-term care and 32 percent individual disability.\nGroup and Individual Long-term Care\nWe discontinued offering individual long-term care in 2009 and group long-term care in 2012. Group long-term care was previously offered to employers for the benefit of employees. Individual long-term care was previously marketed on a single-life customer basis.\nLong-term care insurance pays a benefit upon the loss of two or more activities of daily living and the insured's requirement of standby assistance or cognitive impairment. Payment is generally made on an indemnity basis, regardless of expenses incurred, up to a lifetime maximum. Benefits begin after a waiting period, usually 90 days or less, and are generally paid for a period of three years, six years, or lifetime.\nOur long-term care insurance was sold on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in-force policies, subject to regulatory approval. Premium rates for long-term care vary by age and are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income, and profit. Premium rate increases continue to be implemented where needed and where approved by state regulators. We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience and published industry tables.\nProfitability is affected by premium rate increases, persistency, investment returns, mortality and other claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses.\nIndividual Disability\nWe began limiting sales of the types of individual disability policies reported in our Closed Block segment subsequent to the mid-1990s after substantial changes in product design were implemented to improve the overall risk profile of our offerings of individual disability products. We entirely discontinued issuing new policies in this closed block of business in 2004. The majority of the policies were written on a noncancelable basis and were marketed on a single-life customer basis. Profitability is affected by persistency, investment returns, claims experience, and the level of administrative expenses. In December 2020, we entered into a reinsurance agreement to reinsure the majority of our Closed Block individual disability products to a third party. For further discussion on this reinsurance agreement, refer to \"Reinsurance\" herein this Item 1, \"Executive Summary\" and \"Segment Results\" contained herein in Item 7, and Note 12 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8.\nOther\nOther insurance products not actively marketed include group pension, individual life and corporate-owned life insurance, reinsurance pools and management operations, and other miscellaneous product lines. The majority of these products have been reinsured, with approximately 80 percent of reserves at December 31, 2020 ceded to other insurance companies.\nCorporate Segment\nOur Corporate segment includes investment income on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, interest expense on corporate debt other than non-recourse debt, and certain other corporate income and expenses not allocated to a line of business.\nReinsurance\nIn the normal course of business, we assume reinsurance from and cede reinsurance to other insurance companies. In a reinsurance transaction, a reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium or fee. We undertake reinsurance transactions for both risk management and capital management. If the assuming reinsurer in a reinsurance agreement is unable to meet its obligations, we remain contingently liable. In the event that reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, reinsurance recoverable balances could become uncollectible. We evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers to whom we cede business and monitor concentration of credit risk to minimize our exposure. We may also require assets to be held in trust, letters of credit, or other acceptable collateral to support reinsurance recoverable balances. The collectibility of our reinsurance recoverable is primarily a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers. Although we have controls to minimize our exposure, the insolvency of a reinsurer or the inability or unwillingness of a reinsurer to comply with the terms of a reinsurance contract could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn general, the maximum amount of life insurance risk retained by our U.S. insurance subsidiaries under group or individual life or group or individual accidental death and dismemberment policies during 2020 was $1 million per covered life per policy. The retention amount remains at $1 million for 2021. For Unum Limited life insurance risk, during 2020 we had reinsurance agreements which provided 75 percent quota share coverage up to \u00a3500 thousand per covered life for group dependent life benefits and 25 percent quota share coverage for most of our group lump sum benefits, as well as 100 percent coverage per covered life above that amount. In April 2020, we increased the quota share coverage for group lump sum benefits with one of our reinsurers to 75 percent, which resulted in an aggregate quota share coverage for our lump sum benefits of approximately 36 percent. The same structures, including the increased aggregate group lump sum quota share, will be maintained for coverage during 2021 for Unum Limited.\nIn December 2020, Provident, Paul Revere Life, and Unum America, collectively referred to as \"the ceding companies\", entered into a series of agreements (collectively referred to as the \"reinsurance agreement\") with Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company (Commonwealth) a subsidiary of Global Atlantic Financial Group, to reinsure on a coinsurance basis effective as of July 1, 2020 approximately 75 percent of the Closed Block individual disability insurance business, primarily direct business written by the ceding companies. Commonwealth has established and will maintain collateralized trust accounts for the benefit of the ceding companies to secure its obligations under the reinsurance agreement. As part of the reinsurance agreement, additional Closed Block individual disability business consisting of direct business not ceded in December 2020 and business assumed by the ceding companies from third parties, is expected to be reinsured in the first quarter of 2021, subject to receipt of required consents and regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions and is considered the second phase of this transaction.\nAlso in December 2020, prior to entering into this reinsurance agreement with Commonwealth, the ceding companies recaptured their respective reinsurance agreements with Northwind Reinsurance Company (Northwind Re) where substantially all of the ceding companies' Closed Block individual disability business had previously been fully ceded to Northwind Re. Northwind Re is an affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiary domiciled in the United States, with Unum Group as the ultimate parent.\nIn December 2020, Provident Life and Casualty Insurance Company (PLC), also a wholly-owned domestic insurance subsidiary of Unum Group, entered into an agreement with Commonwealth whereby PLC will provide a 12-year volatility cover to Commonwealth for the active life cohort (ALR cohort), which represents approximately five percent of the reserves ceded to Commonwealth. PLC will provide similar coverage to Commonwealth related to additional business ceded as part of the second phase of the transaction. At the end of the 12-year coverage period, Commonwealth will retain the risk for the remaining incidence and claims risk on the ALR cohort of the ceded business. Under this volatility cover, annual settlements will be made equal to the difference between the actual and estimated cash flows and reserve changes during the year. Upon expiration of the 12-year period, a terminal settlement will be made based on the final disabled life reserves. Due to the nature of the volatility cover, the ALR cohort will be accounted for under the deposit method on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis.\nWe have global catastrophic reinsurance coverage which covers all Unum Group insurance companies and includes four layers of coverage to limit our exposure under life, accidental death and dismemberment, long-term care, and disability policies in regard to a catastrophic event. Each layer provides coverage for all catastrophic events, including acts of war and any type of terrorism, up to $1 million of coverage per person per policy for each U.S. and non-U.K. line of covered business, and up to \u00a32 million of coverage for each U.K. covered line of business. We have the following coverage for 2021, after a $100 million deductible:\nIn addition to the global catastrophic reinsurance coverage noted above, Unum Limited has additional catastrophic coverage via an arms-length, inter-company reinsurance agreement with Unum America, under similar terms as the global catastrophic treaties. Unum Limited has additional coverage after a \u00a375 million deductible for 2021 of \u00a39 million or 12 percent.\nUnum Poland has additional global catastrophic reinsurance coverage of up to z\u014270 million with a maximum retention limit of z\u01420.8 million in 2020. Insurable events include passive war, as well as nuclear, chemical, biological and other forms of terrorism. This agreement was renewed with the same conditions for 2021.\nEvents may occur which limit or eliminate the availability of catastrophic reinsurance coverage in future years.\nWe have a quota share reinsurance agreement under which we cede certain blocks of Unum US group long-term disability claims. The agreement is on a combination coinsurance with funds withheld and modified coinsurance basis and provides 90 percent quota share reinsurance on the ceded claims. We also have five reinsurance agreements that collectively cede approximately 65 percent of Unum US group life risk up to our per person retention limit for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. These reinsurance agreements for Unum US group disability and group life allow us to more effectively manage capital in conformity with statutory accounting principles but do not meet insurance risk transfer in accordance with applicable GAAP and therefore are not accounted for as reinsurance in our consolidated GAAP financial statements.\nWe also cede 30 percent of the risk for certain blocks of recently issued Unum US individual disability policies, as well as some related claims development risk for a limited period of time. The agreement is on a non-proportional modified coinsurance basis with a provision for experience refunds.\nUnum America cedes certain blocks of business to Fairwind Insurance Company (Fairwind), which is an affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiary (captive reinsurer) domiciled in the United States, with Unum Group as the ultimate parent. This captive reinsurer was established for the limited purpose of reinsuring risks attributable to specified policies issued or reinsured by Unum America in order to effectively manage risks in connection with these blocks of our business as well as to enhance our capital efficiency. On a consolidated reporting basis for Unum Group, financial statement impacts of our reinsurance arrangements with affiliates are eliminated in accordance with GAAP.\nFor further discussion of our reinsurance activities, refer to \"Risk Factors\" contained herein in Item 1A; \"Executive Summary,\" \"Consolidated Operating Results,\" \"Segment Results,\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Available from Subsidiaries\" contained herein in Item 7, and Notes 1, 12, and 16 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8.\nReserves for Policy and Contract Benefits\nThe applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report, as liabilities, policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies. These reserves are the amounts which, with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature. These laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates, and methods of valuation required for statutory accounting.\nThe reserves reported in our financial statements contained herein are calculated in conformity with GAAP and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and reported in the statutory financial statements of our life insurance subsidiaries. These differences result from the use of mortality and morbidity tables and interest assumptions which we believe are more representative of the expected experience for these policies than those required for statutory accounting purposes and also result from differences in actuarial reserving methods.\nThe assumptions we use to calculate our reserves are intended to represent an estimate of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. If actual experience is equal, or favorable, to our reserve assumptions, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If experience is less favorable than the reserve assumptions, additional reserves may be required. The key experience assumptions include claim incidence rates, claim resolution rates, mortality and morbidity rates, policy persistency, interest rates, premium rate increases, and any applicable policy benefit offsets, including those for social security and other government-based welfare benefits. We periodically review our experience and update our policy reserves for new issues and reserves for all claims incurred, as we believe appropriate.\nThe consolidated statements of income include the annual change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits. The change reflects a normal accretion for premium payments and interest buildup and decreases for policy terminations such as lapses, deaths, and benefit payments. If policy reserves using best estimate assumptions as of the date of a test for loss recognition are higher than existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition costs, the increase in reserves necessary to recognize the deficiency is also included in the change in reserves for future policy and contract benefits.\nFor further discussion of reserves, refer to \"Risk Factors\" contained herein in Item 1A, \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" and the discussion of segment operating results included in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" contained herein in Item 7, and Notes 1 and 6 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8.\nInvestments\nInvestment activities are an integral part of our business, and profitability is significantly affected by investment results. We segment our invested assets into portfolios that support our various product lines. Generally, our investment strategy for our portfolios is to manage the effective asset cash flows and durations with related expected liability cash flows and durations to consistently meet the liability funding requirements of our businesses. We seek to earn investment income while assuming credit risk in a prudent and selective manner, subject to constraints of quality, liquidity, diversification, and regulatory considerations. Our overall investment philosophy is to invest in a portfolio of high quality assets that provide investment returns consistent with that assumed in the pricing of our insurance products. Assets are invested predominately in fixed maturity securities. Changes in interest rates may affect the amount and timing of cash flows.\nWe manage our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to manage interest rate risk. We may redistribute investments among our different lines of business, when necessary, to adjust the cash flow and/or duration of the asset portfolios to better match the cash flow and duration of the liability portfolios. Asset and liability portfolio modeling is updated on a quarterly basis and is used as part of the overall interest rate risk management strategy. Cash flows from the in-force asset and liability portfolios are projected at current interest rate levels and at levels reflecting an increase and a decrease in interest rates to obtain a range of projected cash flows under the different interest rate scenarios. These results enable us to assess the impact of projected changes in cash flows and duration resulting from potential changes in interest rates. Testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios enables us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy, as well as to limit the risk of disadvantageous outcomes. Although we test the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios as part of our modeling, the majority of our liabilities related to insurance contracts are not interest rate sensitive, and we therefore have minimal exposure to policy withdrawal risk. Our determination of investment strategy relies on long-term measures such as reserve adequacy analysis and the relationship between the portfolio yields supporting our various product lines and the aggregate discount rate assumptions embedded in the\nreserves. We also use this analysis in determining hedging strategies and utilizing derivative financial instruments for managing interest rate risk and the risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nRefer to \"Risk Factors\" contained herein in Item 1A; \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" and the discussion of investments in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" contained herein in Item 7; \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" herein in Item 7A; and Notes 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for information on our investments and derivative financial instruments.\nRatings\nAM Best, Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) are among the third parties that assign issuer credit ratings to Unum Group and financial strength ratings to our insurance subsidiaries. Issuer credit ratings reflect an agency's opinion of the overall financial capacity of a company to meet its senior debt obligations. Financial strength ratings are specific to each individual insurance subsidiary and reflect each rating agency's view of the overall financial strength (capital levels, earnings, growth, investments, business mix, operating performance, and market position) of the insuring entity and its ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. Both the issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings incorporate quantitative and qualitative analyses by rating agencies and are routinely reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis.\nRating agencies assign an outlook statement of \"positive,\" \"negative,\" or \"developing\" to indicate an intermediate-term trend in credit fundamentals which could lead to a rating change. \"Positive\" means that a rating may be raised, \"negative\" means that a rating may be lowered, and \"developing\" means that a rating may be raised or lowered with equal probability. Alternatively, a rating may have a \"stable\" outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change.\n\"Credit watch\" or \"under review\" highlights the potential direction of a short-term or long-term rating. It focuses on identifiable events and short-term trends that cause a rating to be placed under heightened surveillance by a rating agency. Events that may trigger this action include mergers, acquisitions, recapitalizations, regulatory actions, criteria changes, or operating developments. Ratings may be placed on credit watch or under review when an event or a change in an expected trend occurs and additional information is needed to evaluate the current rating level. This status does not mean that a rating change is inevitable, and ratings may change without first being placed on a watch list. A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nSee \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Ratings\" contained herein in Item 7 for our current outlook, issuer credit, and financial strength ratings.

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOverview\nWe face a wide range of risks, and our continued success depends on our ability to identify and appropriately manage our risk exposures. Discussed below are factors that may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Any one or more of the following factors may cause our actual results for various financial reporting periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company, including those in this document or made by us elsewhere, such as in earnings release investor calls, investor conference presentations, or press releases. See \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" contained herein on page 1.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting certain aspects of our business and, depending on severity and duration beyond current experience, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, and overall business operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to the global economy and has resulted in unfavorable impacts to our company as well as the overall insurance industry. Due to the unprecedented nature of these events and the current pace of change in this environment, we cannot fully estimate the duration or ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at this time. Further events that we are unable to control, such as the further spread, changes in mortality levels, or spikes in the number of cases of COVID-19 or the emergence of new strains of coronavirus, and the related responses by government authorities and businesses, may heighten the impacts of COVID-19 and present additional risks. We are closely monitoring several key risks related to our business that may potentially have adverse impacts on our business and operations.\nWe may experience significant lapse activity related to both our group and individual customers due to a rise in unemployment levels, the deterioration of economic conditions, and the general uncertainty regarding the financial situation of our customers. This may put strain on our liquidity and capital position and may also result in a decline in both premium income and persistency, particularly if customers do not ultimately return following a lapse. Further, adverse economic conditions may adversely affect the discretionary spending of current or potential customers, which may result in lower sales or other negative changes to customer purchasing patterns.\nDepending on the duration and severity of the current economic uncertainty, we may experience an increase in COVID-19-related deaths which could result in higher mortality within our life product lines. In addition, we may experience higher claim rates in our short-term disability products and higher expenses related to our leave management services.\nIn response to the disruptive economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve has taken actions to reduce interest rates, and the potential for a sustained low interest rate environment is magnified by the effects of COVID-19 on economic conditions. Further declines in interest rates or the continuance of low interest rates may place substantial pressure on our profit margins as well as on the discount rates used to calculate our insurance liabilities. Furthermore, the current economic conditions may result in the inability for companies to make interest and principal payments on their debt securities or mortgage loans that we hold for investment purposes. Accordingly, although we maintain a disciplined approach regarding our overall investment strategy, we may still incur significant losses that can result in a decline in net investment income and/or material increases in credit losses on our investment portfolio. With respect to commercial real estate, there could be potential impacts to estimates of expected losses resulting from lower underlying values, reflecting current market conditions at that time.\nIf we experience unfavorable developments related to our revenues, benefits, or expenses as described above, we may correspondingly experience adverse impacts to our overall future profitability and growth, which may alter the timing and magnitude of our plans for overall business expansion. In addition, these unfavorable developments may result in the write-off or impairment of intangible/long-lived assets such as deferred acquisition costs (DAC), value of business acquired, and goodwill, or the establishment of a valuation allowance regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets.\nAlthough we have access to significant amounts of liquidity, which include credit facilities, FHLB arrangements, and the ability to liquidate certain investments, it may be insufficient or even inaccessible if we are not in compliance with required covenants\nunder our borrowing arrangements or if the associated lenders are unable to provide funds. In addition, if investment markets become illiquid or severely impaired, we may be unable to liquidate our investments in a timely and advantageous manner.\nFrom an operational perspective, our employees, sales associates, brokers and distribution partners, as well as the workforces of our vendors, service providers and counterparties, may also be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or efforts to mitigate the pandemic, including government-mandated shutdowns, requests or orders for employees to work remotely, and other social distancing measures. The social distancing measures could result in an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business, including our ability to sell our policies, including policies that are traditionally sold in person, and our ability to adjudicate and pay claims in a timely manner. Additionally, the vast majority of our employees are currently working remotely and have been doing so for an extended length of time. This working environment is unprecedented and may expose us to various additional risks such as elevated cyber-security vulnerability resulting from the wide-scale remote usage of our company networks and risks to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nSee \"Executive Summary\", \"Segment Operating Results\", and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" included herein in Part 2, Item 7 under \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for additional discussion.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, and overall business operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks disclosed herein this Item 1A \"Risk Factors\".\nMarket and Credit Risks\nSustained periods of low interest rates in the long-term investment market may adversely affect our reported net investment income and the discount rates used in reserving for our insurance products and projecting our pension obligations, which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nDeclines in interest rates and/or the continuance of the current level of low interest rates and yields on fixed income investments may cause the rates of return on our investment portfolio to decrease more than expected, leading to lower net investment income than assumed in the pricing and reserving for our insurance products. An interest, or discount, rate is used in calculating reserves for our insurance products. We set our GAAP reserve discount rate assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield for assets supporting the reserves, considering current and expected future market conditions. If the discount rate assumed in our reserve calculations is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments. In that case, the reserves may eventually be insufficient, resulting in the need to increase our reserves and/or contribute additional capital to our insurance subsidiaries, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Similarly, we are required to perform annual adequacy testing, that considers multiple interest rate scenarios, to ensure our statutory reserves continue to meet statutory requirements, which could also require us to increase to our statutory reserves and/or contribute additional capital.\nOur net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for our pension plans are determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience. Major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected discount (interest) rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. We set the discount rate assumption at the measurement date for each of our plans to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixed income corporate debt instruments matched against the timing and amounts of projected future benefits. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases our costs. Our expectations for the future investment returns on plan assets are based on a combination of historical market performance, current market conditions, and future capital market assumptions obtained from external consultants and economists. The actual rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the fair value of the plan assets at the beginning and end of the measurement period. Increases or decreases in long-term interest rates as well as equity market volatility will impact the fair value of our plan assets and may result in a decrease in the funded status of our pension plans and/or increased pension costs, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nUnfavorable economic or market conditions may result in lower sales, lower premium growth and persistency, higher claims incidence, unfavorable mortality, and longer claims duration, which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are affected by conditions in the capital markets and the general economy, primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, and to a lesser extent, the broader global financial markets. Negative developments in the capital markets and/or the general economy could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn particular, factors such as unemployment levels, consumer confidence levels, consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, inflation, pandemics, and the threat of terrorism all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of our businesses. Given the nature of our products, in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment, lower personal income, reduced consumer spending, and lower corporate earnings and investment, new product sales may be adversely affected. Our premium growth may also be negatively impacted by lower premium growth from existing customers due to lower salary growth and lower growth in the number of employees covered under an existing policy. In addition, during such periods we may experience higher claims incidence, longer claims duration, and/or an increase in policy lapses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition to interest rate risk as previously discussed, we are exposed to other risks related to our investment portfolio which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nDefault Risk\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed maturity securities. These securities are issued by both domestic and foreign entities and are backed either by collateral or the credit of the underlying issuer. Factors such as an economic downturn or political change in the country of the issuer, a regulatory change pertaining to the issuer's industry, a significant deterioration in the cash flows of the issuer, unforeseen accounting irregularities or fraud committed by the issuer, widening risk spreads, ratings downgrades, a change in the issuer's marketplace or business prospects, or other events that adversely affect the issuers of these securities may result in the issuer defaulting on its obligations.\nOur mortgage loan portfolio has default risk. Events or developments, such as economic conditions that impact the ability of tenants to pay their rents or limit the availability of refinancing, may have a negative effect on our mortgage loan portfolio. Events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector may have a greater adverse effect on an investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated in that region or sector.\nA default results in the recognition of an impairment loss on the investment. A default may also adversely affect our ability to collect principal and interest due to us. The probability of credit downgrades and defaults increases when the fixed income markets experience periods of volatility and illiquidity.\nCredit Spread Risk\nOur exposure to credit spreads, which is the yield above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads. A widening of credit spreads may unfavorably impact the net unrealized gain or loss position of the investment portfolio and may adversely impact liquidity. Credit spread tightening may reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed income securities.\nValuation Risk\nWe report our fixed maturity securities and certain other financial instruments at fair value. Valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation, particularly during periods of market disruption, resulting in values which may be less than the value at which the investments may ultimately be sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported in our financial statements, and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe evaluate our investment portfolio for credit losses. There can be no assurance that we have accurately assessed the level of credit losses taken. Additional credit losses may need to be taken in the future, and historical trends may not be indicative of future credit losses. Any event reducing the value of our securities may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nMarket Timing and Liquidity Risk\nWhile we attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business, there may at times be a lack of appropriate investments in the market which can be\nacquired. In particular, due to the long duration of our long-term care product, the timing of our investment cash flows do not match those of our maturing liabilities. In addition, we may, in certain circumstances, need to sell investments due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements, changes in tax laws, rating agency decisions, and/or unexpected changes in liquidity needs. There may also be a limited market for certain of our investments, such as our private placement fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans, and policy loans, which makes them more illiquid. In periods of market volatility or disruption, other of our securities may also experience reduced liquidity. If events occur wherein we need to sell securities in an unfavorable interest rate or credit environment or need to quickly sell securities which are illiquid, market prices may be lower than what we might realize under normal circumstances, with a resulting adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nReinsurance may not be available or affordable, or reinsurers may be unwilling or unable to meet their obligations under our reinsurance contracts, which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nAs part of our overall risk management and capital management strategies, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various businesses. We also utilize reinsurance to exit certain lines of business. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of reinsurance. Any decrease in the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and may impact the level of capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries, and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will, absent a decrease in the amount of reinsurance, reduce our results of operations. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which may adversely affect our ability to write future business, result in the assumption of more risk with respect to the policies we issue, and increase our capital requirements. The collectibility of our reinsurance recoverable is primarily a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers. We cannot provide assurance that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis. The insolvency of a reinsurer or the inability or unwillingness of a reinsurer to comply with the terms of a reinsurance contract may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe effectiveness and utilization of our hedging programs may be affected by changes in the economic environment, changes in interest rates, capital market volatility, non-performance by our counterparties, changes in the level of required collateral, or regulation, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nWe use derivative financial instruments to help us manage certain risks related to our business operations, primarily foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, and risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities. Factors associated with derivative financial instruments could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Ineffectiveness of our hedges due to changes in expected future events, such as the risk created by uncertainty in the economic environment or if our counterparties fail or refuse to honor their obligations under these derivative instruments, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Capital market turmoil may result in an increase in the risk of non-performance by our counterparties, many of which are financial institutions. Non-performance by our counterparties may force us to unwind hedges, and we may be unable to replace the hedge, thereby leaving the risk unhedged. Under the terms of our hedging contracts, we are required to post collateral and to maintain a certain level of collateral, which may adversely affect our liquidity and could subject us to the credit risk of the counterparty to the extent it holds such collateral. Changes in regulations may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute hedging strategies due to the increased economic cost of derivatives, primarily as a result of more restrictive collateral requirements.\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) transition\nWe are continuing to monitor the developments surrounding the transition from LIBOR. We have evaluated our existing financial arrangements which primarily include investments, derivatives, and debt agreements and also have evaluated our insurance and reinsurance contracts and have determined that we will not be impacted significantly from this transition. In those circumstances where we do have financial or other contracts that are impacted by the LIBOR transition, we are appropriately modifying those contracts to reference a suitable alternative rate or are comfortable with the existing fallback language in those contracts.\nCurrency translation could materially impact our reported operating results.\nThe functional currency of our U.K. and Polish operations is the British pound sterling and the Polish zloty, respectively. Fluctuations in exchange rates have an effect on our reported financial results, which may be unfavorably impacted when the functional currency weakens. However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert our functional currency into dollars. As a result, we\nview foreign currency translation as a financial reporting item and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the U.K or Poland.\nSee \"Reserves for Policy and Contract Benefits\" contained herein in Item 1, \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" included in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" contained herein in Item 7, \"Interest Rate Risk\" contained herein in Item 7A, and Notes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.\nInsurance Risks\nActual experience may differ from our reserve assumptions which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nHistorical results may not be indicative of future performance due to, among other things, changes in our mix of business, re-pricing of certain lines of business, or any number of economic cyclical effects on our business. Reserves, whether calculated under GAAP or statutory accounting principles, do not represent an exact calculation of future benefit liabilities but are instead estimates made by us using actuarial and statistical procedures. Actual experience may differ from our reserve assumptions. There can be no assurance that our reserves will be sufficient to fund our future liabilities in all circumstances. Future loss development may require reserves to be increased, which would adversely affect earnings in current and future periods. Life expectancies may continue to increase, which could lengthen the time a claimant receives disability or long-term care benefits and could result in a change in mortality assumptions and an increase in reserves for these and other long-tailed products. Adjustments to reserve amounts may also be required in the event of changes from the assumptions regarding future morbidity (which represents the incidence of claims and the rate of recovery, including the effects thereon of inflation and other societal and economic factors); premium rate increases; persistency; policy benefit offsets, including those for social security and other government-based welfare benefits; and interest rates used in calculating the reserve amounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe provide a broad array of disability, long-term care, group life, and voluntary insurance products that are affected by many factors, and changes in any of those factors may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nDisability Insurance\nDisability insurance may be affected by a number of social, economic, governmental, competitive, and other factors. Changes in societal attitudes, such as work ethic, motivation, or stability, can significantly affect the demand for and underwriting results from disability products.\nBoth economic and societal factors can affect claim incidence and recoveries for disability insurance. Claim incidence and claim recovery rates may be influenced by, among other factors, the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence. Claim incidence and claim recovery rates may also be influenced by the emergence of new infectious diseases or illnesses. Claim durations may be extended by medical improvements which could extend life expectancies. The relationship between these and other factors and overall incidence is very complex and will vary due to contract design features and the degree of expertise within the insuring organization to price, underwrite, and adjudicate the claims.\nWithin the group disability market, pricing and renewal actions can be taken to react to higher claim rates. However, these actions take time to implement, and there is a risk that the market will not sustain increased prices. In addition, changes in economic and external conditions may not manifest themselves in claims experience for an extended period of time. The pricing actions available in the individual disability market differ among product classes. Our individual noncancelable disability policies, in which the policy is guaranteed to be renewable through the life of the policy at a fixed premium, do not permit us to adjust premiums on our in-force business. Guaranteed renewable contracts that are not noncancelable can be re-priced to reflect adverse experience, but rate changes cannot be implemented as quickly as in the group disability market.\nLong-term Care Insurance\nLong-term care insurance can be affected by a number of demographic, medical, economic, governmental, competitive, and other factors. Because long-term care insurance is a relatively new product for the insurance industry and is long-duration in nature, there is not as much historical data as is available for our other products, especially at advanced ages. This creates a level of uncertainty in properly pricing the product and using appropriate assumptions when establishing reserves. Long-term\ncare insurance is guaranteed renewable and can be re-priced to reflect adverse experience, but the re-pricing is subject to regulatory approval by our states of domicile and may also be subject to approval by jurisdictions in which our policyholders reside. The rate approval process can affect the length of time in which the re-pricing can be implemented, if at all, and the rate increases ultimately approved may be unfavorable relative to assumptions used to establish our reserves. We monitor our own experience and industry studies concerning morbidity, mortality, and policyholder terminations to understand emerging trends. Changes in actual experience relative to our expectations may adversely affect our profitability and reserves. To the extent mortality improves for the general population, and life expectancies increase, the period for which a claimant receives long-term care benefits may lengthen and the associated impact of advanced aging of policyholders may cause an increase in claims incidence. Medical advances may continue to have an impact on claim incidence and duration, both favorable and unfavorable. Due to the long duration of the product, the timing and/or amount of our investment cash flows are difficult to match to those of our maturing liabilities. Sustained periods of low or declining interest rates could result in increases in reserves and adversely affect our results of operations.\nGroup Life Insurance\nGroup life insurance may be affected by the characteristics of the employees insured, the amount of insurance employees may elect voluntarily, our risk selection process, our ability to retain employer groups with favorable risk characteristics, the geographical concentration of employees, and mortality rates. Claim incidence may also be influenced by unexpected catastrophic events such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and pandemic health events, which may also affect the cost of and availability of reinsurance coverage.\nVoluntary Products\nVoluntary products sold in the workplace may be affected by the characteristics of the employees insured, the level of employee participation and the amount of insurance the employees elect, our risk selection process, and our ability to retain employer groups with favorable risk characteristics. A portion of our voluntary life insurance products include interest sensitive forms of insurance which contain a guaranteed minimum interest crediting rate. It is possible that our investment returns could be lower than the guaranteed crediting rate. While a significant portion of our non-life contracts are optionally renewable, some are guaranteed renewable and can be repriced to reflect adverse experience, but rate changes cannot be implemented as quickly as for group disability and group life products.\nWe have assets which may not be fully recoverable or realizable, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nIf our business does not perform well or as initially anticipated in our assumptions, we may be required to accelerate amortization or recognize an impairment loss on intangible assets or long-lived assets or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset.\nWe have intangible assets such as DAC, value of business acquired (VOBA), and goodwill. DAC and VOBA are amortized based primarily upon expected future premium income of the related insurance policies. Recoverability testing for DAC and VOBA is performed on an annual basis. Insurance contracts are grouped on a basis consistent with our manner of acquiring, servicing, and measuring profitability of the contracts. If recoverability testing indicates that either DAC and/or VOBA are not recoverable, the deficiency is charged to expense.\nGoodwill is not amortized, but on an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary, we review the carrying amount of goodwill for indications of impairment, considering in that review the financial performance and other relevant factors. In accordance with accounting guidance, we test for impairment at either the operating segment level or one level below. In addition, certain events including, but not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business environment, an adverse action by a regulator or rating agency, or unanticipated competition would cause us to review goodwill for impairment more frequently than annually.\nLong-lived assets, including assets such as real estate and information technology software, also may require impairment testing to determine whether changes in circumstances indicate that we may be unable to recover the carrying amount.\nWe assess our deferred tax assets to determine if they are realizable. Factors in our determination include the performance of the business, including the ability to generate future taxable income. If based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding charge to net income.\nCharges such as accelerated amortization, impairment losses, or the establishment of valuation allowances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nSee \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" included in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" contained herein in Item 7, and Note 13 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.\nOperational Risks\nA cyber attack or other security breach could disrupt our operations, result in the unauthorized disclosure or loss of confidential data, damage our reputation or relationships, and expose us to significant financial and legal liability, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe store confidential information about our business and our policyholders, employees, agents and others on our information technology systems, including proprietary and personally identifiable information. As part of our normal business operations, we use this information and engage third-party providers, including outsourcing, cloud computing, and other business partners, that store, access, process, and transmit such information on our behalf. We devote significant resources and employ security measures to help protect our information technology systems and confidential information, and we have programs in place to detect, contain, and respond to information security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we and our third-party providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties or through open source solutions may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise our information security. Unauthorized parties, whether within or outside our company, may disrupt or gain access to our systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through human error, misfeasance, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceit, including break-ins, use of stolen credentials, social engineering, phishing, or other cyber attacks, computer viruses, malicious codes, and similar means of unauthorized and destructive tampering.\nWe and our third-party providers have experienced and likely will continue to experience information security incidents from time to time. Although known incidents have not had a material effect on our business or financial condition, there is no assurance that our security systems and measures will be able to prevent, mitigate, or remediate future incidents that could have such an effect. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our information technology systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, could cause serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations, unauthorized disclosure or loss of confidential information, harm to our brand or reputation, loss of customers and revenues, violations of privacy and other laws, and exposure to litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement proceedings, fines, and potentially criminal proceedings and penalties. If we are unaware of the incident for some time after it occurs, our exposure could increase. In addition, the costs to address or remediate systems disruptions or security threats or vulnerabilities, whether before or after an incident, could be significant. As we continue to build our digital capabilities and focus on enhancing the customer experience, the amount of information that we retain and share with third parties, as well as our reliance on them, is likely to grow, increasing the cost to prevent data security breaches and the cost and potential consequences of such breaches. An information technology systems failure could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators. Further, successful cyber-attacks at other large financial institutions or other market participants, whether or not we are affected, could lead to a general loss of customer and investor confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us.\nAlthough we have insurance against some cyber risks and attacks, we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our policy limits, are subject to deductibles or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies.\nThe failure of our business recovery and incident management processes to resume our business operations in the event of a natural catastrophe, cyber attack, or other event could adversely affect our profitability, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIn the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an epidemic/pandemic, a cyber attack, cyber security breach or other information technology systems failure, a terrorist attack, or war, unanticipated problems with our disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those problems affect our information technology systems and destroy valuable data or result in a significant failure of our internal control environment. In addition, in the event that a significant number of our employees were unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised.\nThe failure of our information technology and/or disaster recovery processes or systems for any reason could cause significant interruptions or malfunctions in our or our customers\u2019 operations and result in the loss, theft, or failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to our customers. Such a failure could harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions, legal claims, and increased expenses, and lead to a loss of customers and revenues.\nOur failure to develop digital capabilities or to effectively execute upgrades to or replacements of information technology systems could impair our ability to deliver on our growth initiatives or administer our business, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur business plans increasingly rely on digital capabilities to meet or surpass customer expectations, simplify our operations, and deliver innovative product and service offerings. If we are unable to effectively develop and offer digital capabilities that enhance our customers' experience, we may not fully achieve our strategic growth initiatives and may also experience the loss of existing business. Although we believe we have information technology systems which adequately support our business needs, we continually upgrade our existing information technology systems and acquire or develop new systems to keep pace with the rapidly changing business and technology environment. There are risks involved with upgrading or replacing information technology systems, including, but not limited to, data loss, data errors, and disruption to our operations. We seek to monitor and control our exposure to the risks arising out of these activities through our risk control framework which encompasses a variety of reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes, and other mechanisms.\nUnum Group depends on funds from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends. The ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to Unum Group may be impaired by adverse financial results or a change in capital requirements. Accordingly, internal sources of capital and liquidity may not always be sufficient. If we need to seek external capital, adverse market conditions may affect our access to capital or our cost of capital.\nUnum Group is a holding company for insurance and other subsidiaries and has limited operations of its own. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to insurance laws and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and on other transfers of funds or other assets to affiliates, including to Unum Group. The level of earnings and capital in our subsidiaries, as well as business conditions and rating agency considerations, could impact our insurance and other subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or to make other transfers of funds to Unum Group, which could impair our ability to pay dividends to Unum Group's common stockholders, meet our debt and other payment obligations, and/or repurchase shares of Unum Group's common stock. The use of funds held by Unum Group as consideration in any acquisition could affect our capital plan and render those funds unavailable for other corporate purposes.\nA change in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations. Deterioration in the credit market, which could delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner, could also negatively impact our cash flows. Regulatory changes such as those discussed herein in this Item 1A may impose higher capital or reserve requirements on our insurance subsidiaries, increase collateral requirements for certain of our derivatives transactions, and/or implement other requirements which could unfavorably affect our liquidity. Without sufficient liquidity, our ability to maintain and grow our operations would be limited. If our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may be unable to successfully obtain additional financing and capital on favorable terms, or at all, which may adversely affect us.\nIf our financial results are unfavorable, we may need to increase our capital in order to maintain our credit ratings or satisfy regulatory requirements. Maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus is considered important not only by us but by insurance regulatory authorities in the U.S., the PRA in the U.K., the KNF in Poland, and the rating agencies that rate insurers' claims-paying abilities and financial strength. Failure to maintain certain levels of statutory surplus could result in increased\nregulatory scrutiny, action by regulatory authorities, or a downgrade by the rating agencies. Need for additional capital may limit a subsidiary's ability to distribute funds to our holding companies.\nObtaining financing for even a small amount of capital could be challenging in unfavorable market conditions and during periods of economic uncertainty. The markets may exert downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers. The availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, and the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. Raising capital in unfavorable market conditions could increase our interest expense or negatively impact our shareholders through increased dilution of their common stock in Unum Group.\nWe rely on our credit facilities as a potential source of liquidity. Our right to borrow funds under these facilities is subject to financial covenants, negative covenants, and events of default. Our ability to borrow under these facilities are also subject to the continued willingness and ability of the lenders to provide funds. Our failure to comply with the covenants in the credit facilities or the failure of lenders to fund their lending commitments would restrict our ability to access these facilities when needed, with a resulting adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nSee \"Regulation\" contained herein in Item 1,\"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" included in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" contained herein in Item 7, and Notes 8 and 16 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.\nOur risk management program may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our business.\nWe have devoted significant resources to develop our enterprise risk management program, which has the objective of managing our strategic, market, credit, insurance, and operations risks, which ultimately impact our reputational risk. However, our program may not be comprehensive, and our methods for monitoring and managing risk may not fully predict or mitigate future exposures. In this case, there may be a negative impact to our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nSee \"Regulation\" contained herein Item 1, \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" included in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" contained herein in Item 7 and Notes 1, 7 and 14 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for additional information on legal proceedings.\nSee \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" contained herein in Item 7A for further information about our risk management program.\nGeneral Risks\nWe and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation. Changes in laws and regulations that affect our industry or findings from examinations and investigations may affect the cost or demand for our products, increase capital and reserving requirements for our insurance subsidiaries, and adversely affect our profitability, liquidity, or growth.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the United States and abroad. The primary purpose of insurance regulation is to protect policyholders, not stockholders. To that end, applicable laws establish regulatory authorities, including state insurance departments in the United States, the PRA in the United Kingdom, and the KNF in Poland, with broad administrative powers over many aspects of the insurance business. For example, our insurance subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary licenses, permits, authorizations, or accreditations, or may be able to do so only at great cost. In addition, we and our insurance subsidiaries may not be able to comply fully with, or obtain appropriate exemptions from, the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and insurance holding companies. These laws and regulations can be complex and subject to differing interpretations and are regularly re-examined. Existing or future laws and regulations, and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. For example, they may restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us, restrict transactions between subsidiaries and/or between us and our subsidiaries, and may require contributions of capital by us to our insurance subsidiaries even if we are otherwise in compliance with stated requirements. Failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate exemptions under any applicable laws or regulations could result in restrictions on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which they operate and could result in fines and other sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nRegulatory examinations or investigations could result in, among other things, an increase to reserving requirements, changes in our claims handling or other business practices, changes in procedures for the identification and payment to the states of benefits and other property that is not claimed by the owners, changes in the use and oversight of reinsurance, changes in governance and other oversight procedures, assessments by tax authorities or other governing agencies, fines, and other administrative action, which could injure our reputation, adversely affect our issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings, place us at a competitive disadvantage in marketing or administering our products, impair our ability to sell or retain insurance policies, and/or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nIt is possible that there will be heightened oversight of insurers by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled and operate. We cannot predict specific proposals that might be adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could have on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. For instance, the NAIC or state regulators may adopt further revisions to statutory reserving standards or the RBC formula, the PRA may revise its capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins, the IAIS may adopt capital requirements to which we could be subject, or rating agencies may incorporate higher capital thresholds into their quantitative analyses, thus requiring additional capital contributions by us to our insurance subsidiaries. Increased financial services regulation, which could include activities undertaken by the NAIC and regulatory authorities in the U.K., Poland, and the EU may impose greater quantitative requirements, supervisory review, and disclosure requirements and may impact the business strategies, capital requirements, and profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. The United Kingdom's Financial Ombudsman Service, which was established to help settle disputes between consumers and businesses providing financial services, and the FCA, which has rule-making, investigative, and enforcement powers to protect consumers, may hamper our ability to do business, which could have a material adverse effect on our U.K. operations.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles, in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies within these countries, which may also be influenced by the International Accounting Standards Board. Future accounting standards we adopt, including the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board's accounting standard update related to long-duration targeted improvements for insurance contracts, will change current accounting and disclosure requirements applicable to our financial statements. Such changes may have a material effect on our reported results of operations or financial condition and may also impact the perception of our business by external stakeholders.\nWe use an affiliated captive reinsurer for the limited purpose of reinsuring risks attributable to specified policies issued or reinsured by one of our insurance subsidiaries in order to effectively manage risks in connection with certain blocks of our business as well as to enhance our capital efficiency. If we were required to discontinue use of the captive reinsurer or to alter the structure of the captive reinsurance arrangement, our ability to maintain current RBC ratios and/or our capital deployment activities could be adversely affected.\nChanges in U.S. programs such as healthcare reform, the emergence of paid family and medical leave legislation, and financial services sector reform may compete with or diminish the need or demand for our products, particularly as it may affect our ability to sell our products through employers or in the workplace. The U.S. social security disability insurance program may not be sustainable, which may adversely affect the level of our disability claim payments and reserves. Legislative changes related to pension funding requirements could negatively impact our cash flows from operations and our profitability.\nChanges in tax laws and other regulations or interpretations of such laws or regulations could unfavorably impact our corporate taxes. In addition, changes in tax laws could make some of our products less attractive to consumers.\nOn January 31, 2020, an official bill was passed formalizing the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union (EU). A deal was reached on December 24, 2020 on the future trading relationship with the EU. The deal focused primarily on the trading of goods rather than the U.K.\u2019s service sector, which will be subject to further negotiations in 2021 and will focus on financial services and future regulation. In addition, the U.K. government is reviewing the regulatory framework of financial services companies which may result in changes to U.K. regulatory capital or U.K. tax regulations. We do not expect that the underlying operations of our U.K. business, nor the Polish business which is in the EU, will be significantly impacted by the withdrawal but we may see some continued dampening of growth in the U.K. as well as earnings volatility due to the current disruption and uncertainty in the U.K. economy. We may also experience volatility in the fair values of our investments in U.K. and EU-based issuers, but we do not expect a material increase in credit losses or defaults, nor do we believe this volatility will impact our ability to hold these investments. In addition, the current economic conditions may also cause volatility in our\nsolvency ratios. Our reported consolidated financial results continue to be impacted by fluctuations in the British pound sterling to dollar exchange rate.\nMost group long-term and short-term disability plans we administer are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Changes to ERISA enacted by Congress or through judicial interpretations may adversely affect the risk to us of managing employee benefit plans, increase the premiums associated with such plans, and ultimately affect their affordability and our profitability.\nThe insurance departments in jurisdictions wherein our insurance subsidiaries conduct business may limit our ability to obtain rate increases under guaranteed renewable contracts or could require changes in rates and/or benefits to meet minimum loss ratio requirements which could negatively impact the profitability of our products. Many regulatory and governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents and employees. These regulatory or governmental bodies may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices are improper. These actions could result in substantial fines or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Determination by regulatory authorities that we have engaged in improper conduct may also adversely affect our defense of various lawsuits.\nA decrease in our financial strength or issuer credit ratings may adversely affect our competitive position, our ability to hedge our risks, and our cost of capital or ability to raise capital, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nWe compete based in part on the financial strength ratings provided by rating agencies. A downgrade of our financial strength ratings may adversely affect us and could potentially, among other things, adversely affect our relationships with distributors of our products and services and retention of our sales force, negatively impact persistency and new sales, and generally adversely affect our ability to compete. A downgrade in the issuer credit rating assigned to Unum Group can be expected to adversely affect our cost of capital and our ability to raise additional capital. If we are downgraded significantly, ratings triggers in our derivatives financial instrument contracts may result in our counterparties enforcing their option to terminate the derivative contracts. Such an event may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our ability to hedge our risks.\nCompetition may adversely affect our market share or profitability.\nAll of our businesses are highly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our business are price, the quality of our customer's experience regarding service and claims management, integrated product choices, enrollment capabilities, financial strength, and claims-paying ratings. We compete for new product sales, the retention of existing business, and the ability to attract and retain independent agents and brokers to market our products, all of which affect our profitability. All areas of the employee benefits markets are highly competitive due to the yearly renewable term nature of the group products and the large number of insurance companies offering products in this market. There is a risk that our customers may be able to obtain more favorable terms or improved technology solutions from competitors in lieu of renewing coverage with us, particularly if industry pricing levels do not align with our view of adequate premium rates. We are operating in a dynamic competitive environment of both traditional and non-traditional competitors, with changes in product offerings, enrollment capabilities, and technology solutions. The level and intensity of competition may also grow due to existing competitors becoming more aggressive, and an increase in merger and acquisition activity which may result in larger competitors with greater financial resources. There are many insurance companies which actively compete with us in our lines of business, and there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against these companies and new competitors in the future.\nEvents that damage our reputation may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThere are many events which may harm our reputation, including, but not limited to, those discussed in this Item 1A regarding regulatory investigations, legal proceedings, social issues, and cyber or other information security incidents.\nIn addition, being in the business of insurance, we are paid to accept certain risks. Those who conduct business on our behalf, including executive officers and members of management, sales managers, investment professionals, and to some extent, independent agents and brokers, do so in part by making decisions that involve exposing us to risk. These include decisions such as maintaining effective underwriting and pricing discipline, maintaining effective claim management and customer service performance, managing our investment portfolio and derivatives trading activities, delivering effective technology solutions, complying with established sales practices, executing our capital management strategy, exiting a line of business and/or pursuing strategic growth initiatives, and other decisions. Although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor\nbusiness decisions and prevent us from taking excessive risks or unintentionally failing to comply with internal policies and practices such that errors occur, there can be no assurance that these controls and procedures will be effective. If our employees and business associates take excessive risks and/or fail to comply with internal policies and practices, the impact of those events may damage our market position and reputation.\nDepending on the severity of the damage to our reputation, we may be unable to effectively compete for new products or retain our existing business, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Damage to our reputation may also hinder our ability to raise new capital and/or increase our cost of capital.\nLitigation and contingencies are common in our businesses and may result in financial losses and/or harm to our reputation.\nWe are, and in the future may be, defendants in a number of litigation matters, and the outcome of this litigation is uncertain. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages. An estimated loss is accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An adverse outcome in one or more of these actions may, depending on the nature, scope and amount of the ruling, materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition, encourage other litigation, and limit our ability to write new business, particularly if the adverse outcomes negatively impact certain of our ratings.\nAs part of our normal operations in managing claims, we are engaged in claim litigation where disputes arise as a result of a denial or termination of benefits. Typically those lawsuits are filed on behalf of a single claimant or policyholder, and in some of these individual actions punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims. For our general claim litigation, we maintain reserves based on experience to satisfy judgments and settlements in the normal course. We expect that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to general claim litigation, after consideration of the reserves maintained, will not be material to our financial condition. Nevertheless, given the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain claim litigation involving punitive damages may, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible punitive losses.\nSee \"Reserves for Policy and Contract Benefits\", \"Competition\", \"Regulation\" and \"Ratings\" contained herein in Item 1, \"Executive Summary\" and \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" included in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" contained herein in Item 7, and Notes 1, 6, 7, and 14 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussion and analysis presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" included below the Table of Contents, \"Risk Factors\" included herein Item 1A, \"Selected Financial Data\" included herein this Item 6, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Item 8.\nExecutive Summary\n2020 Operating Performance and Capital Management\nFor 2020, we reported net income of $793.0 million, or $3.89 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $1,100.3 million, or $5.24 per diluted common share, in 2019. Included in our results for 2020 are: (i) the impact from the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance agreement, which resulted in a net loss of $5.8 million before tax and a net gain of $32.0 million after tax, or $0.16 per diluted common share, (ii) a reserve increase related to our long-term care block of business of $151.5 million before tax and $119.7 million after tax, or $0.59 per diluted common share, (iii) a reserve increase related to our group pension block of business of $17.5 million before tax and $13.8 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted common share, (iv) costs related to an organizational design update in the amount of $23.3 million before tax and $18.6 million after tax, or $0.09 per diluted common share, (v) an impairment loss on the right-of-use (ROU) asset related to one of our operating leases of $12.7 million before tax and $10.0 million after tax, or $0.05 per diluted common share, and (vi) a net realized investment loss, excluding the net realized investment gain related to the reinsurance transaction, of $103.2 million before tax and $82.3 million after tax, or $0.40 per diluted common share. Included in our 2019 results are costs related to the early retirement of debt of $27.3 million before tax and $21.6 million after tax, or $0.11 per diluted common share and a net realized investment loss of $23.2 million before tax and $18.7 million after tax, or $0.09 per diluted common share. Adjusting for these items, after-tax adjusted operating income for 2020 was $1,005.4 million, or $4.93 per diluted common share compared to $1,140.6 million, or $5.44 per diluted common share for 2019. See \"Closed Block Individual Disability Reinsurance Agreement,\" \"Long-term Care Reserve Increase,\" \"Group Pension Reserve Increase,\" \"Costs Related to Organizational Design Update,\" \"Impairment Loss on ROU Asset,\" \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures,\" and \"Consolidated Operating Results\" contained herein in this Item 7 for further discussion and a reconciliation of these items.\nOur Unum US segment reported a decrease in adjusted operating income of 19.9 percent in 2020 compared to 2019, due to unfavorable benefits experience, particularly in the group life product line, and higher operating expenses. The benefit ratio for our Unum US segment for 2020 was 68.8 percent, compared to 66.9 percent in 2019. Unum US sales decreased 10.0 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. Overall persistency was lower relative to the prior year period.\nOur Unum International segment reported a decrease in adjusted operating income of 29.0 percent in 2020 compared to 2019, as measured in U.S. dollars. Our Unum UK line of business reported a decrease in adjusted operating income of 32.3 percent compared to 2019, as measured in local currency, due primarily to unfavorable benefits experience and lower net investment income, partially offset by an increase in premium income. The benefit ratio for our Unum UK line of business was 78.9 percent in 2020 compared to 76.7 percent in 2019. Unum International sales, as measured in U.S. dollars, decreased 9.5 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. Unum UK sales, as measured in local currency, decreased 10.8 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. Overall persistency was lower relative to the prior year period.\nOur Colonial Life segment reported a decrease in adjusted operating income of 2.6 percent in 2020 compared to 2019 due to unfavorable benefits experience, partially offset by premium growth, higher net investment income, and lower operating expenses. The 2020 benefit ratio for Colonial Life was 52.9 percent, compared to 51.3 percent in 2019. Colonial Life sales decreased 27.0 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. Overall persistency was higher relative to the prior year period.\nOur Closed Block segment reported a loss before income tax and net realized investment gains and losses of $1,235.7 million, which includes the impacts related to the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance agreement and the reserve increases related to our long-term care and group pension blocks of business. Excluding these items, our Closed Block segment reported adjusted operating income of $241.4 million in 2020 compared to $137.7 million in 2019. The long-term care interest adjusted loss ratio for 2020 was favorable relative to our range of expectations. The individual disability interest adjusted loss ratio, excluding the reserve recognition impact from the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance agreement, was unfavorable in 2020 compared to 2019 but generally remained within our expectations.\nOur net investment income yields continue to be pressured by the low interest rate environment as we maintain consistent credit quality in our invested asset portfolio. The net unrealized gain on our fixed maturity securities was $7.6 billion at December 31,\n2020, compared to $6.4 billion at December 31, 2019, with the increase due primarily to a decline in U.S. Treasury rates. The earned book yield on our investment portfolio was 4.75 percent for 2020 compared to a yield of 5.00 percent for 2019.\nWe believe our capital and financial positions are strong. At December 31, 2020, the RBC ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, calculated on a weighted average basis using the NAIC Company Action Level formula, was approximately 365 percent, which is in line with our expectations. We did not repurchase shares during 2020. Our weighted average common shares outstanding, assuming dilution, equaled 203.8 million for 2020 compared to 209.9 million for 2019. As of December 31, 2020, Unum Group and our intermediate holding companies had available holding company liquidity of $1,512 million that was held primarily in fixed maturity securities, short-term investments, and cash.\nClosed Block Individual Disability Reinsurance Agreement\nIn December 2020, Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company, The Paul Revere Life Insurance Company, and Unum Life Insurance Company of America, wholly-owned domestic insurance subsidiaries of Unum Group and collectively referred to as \"the ceding companies\", entered into a series of agreements (collectively referred to as the \"reinsurance agreement\") with Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company (Commonwealth), a subsidiary of Global Atlantic Financial Group, to reinsure on a coinsurance basis effective as of July 1, 2020, approximately 75 percent of the Closed Block individual disability insurance business, primarily direct business written by the ceding companies. Commonwealth has established and will maintain collateralized trust accounts for the benefit of the ceding companies to secure its obligations under the reinsurance agreement. As part of the agreement, additional Closed Block individual disability business consisting of direct business not ceded in December 2020 and business assumed by the ceding companies from third parties, is expected to be reinsured in the first quarter of 2021, subject to receipt of required consents and regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions and is considered the second phase of this transaction.\nIn December 2020, Provident Life and Casualty Insurance Company (PLC), also a wholly-owned domestic insurance subsidiary of Unum Group, entered into an agreement with Commonwealth whereby PLC will provide a 12-year volatility cover to Commonwealth for the active life cohort (ALR cohort), which represents approximately five percent of the reserves ceded to Commonwealth. As part of this agreement, PLC received a payment from Commonwealth of approximately $62 million. PLC will provide similar coverage to Commonwealth related to the additional business that will be ceded as part of the second phase of the transaction. At the end of the 12-year coverage period, Commonwealth will retain the remaining incidence and claims risk on the ALR cohort of the ceded business.\nIn connection with the first phase of the coinsurance agreement that closed in December 2020, the ceding companies paid a total cash ceding commission to Commonwealth of approximately $438 million and transferred additional assets consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities and cash totaling $6,669.8 million. As a result of this reinsurance agreement, we recognized the following in the fourth quarter of 2020:\n\u2022Net realized investment gains totaling $1,302.3 million, or $1,028.8 million after tax, related to the transfer of investments.\n\u2022Increase in benefits and change in reserves for future benefits of $1,284.5 million, or $1,014.7 million after tax, resulting from the realization of previously unrealized investment gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.\n\u2022Transaction costs totaling $21.0 million, or $16.6 million after tax.\n\u2022Tax benefit of $36.5 million.\n\u2022Reinsurance recoverable of $6,141.5 million related to the policies on claim status (DLR cohort).\n\u2022Cost of reinsurance, or prepaid reinsurance premium, of $815.7 million related to the DLR cohort, of which we recognized amortization expense of $2.6 million, or $2.0 million after tax, subsequent to the closing of the transaction.\n\u2022Deposit asset of $88.2 million related to the ALR cohort.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we released approximately $400 million of capital as a result of the reinsurance transaction and we expect to release approximately $250 million of additional capital in the first quarter of 2021 assuming the second phase of the transaction is fully executed, subject to receipt of required consents and regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions. See \"Reinsurance\" contained herein in Item 1; \"Segment Results,\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Available from Subsidiaries\" contained herein in Item 7, and Notes 12 and 16 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion on the impacts related to this reinsurance agreement.\n2020 Long-term Care Reserve Increase\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed a review of policy reserve adequacy, which incorporated our most recent experience and included a review of all material assumptions. Based on our analysis, during the fourth quarter of 2020, we updated our reserve assumptions and determined that our gross policy and claim reserves should be increased by $151.5 million to reflect our current estimate of future benefit obligations. This increase was primarily driven by an update to our interest rate assumption, partially offset by favorable premium rate increase approvals and inventory updates. See \"Trends in Key Assumptions\" contained herein in the \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" of this Item 7 for further discussion of the assumptions used in our long-term care reserve update.\n2020 Group Pension Reserve Increase\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed our annual review of policy reserve adequacy, which incorporated our most recent experience and included a review of all assumptions. Based on our analysis, during the fourth quarter of 2020, we updated our reserve assumptions and determined that our policy and claim reserves should be increased by $17.5 million to reflect our updated discount rate assumptions.\nCosts Related to Organizational Design Update\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, we realigned certain parts of our organizational structure by shifting resources to accelerate growth, fund priority investments, and simplify and improve our business practices. In connection with this update, we incurred charges of $23.3 million, which primarily consisted of employee severance and benefit costs as well as costs related to lease terminations and the disposal of certain fixed assets. This update did not result in the exit or disposal of any of our lines of business and we do not expect material additional costs associated with this update in the future.\nImpairment Loss on ROU Asset\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we recognized an impairment loss of $12.7 million on the ROU asset related to one of our operating leases for office space that we do not plan to continue using to support our general operations. The impairment loss was recorded as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the ROU asset compared to its carrying value.\nU.K. Tax Law Change\nOn July 22, 2020, the Finance Bill 2019-21 was enacted, resulting in a U.K. tax rate increase from 17 percent to 19 percent, retroactively effective April 1, 2020, which resulted in tax expense of $9.3 million for the revaluation of our tax assets and liabilities.\nU.K. Referendum\nOn January 31, 2020, an official bill was passed formalizing the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union (EU). A deal was reached on December 24, 2020 on the future trading relationship with the EU. The deal focused primarily on the trading of goods rather than the U.K.\u2019s service sector, which will be subject to further negotiations in 2021 and will focus on financial services and future regulation. In addition, the U.K. government is reviewing the regulatory framework of financial services companies which may result in changes to U.K. regulatory capital or U.K. tax regulations. We do not expect that the underlying operations of our U.K. business, nor the Polish business which is in the EU, will be significantly impacted by the withdrawal, but we may see some continued dampening of growth in the U.K. as well as earnings volatility due to the current disruption and uncertainty in the U.K. economy. We may also experience volatility in the fair values of our investments in U.K. and EU-based issuers, but we do not expect a material increase in impairments or defaults, nor do we believe this volatility will impact our ability to hold these investments. In addition, the current economic conditions may also cause volatility in our solvency ratios. Our reported consolidated financial results may continue to be impacted by fluctuations in the British pound sterling to dollar exchange rate. See \"Regulation\" contained herein in Item 1, \"Risk Factors\" contained herein Item 1A, and \"Unum International Segment\" contained herein this Item 7.\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization identified the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic. COVID-19 has caused significant disruption to the global economy and has unfavorably impacted our company as well as the overall insurance industry. Due to the unprecedented nature of these events and the current pace of change in this environment, we cannot fully estimate the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at this time. We are closely monitoring several key factors related to our business that have and may continue to have adverse impacts.\nResults of Operations\nBenefits Experience\nWe have identified activity in certain of our products that is inconsistent with historical experience that is due to COVID-19 and the related environment. In particular, we have experienced higher mortality in our life product lines, higher claim incidence in certain of our disability product lines, and lower claim resolutions in our Unum UK group long-term disability product line due to disruptions in our claims processes. Conversely, we experienced lower claims utilization in our dental and vision products, particularly in the second quarter of 2020, resulting from the impact of stay-at-home orders and general quarantine measures. With respect to our long-term care product line, we have experienced higher claimant mortality and lower submitted incidence.\nWe continue to monitor the benefits experience across all of our products for trends potentially correlated with COVID-19. For further discussion regarding the benefits experience for each of our operating business segments, see \"Segment Results\" herein in this Item 7.\nNet Investment Income\nDuring 2020, we have experienced a decline in our net investment income as a result of the current economic conditions. The current economic conditions have sustained the low interest rate environment, which has and will continue to impact the yield on our invested assets, particularly related to the investment of new cash flows. The net asset values of our partnership investments continued to improve in the fourth quarter of 2020 from the depressed values experienced earlier in the year reflecting the improved market conditions of the third quarter of 2020 and resulted in overall positive earnings in 2020 for our partnership investments although lower than the level of earnings we experienced in 2019. We have also worked with certain of our commercial mortgage loan borrowers that have requested temporary payment deferrals but these instances have not resulted in a significant number of loans with deferrals or a significant impact on our net investment income. For further information on our investment portfolio, see \"Investments\" contained herein in this Item 7 and Notes 2 and 3 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8.\nPremium Income and Premium Receivable Collectability\nWe have experienced a disruption in sales activity related to certain of our product lines due to some potential new customers deferring their purchasing decisions given the current economic environment and challenges in our ability to meet with potential new customers for policies that are traditionally sold in person mitigated somewhat by our investment in digital tools and capabilities. If we continue to experience this disruption, our premium income may decline. In addition, in certain of our product lines, we are also experiencing a decline in the number of lives insured by our customers as they navigate the current environment. Although we have not experienced a material decline in the collectability of premiums due from our customers, we have increased the allowance for credit losses on our premium receivable balances to consider higher unemployment levels and the general uncertainty regarding the financial condition of our customers. We continue to work with our customers to understand their respective financial conditions and develop solutions on a case-by-case basis to allow for additional payment flexibility to enhance the likelihood of premium collection and avoid disruptions in coverage. However, circumstances may deteriorate quickly which could result in the decline of persistency levels and sales growth in the near term, and potentially longer if the current situation persists, which may materially impact our results of operations through continued increases in our allowances for credit losses and lower premium income.\nSee Note 1 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further information on our allowances for credit losses.\nFinancial Condition\nInvestments\nRegarding our fixed maturity security portfolio, the current economic conditions have increased volatility in the capital markets and have caused significant pressure on the profitability of many companies. The sharp decline in oil prices experienced earlier in the year and decrease in demand due to COVID-19, which began in the first quarter of 2020, also caused pressure on the profitability of companies in the energy sector. We recorded credit losses during the first quarter of 2020 primarily related to fixed maturity securities issued by companies in the energy sector, but recorded minimal credit losses related to energy securities in the remainder of 2020 primarily as a result of the improvement in oil prices. Our exposure to consumer cyclicals which have been stressed due to COVID-19 related shutdowns is a small portion of our portfolio and our exposure to other stressed industries such as airlines and restaurants is minimal. We continue to monitor capital market activity on a regular basis and to the extent that there are continued volatility and ratings downgrades related to the issuers of our fixed maturity securities, we could experience further credit losses, an increase in defaults, and the need for additional capital in our insurance subsidiaries. However, we remain confident in the overall strength and credit quality of our investment portfolio.\nOther\nIf we continue to experience unfavorable trends in the above areas of focus, we may also experience certain additional, correlated impacts such as an increase in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs if we have a decline in persistency. We may also be required to write-off or impair certain intangible/long-lived assets such as value of business acquired and goodwill if we experience declines in the overall profitability of our businesses. Furthermore, if the profitability of our businesses declines, we may also be required to establish a valuation allowance regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have strengthened our liquidity position through actions such as maintaining a higher level of short-term investments and posting additional collateral from certain of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries to the regional Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB). As a result, we believe we have the appropriate liquidity and access to capital to avoid significant disruption to our operations. We have not yet experienced a significant impact to our liquidity as a result of the collection of premiums and submitted claims activity; however, we continually monitor the developments of these items.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have borrowed $312.2 million of funds through our memberships with the regional FHLBs and those funds are used for the purpose of investing in either short-term investments or fixed maturity securities. Although we did increase FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2020, we have additional borrowing capacity of approximately $1,093 million that can be utilized for liquidity if the need arises. Additionally, we have access to two unsecured revolving credit facilities under separate syndicates of lenders that allow us to borrow up to a total of $600 million. There are currently no outstanding borrowings on these facilities but we remain in compliance with required covenants should we choose to borrow in the future. In May 2020, we issued $500.0 million of 4.500% senior notes due 2025 which strengthened our liquidity and demonstrated our ability to raise capital in a strained economic environment.\nFollowing the maturity of our $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% unsecured notes in the third quarter of 2020, which was funded through an issuance of debt during the second quarter of 2019, we have no significant upcoming debt maturities until 2024. We continue to meet the financial covenants contained in our current debt agreements and credit facilities, and we expect that we will continue to meet those covenants in subsequent periods.\nTo the extent that we begin to experience a significant impact to our liquidity, we would likely sell highly liquid invested assets or borrow funds on our credit facilities to meet operational cash flow requirements.\nBusiness Operations\nOther than disruption to sales processes in certain of our product lines, we have not experienced a significant disruption to our operational processes as we have been able to successfully implement our business continuation plans to accommodate remote work arrangements for the safety of our employees and customers. We also have not experienced significant disruption to our financial reporting systems or internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures as a result of COVID-19. We have implemented travel restrictions for the safety of our employees and customers, but do not expect those restrictions to significantly disrupt our operations.\n2018 Long-term Care Reserve Increase\nPolicy reserves for our long-term care block of business are determined using the gross premium valuation method and, prior to the third quarter of 2018, were valued based on assumptions established as of December 31, 2014, the date of our last assumption update under loss recognition. Gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient. We undertake a review of policy reserve adequacy annually during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the review.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we completed our annual review of policy reserve adequacy, which incorporated our most recent experience and included a review of all assumptions. The review utilized internal and external data and outside consulting firms for quality assurance and industry benchmarking. Based on our analysis, during the third quarter of 2018, we updated our reserve assumptions and determined that our policy and claim reserves should be increased by $750.8 million, or $593.1 million after-tax, to reflect our current estimate of future benefit obligations. This increase was primarily driven by the update to our liability and interest rate assumptions, particularly claims incidence and claim termination rates, which resulted in an increase to reserves of approximately $2.2 billion. Partially offsetting the increase was the update to our assumptions for premium rate increases which decreased reserves approximately $1.4 billion, resulting in the net increase to reserves of $750.8 million.\n2018 Acquisitions of Business\nIn November 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the shares and voting interests in Jaimini Health, Inc. (Jaimini Health), a dental health maintenance organization. The acquisition of Jaimini Health will broaden our employee benefit dental offerings in the U.S., particularly in the state of California and is reported in our Unum US segment.\nIn October 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the shares and voting interests in Pramerica Zycie TUiR S.A. (which we have subsequently renamed Unum Zycie TUiR S.A. and refer to as Unum Poland), a financial protection benefits provider in Poland. This acquisition will expand our European presence, which we believe to be an attractive market for financial protection benefits.\nIn January 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the shares and voting interests in Leavelogic, Inc (Leavelogic), a leave management technology provider. The acquisition of Leavelogic will enhance our current leave management offerings by providing tools for employers and employees to better manage the family leave process and is reported in our Unum US segment.\nSee Note 13 of the \" Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d contained herein in Item 8 for further details.\nConsolidated Company Outlook for 2021\nWe believe our disciplined approach to providing financial protection products at the workplace puts us in a position of strength. The products and services we provide have never been more important to employers, employees and their families, especially given the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to fulfill our corporate purpose of helping the working world thrive throughout life\u2019s moments by providing excellent service to people at their time of need. Our strategy remains centered on growing our core businesses through investing and transforming our operations and technology to anticipate and respond to the changing needs of our customers, expand into new adjacent markets through meaningful partnerships and effective deployment of our capital across our portfolio.\nIn consideration of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, in the near term, we expect top line growth to be challenging, and we may also continue to experience increased claims volatility. The low interest rate environment continues to place pressure on our profit margins by impacting net investment income yields as well as potentially discount rates on our insurance liabilities. We would also expect to experience further investment volatility through net investment income, particularly for partnership net asset value changes. As part of our continued pricing discipline and our reserving methodology, we continuously monitor emerging interest rate experience and adjust our pricing and reserve discount rates, as appropriate.\nOur business is well-diversified by geography, industry exposures and case size, and we continue to analyze and employ strategies that we believe will help us navigate the current environment. These strategies allow us to maintain financial flexibility to support the needs of our businesses, while also returning capital to our shareholders. We have strong core businesses that have a track record of generating significant capital, and we will continue to invest in our operations and expand into adjacent markets where we can best leverage our expertise and capabilities to capture market growth opportunities as those opportunities re-emerge. Long-term, we believe that consistent operating results, combined with the implementation of strategic initiatives and the effective deployment of capital, will allow us to meet our financial objectives.\nFurther discussion is included in \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,\" \"Consolidated Operating Results,\" \"Segment Results,\" \"Investments,\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" contained herein in this Item 7 and in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\nWe analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measure of \"after-tax adjusted operating income\" differs from net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and income statements prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and amortization of the cost of reinsurance as well as certain other items as specified in the reconciliations below. We believe after-tax adjusted operating income is a better performance measure and better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business.\nRealized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments. Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses. Although we may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities.\nAs previously discussed, we have exited a substantial portion of our closed block individual disability product line through the reinsurance agreement that was executed in December 2020. As a result, we exclude the amortization of the cost of reinsurance that was recognized as a result of the exit of the business related to the DLR cohort of policies. We believe that the exclusion of the amortization of the cost of reinsurance provides a better view of our results from our ongoing businesses.\nWe may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability.\nSee \"Executive Summary\" contained herein in Item 7 and Notes 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, and 15 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion regarding the impacts of the 2018 and 2020 long-term care reserve increases, the group pension reserve increase, the total impacts of the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction, the amortization of the cost of reinsurance, costs related to the organizational design update, the impairment loss on the ROU asset related to one of our operating leases for office space, and the cost related to the early retirement of debt.\nA reconciliation of GAAP financial measures to our non-GAAP financial measures is as follows:\nWe measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of \"adjusted operating revenue\" and \"adjusted operating income\" or \"adjusted operating loss\", which differ from total revenue and income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and amortization of the cost of reinsurance as well as and certain other items as specified in the reconciliations below. These performance measures are in accordance with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for total revenue, income before income tax, or net income.\nA reconciliation of total revenue to \"adjusted operating revenue\" and income before income tax to \"adjusted operating income\" is as follows:\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our financial statements. The accounting estimates deemed to be most critical to our financial position and results of operations are those related to reserves for policy and contract benefits, deferred acquisition costs, valuation of investments, pension and postretirement benefit plans, income taxes, and contingent liabilities. For additional information, refer to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8.\nReserves for Policy and Contract Benefits\nReserves for policy and contract benefits are our largest liabilities and represent claims that we estimate we will eventually pay to our policyholders. The two primary categories of reserves are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us. Reserves for policy and contract benefits equaled $45.3 billion and $43.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, or approximately 75.8 percent and 76.6 percent of our total liabilities, respectively. Reserves ceded to reinsurers were $13.2 billion and $7.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019 and are reported as a reinsurance recoverable in our consolidated balance sheets.\nPolicy Reserves\nPolicy reserves are established in the same period we issue a policy and equal the difference between projected future policy benefits and future premiums, allowing a margin for expenses and profit. These reserves relate primarily to our non-interest sensitive products, including our individual disability and voluntary benefits products in our Unum US segment; individual disability and life products in our Unum International segment; disability and cancer and critical illness policies in our Colonial Life segment; and individual disability, long-term care, and other products in our Closed Block segment. The reserves are calculated based on assumptions that were appropriate at the date the policy was issued and are not subsequently modified unless the policy reserves become inadequate (i.e. loss recognition occurs).\n\u2022Persistency assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations.\n\u2022Claim incidence and claim resolution rate assumptions related to mortality and morbidity are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations.\n\u2022Discount rate assumptions are based on our current and expected net investment returns.\nIn establishing policy reserves, we use assumptions that reflect our best estimate while considering the potential for adverse variances in actual future experience, which results in a total policy reserve balance that has an embedded reserve for adverse deviation. We do not, however, establish an explicit and separate reserve as a provision for adverse deviation from our assumptions.\nWe perform loss recognition tests on our policy reserves annually, or more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test, without a provision for adverse deviation. We group the policy reserves for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests. If the policy reserves determined using these best estimate assumptions are higher than our existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition cost balance, the existing policy reserves are increased or deferred acquisition costs are reduced to immediately recognize the deficiency. Thereafter, the policy reserves for the product line are calculated using the same method we used for the loss recognition testing, referred to as the gross premium valuation method, wherein we use our best estimate as of the gross premium valuation (loss recognition) date rather than the initial policy issue date to determine the expected future claims, commissions, and expenses we will pay and the expected future gross premiums we will receive.\nBecause the key policy reserve assumptions for policy persistency, mortality and morbidity, and discount rates are all locked in at policy issuance based on assumptions appropriate at that time, policy reserve assumptions are generally not changed due to a change in claim status from active to disabled subsequent to policy issuance. Depending on the funding mechanism, a full policy reserve is held during disability reflecting continued funding of the full policy reserve during a disability claim, or a fractional policy reserve is held reflecting that the individual policyholder would need to recover before he or she can again generate future claims for a separate occurrence. The policy reserves build up and release over time based on assumptions made at the time of policy issuance such that the reserve is eliminated as policyholders either reach the terminal age for coverage, die, or voluntarily lapse the policy. Policy reserves for Unum US, Unum International, and Colonial Life products are determined using the net\nlevel premium method as prescribed by GAAP. In applying this method, we use, as applicable by product type, morbidity and mortality incidence rate assumptions, claim resolution rate assumptions, and policy persistency assumptions, among others, to determine our expected future claim payments and expected future premium income. We then apply an interest, or discount, rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims and claim expenses we will pay and the expected future premiums we will receive, with a provision for profit allowed.\nPolicy reserves for our Closed Block segment include certain older policy forms for individual disability, individual and group long-term care, and certain other products, all of which are no longer actively marketed. The reserves for individual disability and individual and group long-term care are determined using the gross premium valuation method. Key assumptions are persistency, mortality and morbidity, claim incidence, claim resolution rates, commission rates, and maintenance expense rates. For long-term care, premium rate increases are also a key assumption. We apply an interest, or discount, rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims, commissions, and expenses we will pay as well as the expected future premiums we will receive, with no provision for future profit. The interest rate is based on our expected net investment returns on the investment portfolio supporting the reserves for these blocks of business. Under the gross premium valuation method, we do not include an embedded provision for the risk of adverse deviation from these assumptions. Gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient in the future.\nPolicy reserves for certain other products, excluding individual disability and individual and group long-term care, which are no longer actively marketed and are reported in our Closed Block segment represent $5.7 billion on a gross basis. We have ceded $5.0 billion of reserves related to the other products, which are primarily comprised of policy reserves, to reinsurers. The ceded reserve balance is reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a reinsurance recoverable. We continue to service a block of group pension products, which we have not ceded, and the policy reserves for these products are based on expected mortality rates and retirement rates. Expected future payments are discounted at interest rates reflecting the anticipated investment returns for the assets supporting the liabilities.\nClaim Reserves\nClaim reserves are established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) to us and, as prescribed by GAAP, equals our long-term best estimate of the present value of the liability for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. A claim reserve is based on actual known facts regarding the claim, such as the benefits available under the applicable policy, the covered benefit period, the age, and, as appropriate, the occupation and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience for factors such as the claim duration, discount rate, and policy benefit offsets, including those for social security and other government-based welfare benefits. Reserves for IBNR claims, similar to incurred claim reserves, include our assumptions for claim duration and discount rates, but because we do not yet know the facts regarding the specific claims, these reserves are also established based on historical incidence rate assumptions, including claim reporting patterns, the average cost of claims, and the expected volumes of incurred claims. Our incurred claim reserves and IBNR claim reserves do not include any provision for the risk of adverse deviation from our assumptions.\nClaim reserves, unlike policy reserves, are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change. Each quarter we review our emerging experience to ensure that our claim reserves are appropriate. If we believe, based on our actual experience and our view of future events, that our long-term assumptions need to be modified, we adjust our reserves accordingly with a charge or credit to our current period income.\nMultiple estimation methods exist to establish claim reserve liabilities, with each method having its own advantages and disadvantages. Available reserving methods utilized to calculate claim reserves include the tabular reserve method, the paid loss development method, the incurred loss development method, the count and severity method, and the expected claim cost method. No single method is better than the others in all situations and for all product lines. The estimation methods we have chosen are those that we believe produce the most reliable reserves.\nWe use a tabular reserve methodology on reported claims for our Unum US group long-term disability and individual disability claims as well as for our Closed Block individual disability and group and individual long-term care claims. Under the tabular reserve methodology, reserves for reported claims are based on certain characteristics of the actual reported claimants, such as age, length of time disabled, and medical diagnosis, as well as assumptions regarding claim duration, discount rate, and policy benefit offsets. We believe the tabular reserve method is the most accurate to calculate long-term liabilities and allows us to use the most available known facts about each claim. IBNR claim reserves for our long-term products are calculated using the count and severity method using historical patterns of the claims to be reported and the associated claim costs. For Unum US group short-term disability products, an estimate of the value of future payments to be made on claims already submitted, as well as on\nIBNR claims, is determined in aggregate using a paid loss development method rather than on the individual claimant basis that we use for reported claims on long-term products. The average length of time between the event triggering a claim under a policy and the final resolution of those claims is much shorter for these products than for our long-term liabilities and results in less estimation variability.\nClaim reserves for Unum US group life and accidental death and dismemberment products are related primarily to death claims reported but not yet paid, IBNR death claims, and a liability for waiver of premium benefits. The death claim reserve is based on the actual face amount to be paid, the IBNR reserve is calculated using the paid loss development method, and the waiver of premium benefits reserve is calculated using the tabular reserve methodology.\nClaim reserves supporting the group and individual dental and vision products reported in our Unum US and Colonial Life segments have a short claim payout period. As a result, the reserves, which primarily represent IBNR and a small amount of claims pending payment, are calculated using the paid loss development method.\nClaim reserves supporting our Unum International segment are calculated using generally the same methodology that we use for Unum US disability and group term life reserves. Claim reserves for our Unum UK group dependent life product are calculated using discounted cash flows, based on our assumptions for claim duration and discount rates. The assumptions used in calculating claim reserves for this segment are based on standard country-specific industry experience, adjusted for our own experience.\nThe majority of the Colonial Life segment lines of business have short-term benefits, which generally have less estimation variability than our long-term products because of the shorter claim payout period. Our claim reserves for Colonial Life's lines of business are predominantly determined using the incurred loss development method based on our own experience. The incurred loss development method uses the historical patterns of payments by loss date to predict future claim payments for each loss date. Where the incurred loss development method may not be appropriate, we estimate the incurred claims using an expected claim cost per policy or other measure of exposure. The key assumptions for claim reserves for the Colonial Life segment lines of business are the timing, rate, and amount of estimated future claim payments; and the estimated expenses associated with the payment of claims.\nThe following table displays policy reserves, incurred claim reserves, and IBNR claim reserves by major product line, with the summation of the policy reserves and claim reserves shown both gross and net of the associated reinsurance recoverable. Incurred claim reserves represent the expected benefits payable under each incurred claim, along with other expenses associated with the payment of the claims. IBNR claim reserves include provisions for incurred but not reported claims and a provision for reopened claims for our disability products. The IBNR and reopened claim reserves for our disability products are developed and maintained in aggregate based on historical monitoring. Impacting year over year comparability of policy and claim reserves in the following chart are the 2020 long-term care and group pension reserve increases as well as the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction that we entered into in December 2020. See \"Executive Summary\" contained herein in this Item 7 and Notes 6 and 12 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.\nKey Assumptions\nThe calculation of policy and claim reserves involves numerous assumptions, but the primary assumptions used to calculate reserves are (1) the discount rate, (2) the claim resolution rate, and (3) the claim incidence rate for policy reserves and IBNR claim reserves. Of these assumptions, our discount rate and claim resolution rate assumptions have historically had the most significant effects on our level of reserves because many of our product lines provide benefit payments over an extended period of time.\n1.The discount rate, which is used in calculating both policy reserves and incurred and IBNR claim reserves, is the interest rate that we use to discount future claim payments to determine the present value. A higher discount rate produces a lower reserve. If the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments. In this case, the reserves may eventually be insufficient. We set our assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield of the assets supporting the reserves, considering current and expected future market conditions. If the investment yield on new investments that are purchased differs from the investment yield of the existing investment portfolio, the discount rate assumption on claims may be adjusted to reflect the impact of the new investment yield.\n2.The claim resolution rate, used for both policy reserves and incurred and IBNR claim reserves, is the probability that a disability or long-term care claim will close due to recovery or death of the insured. It is important because it is used to estimate how long benefits will be paid for a claim. Estimated resolution rates that are set too high will result in reserves that are lower than they need to be to pay the claim benefits over time. Claim resolution assumptions involve many factors, including the cause of disability, the policyholder's age, the type of contractual benefits provided, and the time since initial disability. We primarily use our own\nclaim experience to develop our claim resolution assumptions. These assumptions are established for the probability of death and the probability of recovery from disability. Our studies review actual claim resolution experience over a number of years, with more weight placed on our experience in the more recent years. We also consider any expected future changes in claim resolution experience.\n3.The incidence rate, used for policy reserves and IBNR claim reserves, is the rate at which new claims are submitted to us. The incidence rate is affected by many factors, including the age of the insured, the insured's occupation or industry, the benefit plan design, and certain external factors such as consumer confidence and levels of unemployment. We establish our incidence assumption using a historical review of actual incidence results along with an outlook of future incidence expectations.\nEstablishing reserve assumptions is complex and involves many factors. Reserves, particularly for policies offering insurance coverage for long-term disabilities and long-term care, are dependent on numerous assumptions other than just those presented in the preceding discussion. The impact of internal and external events, such as changes in claims operational procedures, economic trends such as the rate of unemployment and the level of consumer confidence, the emergence of new diseases, new trends and developments in medical treatments, and legal trends and legislative changes, including changes to social security and other government-based welfare benefits programs which provide policy benefit offsets, among other factors, will influence claim incidence rates, claim resolution rates, and claim costs. In addition, for policies offering coverage for disability or long-term care at advanced ages, the level and pattern of mortality rates at advanced ages will impact overall benefit costs. Reserve assumptions differ by product line and by policy type within a product line. Additionally, in any period and over time, our actual experience may have a positive or negative variance from our long-term assumptions, either singularly or collectively, and these variances may offset each other. We test the overall adequacy of our reserves using all assumptions and with a long-term view of our expected experience over the life of a block of business rather than test just one or a few assumptions independently that may be aberrant over a short period of time. Therefore, while it is possible to evaluate the sensitivity of overall adequacy results in our reserves based upon a change in each individual assumption, the actual impacts of changes to a variety of underlying assumptions must be considered in the aggregate by product line in order to judge the overall potential implications to reserve adequacy. The following section presents an overview of our trend analysis for key assumptions and the results of variability in our assumptions, in aggregate, for the reserves which we believe are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our future financial results if actual claims yield a materially different amount than what we currently expect and have reserved for, either favorable or unfavorable. In December 2020, we reinsured approximately 75 percent of our Closed Block individual disability business pursuant to a reinsurance agreement with Commonwealth and expect that we will complete the second phase of this transaction in the first quarter of 2021 to cede a significant portion of the remaining business. As a result, we are no longer incorporating this block of business into our discussion of trends in key assumptions below.\nTrends in Key Assumptions\nGenerally, we do not expect our mortality and morbidity claim incidence trends or our persistency trends to change significantly in the short-term, and to the extent that these trends do change, we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time. We have historically experienced an increase in our group long-term disability morbidity claim incidence trends during and following a recessionary period and believe claim incidence trends may continue to somewhat follow general economic conditions and demographics of the general workforce. Regarding the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, in the short-term we have experienced elevated mortality and anticipate continuation through part of 2021. However, at this time, our view on our long-term mortality and morbidity expectations has not been impacted by this limited experience.\nClaim incidence rates for Unum US group long-term disability were generally consistent in 2020 compared to the prior year.\nIn 2020, both short-term and long-term interest rates decreased. The long-term interest rates supporting the majority of our lines of business remain below historical norms. The assumptions we used to discount reserves during this period were slightly lower for certain of our product lines. Reserve discount rate assumptions for new policies and new claims are periodically adjusted to reflect our current and expected net investment returns. Changes in our average discount rate assumptions tend to occur gradually over a longer period of time because of the long-duration investment portfolios which support the reserves for the majority of our lines of business.\nOur claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period, both favorably and unfavorably. Claim resolution rates are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and have a greater chance of significant variability in a shorter period of time than our other reserve assumptions. These rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis for the death and recovery components separately. Claim resolution rates in our Unum US group long-term disability product line have\nexhibited some variability over the last several years. Relative to the resolution rate we expect to experience over the life of the block of business, actual quarterly rates during 2019 and 2020 have remained within 5 percent of our long-term assumptions in our Unum US group long-term disability line of business. Claim resolution rates for our group long-term disability product line have generally exhibited an increasing trend.\nWe monitor and test our reserves for adequacy relative to all of our assumptions in the aggregate. In our estimation, scenarios based on reasonably possible variations in each of our reserve assumptions for our Unum US group long-term disability product, when modeled together in aggregate, could produce a change in our reserve balance of $201 million based on a 3.3 percent variation, favorable or unfavorable, in our assumptions. The major contributor to the variance is the claim resolution rate.\nIn addition to our Unum US group long-term disability line of business, we consider variability in our reserve assumptions related to long-term care policy reserves. These reserves are held under the gross premium valuation method and do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient. As such, positive developments will result in the accumulation of reserve margin, while adverse developments would result in an additional reserve charge. Policy reserves for long-term care are based upon a number of key assumptions, and each assumption has various factors which may impact the long-term outcome. Key assumptions with respect to morbidity, mortality, claims incidence and resolutions, persistency, interest rates, and future premium rate increases must incorporate extended views of expectations for many years into the future. Reserves are highly sensitive to these estimates.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed a review of policy reserve adequacy, which incorporated our most recent experience and included a review of all material assumptions. Based on our analysis, during the fourth quarter of 2020, we updated our interest rate and premium rate increase reserve assumptions from those established at our prior loss recognition in the third quarter of 2018 and determined that our gross long-term care policy and claim reserves should be increased by $151.5 million.\nOur long-term care discount rate assumption reflects our expectation that the low interest rate environment will continue to persist and our expected impact on future long-term care new money yield rates. Our updated expectation for long-term care new money yield rates assumes a 10-year treasury rate grading over 7 years to a rate of 3.25 percent, when we assume no further increase. Partially offsetting the impact from the discount rate assumption was a favorable update to our assumptions for premium rate increases based on approvals and inventory updates since the third quarter of 2018. The remaining key assumptions for our long-term care policy reserves remain materially unchanged from the third quarter of 2018.\nSensitivity analysis related to our key assumptions for long-term care reserves along with the potential impact to our reserve balance is as follows. This sensitivity analysis was completed as of the date of our assumption update in the fourth quarter of 2020 and will not be updated unless reserves are again determined to be deficient in the future.\nKey assumptions and related impacts are also heavily interrelated in both their outcome and in their effects on reserves. For example, changes in the view of morbidity and mortality might be mitigated by either potential future premium rate increases and/or morbidity improvements due to general improvement in health and/or medical breakthroughs. There is potentially a wide range of outcomes for each assumption and in totality.\nWe believe that these ranges provide a reasonable estimate of the possible changes in reserve balances for those product lines where we believe it is possible that variability in the assumptions, in the aggregate, could result in a material impact on our reserve levels, but we record our reserves based on our long-term best estimate. Because these product lines have long-term claim payout periods, there is a greater potential for significant variability in claim costs, either positive or negative. We closely monitor emerging experience and use these results to inform our view of long-term assumptions.\nDeferred Acquisition Costs (DAC)\nWe defer incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts and amortize these costs over the life of the related policies. Deferred costs include certain commissions, other agency compensation, selection and policy issue expenses, and field expenses. Acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business, such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy, are excluded from deferral.\nApproximately 93.4 percent of our DAC relates to non-interest sensitive products, and we amortize DAC for these products in proportion to the premium income we expect to receive over the life of the policies. DAC related to interest sensitive policies is amortized over the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from surrender charges, mortality margins, investment returns, and expense margins. Key assumptions used in developing the future amortization of DAC are persistency, premium income, and for our interest sensitive products, mortality margins and investment returns. We use our own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of our businesses in determining our assumptions. For non-interest sensitive products, the estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is generally higher than in the later years due to the anticipated cumulative effect of policy persistency in the early years, which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy. Our key assumptions used to develop the future amortization of acquisition costs deferred during 2020 did not change materially from those used in 2019. Generally, we do not expect our key assumptions to change significantly in the short-term, and to the extent that these trends do change, we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time.\nThe following are our current assumptions regarding our DAC balances:\nAmortization of DAC is adjusted to reflect actual experience for assumptions which deviate compared to the anticipated experience. Any deviations from projections may result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period such events occur. As an example, for our non-interest sensitive products, we may experience accelerated amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected, or we may experience a slower rate of amortization if policies persist longer than projected. Our actual experience has not varied materially from our assumptions during the last three years.\nSee Note 1 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our DAC accounting policy.\nFair Value of Investments\nAll of our fixed maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, and all of our unrestricted equity securities are reported at fair value. Our derivative financial instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, are reported as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. We report our investments in private equity partnerships at our share of the partnerships' net asset value per share or its equivalent (NAV), as a practical expedient for fair value.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and therefore represents an exit price, not an entry price. The exit price objective applies regardless of our intent and/or ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date. We generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, and to a lesser extent, the income approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities and the income approach converts future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount, or a discounted amount. We believe the market approach valuation technique provides more observable data than the income approach, considering the types of investments we hold.\nThe degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value. The market sources from which we obtain or derive the fair values of our assets and liabilities carried at market value include quoted market prices for actual trades, price quotes from third party pricing vendors, price quotes we obtain from outside brokers, discounted cash flow, and observable prices for similar publicly traded or privately traded issues that incorporate the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer. Our fair value measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputs.\nInputs to valuation techniques refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities, including assumptions about risk, for example, the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value and/or the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. We use observable and unobservable inputs in measuring the fair value of our financial instruments. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nCertain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices and/or observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market liquidity. For these securities, we use internally prepared valuations, including valuations based on estimates of future profitability, to estimate the fair value. We consider key assumptions, such as risk-free interest rates and risk premium adjustments, in the valuation of these types of securities. Additionally, we may obtain prices from independent third-party brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities. Key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for these securities include risk-free interest rates, risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any), and other factors involving significant assumptions which may or may not reflect those of an active market.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 9.6 percent of our fixed maturity securities were categorized as Level 1, 87.6 percent as Level 2, and 2.8 percent as Level 3. Level 1 is the highest category of the three-level fair value hierarchy classification wherein inputs are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Level 2 category includes assets or liabilities valued using inputs (other than those included in the Level 1 category) that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument's anticipated life. The Level 3 category is the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date using unobservable inputs to extrapolate an estimated fair value.\nRapidly changing credit and equity market conditions can materially impact the valuation of securities, and the period to period changes in value can vary significantly.\nSee Note 2 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8.\nInvestment Credit Losses\nOne of the significant estimates related to investments is our credit loss valuation. In determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security represents a credit loss, we evaluate the following factors:\n\u2022Whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security\n\u2022Whether we intend to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis\n\u2022Whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments\n\u2022The significance of the decline in value\n\u2022Current and future business prospects and trends of earnings\n\u2022The valuation of the security\u2019s underlying collateral\n\u2022Relevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cycles\n\u2022Market conditions\n\u2022Rating agency and governmental actions\n\u2022Bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity\n\u2022Adverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investments\n\u2022Changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date\n\u2022Any other key measures for the related security\nWe evaluate available information, including the factors noted above, both positive and negative, in reaching our conclusions. In particular, we also consider the strength of the issuer\u2019s balance sheet, its debt obligations and near term funding requirements, cash flow and liquidity, the profitability of its core businesses, the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity, its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment, and its access to capital markets. Although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis, our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security, whether we intend to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether a credit loss is possible. The significance of the decline in value is also an important factor, but we generally do not record a credit loss based solely on this factor, since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a security.\nWhile determining whether a credit loss exists is a judgmental area, we utilize a formal, well-defined, and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio, supported by issuer specific research and documentation as of the end of each period. The process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and the recording of credit losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have credit loss.\nWe use a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of our mortgage loans and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation. We estimate an allowance for credit losses that we expect to incur over the life of our mortgage loans using a probability of default method. For each loan, we estimate the probability that the loan will default before its maturity (probability of default) and the amount of the loss if the loan defaults (loss given default). These two factors result in an expected loss percentage that is applied to the amortized cost of each loan to determine the expected credit loss. Mortgage loans are reported at amortized cost less the allowance for expected credit losses with the change in expected credit losses recognized as a realized investment loss in our consolidated statements of income.\nThere are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring our investments for credit losses and determining when and if a credit loss exists. These risks and uncertainties include the following possibilities:\n\u2022The assessment of a borrower's ability to meet its contractual obligations will change.\n\u2022The economic outlook, either domestic or foreign, may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated, and as such, the investment may not recover in value.\n\u2022New information may become available concerning the security, such as disclosure of accounting irregularities, fraud, or corporate governance issues.\n\u2022Significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industry.\n\u2022Significant increases in interest rates may occur and may not return to levels similar to when securities were initially purchased.\n\u2022Adverse rating agency actions may occur.\nSee Notes 1 and 3 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor several defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans for our employees, including non-qualified pension plans. The U.S. qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans comprise the majority of our total benefit obligation and benefit cost. We maintain a separate defined benefit plan for eligible employees in our U.K. operation. The U.S. defined benefit pension plans were closed to new entrants on December 31, 2013, the OPEB plan was closed to new entrants on December 31, 2012, and the U.K. plan was closed to new entrants on December 31, 2002.\nAssumptions\nOur net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for these plans are determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience. Major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected discount (interest) rate, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, and mortality rates. We also use, as applicable, expected increases in compensation levels and a weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits, which reflects a health care cost trend rate, and the U.K. pension plan also uses expected cost of living increases to plan benefits.\nThe assumptions chosen for our pension and OPEB plans are reviewed annually, using a December 31 measurement date for each of our plans unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement. The discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, and mortality rate assumptions have the most significant effect on our net periodic benefit costs associated with these plans. In addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions, the net periodic cost or benefit obligation under our pension and OPEB plans may change due to factors such as plan amendments, actual experience being different from our assumptions, special benefits to terminated employees, and/or changes in benefits provided under the plans.\n\u2022Discount rate - This interest assumption is based on the yield derived from a portfolio of high quality fixed income corporate debt instruments that reasonably match the timing and amounts of projected future benefits for each of our retirement-related benefit plans. The rate is determined at the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases our net periodic benefit cost.\n\u2022Long-term rate of return - This assumption is selected from a range of probable return outcomes from an analysis of the asset portfolio. The market-related value as it relates to our estimate of long-term rate of return equals the fair value of plan assets, determined as of the measurement date. The return on plan assets recognizes all asset gains and losses, including changes in fair value, through the measurement date. Our expectations for the future investment returns of the asset categories are based on a combination of historical market performance, evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists, and current market yields. The expected return for the total portfolio is calculated based on the plan's strategic asset allocation. The actual rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the fair value of the plan assets at the beginning and the end of the period, adjusted for contributions and benefit payments. A lower long-term rate of return on plan assets increases our net periodic benefit cost.\nInvestment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews. Risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition. We believe our investment portfolios are well diversified by asset class and sector, with no undue risk concentrations in any one category. See Note 9 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of the investment portfolios for our plans.\n\u2022Mortality rate - This assumption reflects our best estimate, as of the measurement date, of the life expectancies of plan participants in order to determine the expected length of time for benefit payments. We derive our assumptions from industry mortality tables.\nThe weighted average assumptions used in the measurement of our net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31 are as follows:\nThe following illustrates the sensitivity of the below items to a 50 basis point change in the discount rate or the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets:\nBenefit Obligation and Fair Value of Plan Assets\nDuring 2020, the fair value of plan assets in our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan increased $110.9 million, or 6.9 percent due to a favorable return on assets which resulted in a gain of approximately 14.2 percent, partially offset by the payment of benefits and expenses. The fair value of plan assets in our U.K. pension plan increased \u00a324.4 million, or 12.8 percent, due primarily to a favorable return on assets which resulted in a gain of approximately 14.9 percent. Although our rate of return on plan assets for 2020 exceeded our assumptions used in the measurement of our net periodic benefit costs, we believe our assumptions appropriately reflect the impact of the current economic environment and our expectations for the future investment returns based on the plan's asset allocation.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our pension and OPEB plans have an aggregate unrecognized net actuarial loss of $827.4 million and an unrecognized prior service credit of $2.1 million, which together represent the cumulative liability and asset gains and losses as well as the portion of prior service credits that have not been recognized in pension expense. The unrecognized net actuarial loss for our pension plans, which is $838.4 million at December 31, 2020, will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan, which is approximately 25 years for the U.S. plan and 31 years for the U.K. plan, to the extent that it exceeds the 10 percent corridor, as described below. The unrecognized net actuarial gain of $11.0 million for our OPEB plan will be amortized over the average future working life of OPEB plan participants, estimated at three years, to the extent the gain is outside of the corridor. The corridor for the pension and OPEB plans is established based on the greater of 10 percent of the plan assets or 10 percent of the benefit obligation. At December 31, 2020, $539.4 million of the actuarial loss was outside of the corridor for the U.S. plans and \u00a329.6 million was outside of the corridor for the U.K. plan. At December 31, 2020, none of the actuarial gain was outside of the corridor for the OPEB plan.\nThe amortization of the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss and the unrecognized prior service credit is a component of our net periodic benefit cost and equaled $19.7 million, $18.4 million, and $22.1 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nThe fair value of plan assets in our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan was $1,710.9 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $1,600.0 million at December 31, 2019. The plan was in an underfunded position of $339.0 million and $300.8 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. This year-over-year change was due primarily to the increase in period benefit obligations due to the decrease in discount rate, partially offset by higher than expected asset returns.\nThe fair value of plan assets in our U.K. pension plan was \u00a3215.1 million at December 31, 2020, compared to \u00a3190.7 million at December 31, 2019. The U.K. pension plan was in an underfunded position of \u00a34.3 million and \u00a33.1 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This year-over-year change was due primarily to the increase in period benefit obligations due to the decrease in discount rate, partially offset by higher than expected asset returns.\nThe fair value of plan assets in our OPEB plan was $9.3 million and $9.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These assets represent life insurance contracts to fund the life insurance benefit portion of our OPEB plan. Our OPEB plan represents a non-vested, non-guaranteed obligation, and current regulations do not require specific funding levels for these benefits, which are comprised of retiree life, medical, and dental benefits. It is our practice to use general assets to pay medical and dental claims as they come due in lieu of utilizing plan assets for the medical and dental benefit portions of our OPEB plan.\nSee Note 9 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for federal, state, and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Our accounting for income taxes represents our best estimate of various events and transactions. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect profitability.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining valuation allowances. In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we determine that we most likely will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an increase to the valuation allowance is charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance is reversed.\nIn establishing a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, assumptions are made in determining whether, and to what extent, a tax position may be sustained. GAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The evaluation of a tax position is a two step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is to measure a position that satisfies the recognition threshold at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold but that now satisfy the recognition threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. If a previously recognized tax position is settled for an amount that is different from the amount initially measured, the difference will be recognized as a tax benefit or expense in the period the settlement is effective.\nChanges in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on our provision for income tax and our effective tax rate, which could significantly affect the amounts reported in our financial statements.\nIn 2018, we refined our calculations during the one-year measurement period after the enactment date of TCJA as allowed by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 and increased our provisional Repatriation Tax estimate by $11.5 million to $77.9 million.\nSee \"Regulation\" contained herein in Item 1. See Note 7 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8.\nContingent Liabilities\nOn a quarterly basis, we review relevant information with respect to litigation and contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. An estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable outcome of pending litigation or regulatory matters depending, in part, on our results of operations or cash flows for the particular period. See Note 14 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8.\nAccounting Developments\nFor information on new accounting standards and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see Note 1 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8.\nConsolidated Operating Results\nFluctuations in exchange rates, particularly between the British pound sterling and the U.S. dollar for our U.K. operations, have an effect on our consolidated financial results. In periods when the pound weakens relative to the preceding period, translating pounds into dollars decreases current period results relative to the prior period. In periods when the pound strengthens, translating pounds into dollars increases current period results relative to the prior period.\nThe weighted average pound/dollar exchange rate for our Unum UK line of business was 1.287, 1.279, and 1.336 for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. If the 2019 and 2018 results for our U.K. operations had been translated at the 2020 exchange rate, our adjusted operating revenue by segment would have been higher by approximately $5 million in 2019, but lower by approximately $24 million in 2018. Additionally, our adjusted operating income would have been higher by approximately $1 million in 2019, but lower by approximately $4 million in 2018. However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert pounds into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting item and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the U.K.\nPremium income increased in 2020 and 2019 in each of our principal operating business segments, while premium income continues to decline, as expected, in our Closed Block segment.\nNet investment income was lower in 2020, relative to 2019, due to a decline in the yield on invested assets, a decrease in the level of invested assets supporting the Closed Block individual disability product line resulting from the reinsurance transaction that closed in December 2020, and lower income on our private equity partnerships. Partially offsetting the decline was an increase in the level of invested assets for our remaining product lines and higher miscellaneous investment income. Net investment income in 2019 was slightly lower than 2018 due to lower miscellaneous investment income and a decline in the yield on invested assets, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets.\nWe recognized a net realized investment gain totaling $1,302.3 million in 2020 related to the transfer of investments in the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction. Credit losses on fixed maturity securities of $53.6 million were recognized in net realized investment gains and losses in 2020 compared to $25.3 million and $17.5 million in 2019 and 2018. We also recognized $36.6 million of impairment losses in 2020 related to certain of our home office buildings available for lease and classified as investment real estate. Also, included in net realized investment gains and losses were changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement, which resulted in realized gains (losses) of $(17.0) million, $8.3 million, and $(15.2) million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. See Notes 3 and 4 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.\nOther income is primarily comprised of fee-based service products in the Unum US segment, which include leave management services and administrative only (ASO) business, and the underlying results and associated net investment income of certain assumed blocks of individual disability reinsured business in the Closed Block segment.\nOverall benefits experience was unfavorable in 2020 relative to the prior periods, with a consolidated benefit ratio of 95.7 percent in 2020 compared to 80.0 percent in 2019 and 89.3 percent in 2018. Excluding the 2020 long-term care reserve increase, group pension reserve increase and impacts from the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction the benefit ratio for 2020 was 80.2 percent. Excluding the 2018 long-term care reserve increase, the benefit ratio for 2018 was 80.9 percent. The underlying benefits experience for each of our operating business segments is discussed more fully in \"Segment Results\" contained herein in this Item 7.\nCommissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were lower in 2020 compared to 2019 driven primarily by lower sales in our Unum US voluntary benefits product line and Colonial Life segment. Commissions increased in 2019 compared to 2018 driven primarily by sales growth. The deferral of acquisition costs was lower during 2019 relative to 2018 due primarily to a shift in product mix that resulted in lower first-year commissions and a lower corresponding deferral of acquisition costs in the Unum US supplemental and voluntary product line. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs was generally consistent with 2019. Growth in the level of the deferred asset in our Unum US and Colonial Life segments resulted in higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2019 compared to 2018. Also contributing to the increase in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2019 was a higher level of policy terminations experienced in the Unum US voluntary benefits product line and the impact of the prospective unlocking for future experience relative to assumptions in certain of our Colonial life products.\nInterest and debt expense increased year-over-year in 2020 and 2019 due primarily to a higher level of outstanding debt. Cost related to early retirement of debt includes costs associated with the purchase and retirement of $433.1 million aggregate liquidation/principal amount of our outstanding capital and debt securities in 2019. See Note 8 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.\nOther expenses, including compensation expense, increased in each of the years presented above due to operational investments in our business and growth in our fee-based service products, which was balanced with our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies. Included in other expenses for 2020 are costs related to an organizational design update, an impairment loss on the ROU asset related to an operating lease for office space, costs related to the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction, and an increase in the provision for the allowance for expected credit losses on premium receivable balances.\nOur effective income tax rate for 2020 was 17.7 percent, compared to 20.4 percent in 2019 and 16.6 percent in 2018. Our 2020, 2019, and 2018 effective tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent due to favorable tax credits, with additional favorable adjustments in 2018 related to our prior year tax return. Also impacting the difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory rate in 2020 was the unfavorable impact of the U.K. tax rate increase, as well as the favorable impact related to net operating loss carryback. See Note 7 in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.\nConsolidated Sales Results\nShown below are sales results for our three principal operating business segments.\nSales shown in the preceding chart generally represent the annualized premium income on new sales which we expect to receive and report as premium income during the next 12 months following or beginning in the initial quarter in which the sale is reported, depending on the effective date of the new sale. Sales do not correspond to premium income reported as revenue in accordance with GAAP. This is because new annualized sales premiums reflect current sales performance and what we expect to recognize as premium income over a 12 month period, while premium income reported in our financial statements is reported on an \"as earned\" basis rather than an annualized basis and also includes renewals and persistency of in-force policies written in prior years as well as current new sales.\nSales, persistency of the existing block of business, employment and salary growth, and the effectiveness of a renewal program are indicators of growth in premium income. Trends in new sales, as well as existing market share, also indicate the potential for growth in our respective markets and the level of market acceptance of price levels and new product offerings. Sales results may fluctuate significantly due to case size and timing of sales submissions. Given the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to experience further disruption in our sales activity in 2021.\nSee \"Segment Results\" as follows for a discussion of sales by segment.\nSegment Results\nOur reporting segments are comprised of the following: Unum US, Unum International, Colonial Life, Closed Block, and Corporate. Financial information for each of our reporting segments is as follows.\nIn describing our results, we may at times note certain items and exclude the impact on financial ratios and metrics to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur. We also measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of \"adjusted operating revenue\" and \"adjusted operating income\" or \"adjusted operating loss\", which differ from total revenue and income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and certain other items. These performance measures are in accordance with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for total revenue, income before income tax, or net income. See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" contained herein in this Item 7.\nUnum US Segment\nThe Unum US segment is comprised of group disability insurance, which includes our long-term and short-term disability products, our medical stop-loss product, and our fee-based leave management services and ASO business, group life and accidental death and dismemberment products, and supplemental and voluntary lines of business, which are comprised of individual disability, voluntary benefits, and dental and vision products.\nUnum US Operating Results\nShown below are financial results for the Unum US segment. In the sections following, financial results and key ratios are also presented for the major lines of business within the segment.\nUnum US Group Disability Operating Results\nShown below are financial results and key performance indicators for Unum US group disability.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019\nPremium income increased compared to 2019, driven primarily by growth in the in-force block resulting from higher prior period sales, partially offset by lower persistency in the short-term disability product line. Net investment income was lower relative to 2019 due to a decline in yield on invested assets and a lower level of invested assets, partially offset by higher miscellaneous investment income. Other income increased relative to 2019 due to continued growth in our fee-based service products.\nBenefits experience was favorable compared to 2019 due primarily to favorable claim recovery experience in our group long-term disability product line, partially offset by higher claims incidence in the short-term disability product line, resulting from the impacts of COVID-19.\nCommissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were slightly lower compared to 2019 due to lower sales. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased relative to 2019 due to growth in the level of the deferred asset. Our other expense ratio for 2020 increased compared to 2019 due primarily to an increase in expenses associated with the administration of our fee-based service products, partially elevated from higher volumes due to the current COVID-19 environment. Also contributing to the higher expense ratio was an increase in operational investments in our business which was balanced with our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.\nWe had goodwill of $8.9 million at December 31, 2020, none of which is currently believed to be at risk for future impairment.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\nPremium income increased compared to 2018, driven primarily by growth in the in-force block resulting from higher prior period sales and higher persistency in the group short-term disability product line. Net investment income was lower relative to 2018 due to lower miscellaneous investment income, a decline in yield on invested assets, and a lower level of invested assets. Other income increased relative to 2018 due to growth in our fee-based service products.\nBenefits experience was favorable compared to 2018 due primarily to favorable claim recovery experience in our group long-term disability product line, partially offset by higher claims incidence in both our group long-term and short-term disability product lines.\nCommissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were higher compared to 2018 due to sales growth. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased relative to 2018 due to growth in the level of the deferred asset. Our other expense ratio for 2019 increased compared to 2018 due primarily to an increase in operational investments in our business and growth in our fee-based service products, which was balanced with our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.\nUnum US Group Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment Operating Results\nShown below are financial results and key performance indicators for Unum US group life and accidental death and dismemberment.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019\nPremium income decreased compared to 2019 due to lower sales and persistency. Net investment income was lower compared to 2019 due to a decline in yield on invested assets and a lower level of invested assets.\nBenefits experience was unfavorable compared to 2019 due primarily to higher claims incidence in the group life product line, resulting from the impacts of COVID-19, partially offset by favorable experience in the accidental death and dismemberment product line.\nCommissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were lower compared to 2019 due to lower sales. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased relative to 2019 due to growth in the level of the deferred asset. The other expense ratio was consistent with 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\nPremium income increased compared to 2018 due to growth in the in-force block resulting from prior period sales growth. Net investment income was slightly higher in 2019 compared to 2018 due to a higher level of invested assets, partially offset by lower miscellaneous income and a decline in yield on invested assets.\nBenefits experience was unfavorable compared to 2018 due primarily to a higher average claim size in the group life product line.\nCommissions were higher compared to 2018 due to prior period sales growth. The deferral of acquisition costs was generally consistent with 2018. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased relative to 2018 due to growth in the level of the deferred asset. The other expense ratio improved compared to 2018 due to our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies balanced with operational investments in our business.\nUnum US Supplemental and Voluntary Operating Results\nShown below are financial results and key performance indicators for Unum US supplemental and voluntary product lines.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019\nPremium income decreased compared to 2019, with a decline in the voluntary benefits product line, mostly offset by growth in the individual disability and dental and vision product lines. Net investment income was higher compared to 2019 due to higher miscellaneous investment income and an increase in the level of invested assets, partially offset by a decline in yield on invested assets.\nBenefits experience for the individual disability product line was favorable compared to 2019 due to both favorable claim recoveries and mortality experience. Benefits experience for voluntary benefits was unfavorable compared to 2019 due primarily to higher claims incidence in the life and disability product line, resulting from the impacts of COVID-19. Benefits experience for the dental and vision product line was favorable compared to 2019 driven by lower claims incidence resulting from the impacts of COVID-19.\nCommissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were lower in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to lower sales in the voluntary benefits product line. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs decreased in 2020 relative to 2019 due primarily to a decline in the level of the deferred asset in the voluntary benefits product line. The other expense ratio was consistent compared to 2019 due to our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.\nWe had goodwill of $271.1 million at December 31, 2020, none of which is currently believed to be at risk for future impairment.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\nPremium income increased compared to 2018 driven by prior period sales growth and the continued expansion of our dental and vision product line, partially offset by unfavorable persistency. Net investment income was lower compared to 2018 due to lower miscellaneous investment income and a decline in yield on invested assets, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets.\nBenefits experience for the individual disability product line was slightly less favorable compared to 2018 due to less favorable mortality experience, mostly offset by lower claims incidence and favorable claim recovery experience. Benefits experience for voluntary benefits was favorable compared to 2018 due primarily to the release of active life reserves resulting from a higher level of policy terminations during 2019. Benefits experience for the dental and vision product line was unfavorable compared to 2018 driven by higher claims utilization.\nCommissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were lower in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a shift in product mix that resulted in lower first-year commissions and a lower corresponding deferral of acquisition costs, partially offset by higher sales in the dental and vision product line. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased in 2019 relative to 2018 due primarily to the impact of a higher level of policy terminations, particularly in the voluntary benefits product line. Our other expense ratio improved relative to 2018 due to growth in premium income and our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies balanced with operational investments in our business.\nSales\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019\nGroup sales increased in the core market, which we define as employee groups with fewer than 2,000 employees, compared to 2019 due to growth in our medical stop-loss product, partially offset by lower sales to new and existing customers in our group disability and group life products. Group sales declined in the large case market compared to 2019 due to lower sales to new and existing customers in all products. The sales mix in the group market sector for 2020 was approximately 61 percent core market and 39 percent large case market.\nIndividual disability sales, which are primarily concentrated in the multi-life market, decreased compared to 2019 due to lower sales to both new and existing customers. Voluntary benefits sales decreased compared to 2019, driven by lower new and existing customer sales in both the core and large case markets. Dental and vision sales decreased compared to 2019 driven by lower sales to both new and existing customers.\nWe believe the lower sales levels during 2020 compared to 2019 are driven by the impact of COVID-19, which has caused higher unemployment levels and general uncertainty around the financial condition of our customers as well as disruption in our sales processes. Further discussion of COVID-19 is contained herein in \"Executive Summary\" in this Item 7.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\nGroup sales declined slightly compared to 2018 due to lower new customer sales in both the core market and large case markets, partially offset by higher sales to existing customers in both the core and large case markets and growth in our medical stop-loss product. The sales mix in the group market sector for 2019 was approximately 56 percent core market and 44 percent large case market.\nIndividual disability sales decreased compared to 2018 due to lower sales to new customers. Voluntary benefits sales decreased slightly compared to 2018, primarily driven by lower sales to new customers in the core market, partially offset by higher sales\nto new customers in the large case market. Dental and vision sales increased compared to 2018 driven by higher sales to both new and existing customers.\nSegment Outlook\nWe remain committed to offering consumers a broad set of financial protection benefit products at the worksite. During 2021, we will continue to invest in a unique customer experience defined by simplicity, empathy, and deep industry expertise through the re-design of our processes and the increased utilization of digital capabilities and technology to enhance enrollment, underwriting, and claims processing. In addition, we will continue to focus on the expansion of our portfolio of products. In particular, with respect to smaller employers, we will continue to provide comprehensive consumer-focused products, enhance our distribution model, and utilize our MyUnum platform and digital tools to bring industry leading enrollment capabilities and a fully integrated customer experience. Our differentiated offering with HR Connect and significant investment in leave management services will allow for substantial growth opportunities, particularly with larger employers, and stronger persistency in our core products. We believe our active client management and differentiated integrated customer experience across our product lines, underpinned by strong risk management, will continue to enable us to grow our market over the long-term.\nGiven the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to experience further disruption in our sales activity and ultimately premium income in 2021, particularly in the first half of the year. We could also continue to experience claims volatility, particularly in our short-term disability and group and voluntary life products as well as potential disruption in our overall claims processing activity which can result in short-term unfavorable experience. In addition, we could continue to experience an increase in the volume of activity associated with our leave management product which would lead to an increase in expenses. The low interest rate environment continues to place pressure on our profit margins by impacting net investment income yields as well as potentially discount rates on our insurance liabilities. Our net investment income may continue to be unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in miscellaneous investment income. As part of our continued pricing discipline and our reserving methodology, we continuously monitor emerging interest rate experience and adjust our pricing and reserve discount rates, as appropriate. We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and adjust our business plans accordingly.\nUnum International Segment\nThe Unum International segment is comprised of our operations in both the United Kingdom and Poland. Our Unum UK products include insurance for group long-term disability, group life, and supplemental lines of business, which includes dental, individual disability, and critical illness products. Our Unum Poland products include insurance for individual and group life with accident and health riders. Unum International's products are sold primarily through field sales personnel and independent brokers and consultants.\nOperating Results\nShown below are financial results and key performance indicators for the Unum International segment.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currencies of Unum UK and Unum Poland are the British pound sterling and Polish zloty, respectively. Premium income, net investment income, claims, and expenses are received or paid in the functional currency, and we hold functional currency-denominated assets to support functional currency-denominated policy reserves and liabilities. We translate functional currency-denominated financial statement items into dollars for our consolidated financial reporting. We translate income statement items using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate balance sheet items using the exchange rate at the end of the period. We report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets.\nFluctuations in exchange rates have an effect on Unum International's reported financial results and our consolidated financial results. In periods when the functional currency strengthens relative to the preceding period, translation increases current period\nresults relative to the prior period. In periods when the functional currency weakens, translation decreases current period results relative to the prior period.\nGoodwill\nWe had total goodwill of $45.3 million for the Unum International segment at December 31, 2020, of which, $40.2 million is attributed to the Unum UK reporting unit and $5.1 million is attributed to the Unum Poland reporting unit. Fair value of our reporting units is estimated using a combination of the income and market approaches and the key assumptions used are projected earnings and discount rate. To the extent that the future profitability of these reporting units deteriorates from current assumptions, the goodwill related to the reporting units could be at risk for impairment.\nUnum UK Operating Results\nShown below are financial results and key performance indicators for the Unum UK product lines in functional currency.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019\nPremium income was higher compared to 2019 due to growth in the in-force blocks and the impact of rate increases in the group long-term disability product line.\nNet investment income was lower compared to 2019 due to lower miscellaneous investment income resulting from a higher than normal level of bond calls in 2019, a decline in the yield on fixed-rate bonds, and lower investment income from inflation index-linked bonds. Our investments in inflation index-linked bonds support the claim reserves associated with certain group policies that provide for inflation-linked increases in benefits. The change in net investment income attributable to these index-linked bonds is generally offset by a change in the reserves for future claim payments related to the inflation index-linked group long-term disability and group life policies.\nBenefits experience was unfavorable relative to 2019 due to lower claim resolutions in the group long-term disability product line resulting from the continued disruption in claim processes related to COVID-19 and higher claim incidence in the group life product line, partially offset by the impact of lower inflation-linked increases in benefits related to our group products.\nCommissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were lower relative to 2019 due to lower sales. The amortization of acquisition costs was generally consistent with the prior year. The other expense ratio increased relative to 2019 with certain expenses related to COVID-19 mostly offset by our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\nPremium income increased compared to 2018 due to higher overall persistency, sales growth, and the impact of rate increases in the group long-term disability product line.\nNet investment income increased compared to 2018 due to higher miscellaneous investment income that resulted from a higher than normal level of bond calls, and a higher level of invested assets, partially offset by a lower yield on fixed-rate bonds and lower investment income from inflation index-linked bonds. The decrease in net investment income attributable to these index-linked bonds was offset by a decrease in the reserves for future claim payments related to the inflation index-linked group long-term disability and group life policies.\nBenefits experience was unfavorable relative to 2018 due to unfavorable mortality experience and a reduction in the claim reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the higher than normal level of bond calls experienced during 2019, partially offset by lower inflation-linked increases in benefits related to our group products.\nCommissions and the deferral of acquisition costs increased relative to 2018 due to higher sales. The amortization of acquisition costs was lower in 2019 compared to 2018 due to a decline in the level of the deferred asset. The other expense ratio was lower relative to 2018 due to higher premiums and our continued focus on expense management.\nSales\nThe following discussion of sales results relates only to our Unum UK product lines and is based on functional currency.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019\nGroup long-term disability sales were lower in 2020 compared to 2019, with lower sales to new and existing customers in both the core market, which we define as employee groups with fewer than 500 employees, and the large case market.\nGroup life sales declined in 2020 compared to 2019 due to a decrease in sales to new customers in both our core and large case markets and lower sales to existing customers in the large case market, partially offset by higher sales to existing customers in our core market.\nSupplemental sales were lower in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to a decline in dental product sales, partially offset by an increase in the group critical illness product line.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\nGroup long-term disability sales were generally consistent with 2018, with higher sales to new customers in our core market, mostly offset by a decline in sales to both new and existing customers in our large case market.\nGroup life sales were higher in 2019 compared to 2018 due to an increase in sales to new and existing customers in both our core and large case markets.\nSupplemental sales were higher in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher sales in the group critical illness product line.\nSegment Outlook\nWe are committed to driving growth in the Unum International segment and will build on the capabilities that we believe will generate growth and profitability in our businesses over the long term. Within our Unum UK line of business, expanding our group long-term disability market position remains a priority. In addition, we will continue to focus on increasing participation levels while also developing new distribution and services to reach new small case clients, such as utilizing our Help@hand application. We will also continue the implementation of price increases and will maintain our disciplined sales approach. Within our Unum Poland line of business, we will leverage our U.S. and U.K. expertise to grow existing distribution channels and expand our current product offerings. We continue to invest in digital capabilities, technology, and product enhancements which we believe will drive sustainable growth over the long term.\nGiven the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to experience further disruption to our financial results in 2021. Sales activity could be lower and we could also continue to experience claims volatility in our group life and disability product lines. Uncertainty in the U.K. economy may continue to pressure our growth expectations in the near-term and may also lead to lower claim discount rates. However, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on future growth opportunities as the operating environment improves. As part of our continued pricing discipline and our reserving strategy, we continuously monitor emerging interest rate experience and adjust our pricing and reserve discount rates, as appropriate. We will likely continue to experience volatility in net investment income and our benefit ratio due to fluctuations in the level of inflation in the U.K.; however, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on adjusted operating income We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and adjust our business plans accordingly to respond to external challenges.\nColonial Life Segment\nThe Colonial Life segment includes insurance for accident, sickness, and disability products, which includes our dental and vision products, life products, and cancer and critical illness products issued primarily by Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company and marketed to employees, on both a group and an individual basis, at the workplace through an independent contractor agency sales force and brokers.\nOperating Results\nShown below are financial results and key performance indicators for the Colonial Life segment.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019\nPremium income increased compared to 2019 due to growth in the in-force block resulting from prior period sales growth and stable persistency. Net investment income was higher in 2020 compared to 2019 due to higher miscellaneous investment income and an increase in the level of invested assets, partially offset by a decline in the yield on invested assets.\nBenefits experience was unfavorable relative to 2019, with unfavorable experience in the life product line, resulting from the impacts of COVID-19, partially offset by favorable experience in the cancer and critical illness and accident, sickness, and disability product lines.\nCommissions and the deferral of acquisition costs declined relative to 2019 due to lower sales. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs was consistent with 2019. The other expense ratio improved relative to 2019 due to a decline in sales-related expenses and our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.\nWe had goodwill of $27.7 million at December 31, 2020, none of which is currently believed to be at risk for future impairment.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\nPremium income increased compared to 2018 as a result of growth in the in-force block resulting from prior period sales growth, which includes the expansion of our dental and vision products, offset partially by lower persistency. Net investment income decreased relative to 2018 due to a lower yield on invested assets and lower miscellaneous investment income, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets.\nBenefits experience was generally consistent with 2018, with favorable experience in the life line of business mostly offset by unfavorable experience in the accident, sickness, and disability and cancer and critical illness product lines.\nCommissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were generally consistent with 2018 due to stable sales results relative to the prior year. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased compared to 2018 due primarily to overall growth in the level of the deferred asset and the impact of the prospective unlocking for future experience relative to assumptions for our interest-sensitive voluntary life products. The other expense ratio improved relative to 2018 due to an increase in premium income and our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.\nSales\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe impact of COVID-19 has caused higher unemployment levels and general uncertainty around the financial condition of our customers as well as disruption in our sales processes. As a result, sales for each of our product lines and market sectors have declined during 2020 compared to 2019. The number of new accounts and average new case size decreased 27.9 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\nCommercial market sales decreased primarily due to lower new customer account sales in both the core market, which we define as accounts with fewer than 1,000 employees, and the large case market, partially offset by higher existing customer account sales in the core market and the continued expansion of our dental and vision products. The increase in our public sector market for 2019 was driven by an increase in both new and existing customer account sales. The number of new accounts and average new case size decreased 4.5 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018.\nSegment Outlook\nWe remain committed to providing employees and their families with simple, modern, and personal benefit solutions. During 2021, we will continue to utilize our strong distribution system of agency sales personnel, benefit counselors and broker partnerships. We will also continue to invest in new solutions and digital capabilities to expand our reach and effectiveness, driving growth and improving productivity while enhancing the customer experience. In 2021, we will also bring an enhanced engagement and enrollment platform to market enabling deeper connections with employees through the enrollment process as well as maintaining stronger relationships throughout the customer lifecycle. We believe our distribution system, customer service capabilities, digital and virtual tools, and ability to serve all market sizes position us well for future growth in the long-term.\nGiven the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to experience further disruption in our sales activity, persistency, and ultimately, premium income in 2021. We could also continue to experience claims volatility, particularly in our life and disability products. The lower interest rate environment will continue to have an unfavorable impact on our profit margins, and volatility in miscellaneous investment income is likely to continue. While we believe our underlying profitability will remain strong, current economic conditions and increasing competition in the voluntary workplace market are seen as external risks to achievement of our business plans. We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and adjust our business plans accordingly.\nClosed Block Segment\nThe Closed Block segment consists of group and individual long-term care, individual disability, and other insurance products no longer actively marketed. We discontinued offering individual long-term care in 2009 and group long-term care in 2012. Individual disability in this segment generally consists of policies we sold prior to the mid-1990s and entirely discontinued selling in 2004. In December 2020, we ceded a significant portion of this individual disability business to a third party reinsurer. See \"Executive Summary\" herein Item 7 for further discussion. Other insurance products include group pension, individual life and corporate-owned life insurance, reinsurance pools and management operations, and other miscellaneous product lines.\nOperating Results\nShown below are financial results and key performance indicators for the Closed Block segment.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019\nPremium income for long-term care was higher compared to 2019, with rate increases more than offsetting policy terminations. We continue to file requests with various state insurance departments for premium rate increases on certain of our individual and group long-term care policies which reflect assumptions as of the date of filings. In states for which a rate increase is submitted and approved, we routinely provide customers options for coverage changes or other approaches that might fit their current financial and insurance needs. Premium income for individual disability was lower compared to 2019 due to policy terminations and maturities as well as a one-time reinsurance cost related to a small block of policies during the first quarter of 2020.\nNet investment income was lower relative to 2019 primarily due to a lower yield on invested assets, a decrease in the level of invested assets supporting individual disability resulting from the reinsurance transaction that closed in December 2020, and fluctuations in the net asset values (NAV) on our private equity partnerships that reflect the impact of COVID-19 on economic conditions throughout the year. These impacts are partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets supporting long-term care. Other income, which includes the underlying results and associated net investment income of certain assumed blocks of individual disability business, continues to decline due to expected terminations and maturities.\nThe interest adjusted loss ratio for long-term care, excluding the previously discussed reserve increase, was favorable to our expectations driven primarily by higher claimant mortality and lower submitted claims. The interest adjusted loss ratio for individual disability, excluding the impacts from the reinsurance transaction that closed in December 2020, was unfavorable relative to 2019 driven by overall unfavorable claims activity and the impact of the one-time reinsurance cost during the first quarter of 2020.\nAlso impacting benefits experience for the Closed Block segment was the previously discussed group pension reserve increase within our \"All Other\" product line. Excluding this group pension reserve increase, benefits experience for the \"All Other\" product line was consistent with our expectations.\nInterest and debt expense was lower than 2019 due to the principal repayments on the outstanding debt issued by Northwind Holdings, LLC (Northwind Holdings). In December 2020, Northwind Holdings redeemed the remaining $35.0 million of principal on the Northwind notes, and was released of any contractual collateral requirements.\nThe other expense ratio, excluding certain costs incurred and the amortization of cost of reinsurance related to the previously discussed reinsurance transaction in the fourth quarter of 2020, was lower than 2019 due to our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies, partially offset by a decline in premium income for individual disability.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\nPremium income for long-term care was generally consistent with 2018, with rate increases offsetting policy terminations. Premium income for individual disability decreased compared to 2018 due to policy terminations and maturities.\nNet investment income was higher relative to 2018 primarily due to an increase in the level of invested assets, partially offset by lower miscellaneous investment income. Other income continues to decline due to expected terminations and maturities.\nThe interest adjusted loss ratio for long-term care in 2019 was not comparable to 2018, excluding the previously discussed reserve increase, due to the update in our assumptions during the third quarter of 2018, but was generally consistent with our expectations during 2019. Individual disability benefits experience was favorable relative to 2018 driven by overall favorable claims activity.\nThe other expense ratio was higher than 2018 due to the expected decline in premium income for individual disability, partially offset by our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.\nSegment Outlook\nWe will continue to execute on our well-defined strategy of implementing long-term care premium rate increases, efficient capital management, improved financial analysis, and operational effectiveness. We will continue to explore structural options to enhance financial flexibility. Despite continued anticipated premium rate increases in our long-term care business, we expect overall premium income and adjusted operating revenue to decline over time as these closed blocks of business wind down. We will likely experience volatility in net investment income due to fluctuations of miscellaneous investment income and the increased allocation towards alternative assets, primarily private equity partnership investments, in the long-term care product line portfolio. We record changes in our share of the NAV of the partnerships in net investment income. We receive financial information related to our investments in partnerships and generally record investment income on a one-quarter lag in accordance with our accounting policy. As these net asset values are volatile and can fluctuate materially with changes in market economic conditions, there may possibly be significant movements up or down in future periods as conditions change. We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and adjust our business plans accordingly.\nProfitability of our long-tailed products is affected by claims experience related to mortality and morbidity, resolutions, investment returns, premium rate increases, and persistency. We believe that the interest adjusted loss ratio for long-term care will be relatively flat over the long term, but may continue to experience quarterly volatility, particularly in the near term as our claim block matures and as we continue the implementation of premium rate increases. Specific to our long-term care line of business, which is in loss recognition and should report levels of benefits plus operating expenses that equal the gross premium reported, we expect the long term interest adjusted loss ratio to be in the 85 to 90 percent range with some quarterly volatility. Claim resolution rates, which measure the resolution of claims from recovery, deaths, settlements, and benefit expirations, are very sensitive to operational and external factors and can be volatile. Our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period. It is possible that variability in any of our reserve assumptions, including, but not limited to, interest rates, mortality, morbidity, resolutions, premium rate increases, benefit change elections, and persistency, could result in a material impact on the adequacy of our reserves, including adjustments to reserves established under loss recognition.\nAs a result of the execution of the first phase of the reinsurance agreement related to our individual disability line of business in December 2020 where we have fully ceded a significant portion of this business, we expect that the primary impact on earnings will be the amortization of the cost of reinsurance for that agreement which we expect to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million for 2021 and will continue to be amortized on a declining trajectory consistent with the expected run-off pattern of the ceded reserves, which we estimate to be approximately 25 years. We expect that the second phase of this transaction will be executed in the first quarter of 2021. Due to the relatively small amount of business that will be retained following completion of the second phase of this transaction, we expect that the interest adjusted loss ratio will be more volatile from period to period, however, should remain within our historical experience over the long-term and we expect minimal earnings related to the retained business.\nIn consideration of the recent COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts, we expect our Closed Block segment could temporarily experience greater than normal volatility across multiple risk factors. Specific to our long-term care line of business, we expect that we may experience an increase in mortality as well as a decrease in incidence and interest rates.\nCorporate Segment\nThe Corporate segment includes investment income on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, interest expense on corporate debt other than non-recourse debt, and certain other corporate income and expenses not allocated to a line of business.\nOperating Results\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNet investment income was lower in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by a decline in the yield on invested assets.\nInterest, debt, and other expenses were higher in 2020 relative to 2019. Interest, debt, and other expenses includes the costs related to an organizational design update and the impairment loss on ROU asset during 2020, and the early retirement of debt during 2019. Excluding these items, interest, debt, and other expenses in 2020 were generally consistent with 2019 with higher interest expense resulting from a higher level of outstanding debt, mostly offset by lower pension costs in 2020. See \"Executive Summary\u201d contained herein in Item 7 for further discussion.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet investment income was lower in 2019 due primarily to both a lower yield and a lower level of invested assets.\nInterest, debt, and other expenses were higher in 2019 relative to 2018, driven primarily by costs related to the early retirement of debt, higher pension costs, and a higher level of outstanding debt, partially offset by acquisition and restructuring costs in 2018 that did not recur. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt\u201d contained herein in Item 7 for further discussion.\nSegment Outlook\nWe expect to continue to generate excess capital on an annual basis through the statutory earnings in our insurance subsidiaries and believe we are well positioned with flexibility to preserve our capital strength while also returning capital to our shareholders.\nInvestments\nOverview\nOur investment portfolio is well diversified by type of investment and industry sector. We have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations and allow us to hold our securities through periods where significant decreases in fair value occur. We believe our emphasis on risk management in our investment portfolio has positioned us well and generally reduced the volatility in our results.\nWe have a formal investment policy that includes overall quality and diversification objectives and establishes limits by asset class, investment rating, and single issuer. The majority of our investments are in investment-grade publicly traded securities. This ensures the desired liquidity and preserves the capital value of our portfolios, although due to the long-term nature of our insurance liabilities we are also able to invest in less liquid investments to obtain superior returns within the limits of our investment policy. Our asset mix guidelines and limits are established by us, reviewed by the risk and finance committee of Unum Group's board of directors, and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries. We review our policies and guidelines annually, or more frequently if deemed necessary, and recommend adjustments as appropriate.\nSee \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" contained herein in this Item 7 for further discussion of our valuation of investments.\nClosed Block Individual Disability Reinsurance Agreement\nAs part of the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance agreement entered into in December 2020 with Commonwealth, we transferred fixed maturity securities of $4,686.8 million on an amortized cost basis and $5,958.4 million on a fair value basis and we recorded a total realized investment gain from the transfer of these securities, including a related net gain from cash flow hedges of $1,302.3 million. Although we transferred a significant portion of our fixed maturity security portfolio as part of this agreement, the overall credit profile of our remaining portfolio has not changed. See \"Executive Summary\" for further information on the reinsurance transaction contained herein in this Item 7.\nCOVID-19\nThe current economic conditions have increased volatility in the capital markets and have caused significant pressure on the profitability of many companies. The sharp decline in oil prices experienced earlier in the year and lack of demand due to COVID-19, which began to occur in the first quarter of 2020, also caused pressure on the profitability of companies in the energy sector. We recorded credit losses during the first quarter of 2020 primarily related to fixed maturity securities issued by companies in the energy sector, but recorded minimal credit losses related to energy securities in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2020 primarily as a result of the improvement in oil prices. Our fixed income exposure to consumer cyclicals, which have been stressed due to COVID-19 related shutdowns, is 3.6 percent of our fixed maturity security portfolio. Our exposure to other stressed industries such as airlines is minimal at 0.2 percent of our fixed maturity security portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had $759.4 million of downgrades of investment-grade securities to below investment grade. These downgrades and the reduction in invested assets due to the reinsurance agreement with Commonwealth contributed to the increase in our holdings of below-investment-grade securities as a percentage of our total investments from 5.8 percent at December 31, 2019 to 6.7 percent at December 31, 2020 on a fair value basis.\nWe continue to monitor capital market activity on a regular basis and to the extent that there is continued volatility and ratings downgrades related to the issuers of our fixed maturity securities, we could experience further credit losses, an increase in defaults, and the need for additional capital in our insurance subsidiaries. However, we remain confident in the overall strength and credit quality of our investment portfolio. Net investment income may decline as a result of the current economic conditions, as the sustained low interest rate environment will continue to impact the yield on our invested assets, particularly related to the investment of new cash flows. For further discussion, see \"Fixed Maturity Securities\" contained herein in this Item 7.\nImprovements in the net asset values (NAV) of our partnership investments in the fourth quarter of 2020, which reflect the market conditions of the third quarter of 2020, resulted in net investment income of $29.4 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, U.S. equity and credit markets continued to improve from the severe decline experienced during the first quarter of 2020 due to COVID-19, and although our partnership investments are not directly correlated with those markets, their results were positively impacted and have driven higher asset fair values. In addition to our partnership investment activity, the current economic conditions and sustained low interest rate environment have and will continue to impact the yield on our invested assets, particularly related to the investment of new cash flows. We have also worked with certain of our commercial mortgage\nloan borrowers that have requested temporary payment deferrals, but this has not resulted in a significant number of loans with deferrals or a significant impact on our net investment income. For further discussion, see \"Mortgage Loans\" and \"Private Equity Partnerships\" contained herein in this Item 7. See \"Executive Summary\" for further information on the impact from COVID-19 contained herein in this Item 7.\nFixed Maturity Securities\nThe fair values and associated unrealized gains and losses of our fixed maturity securities portfolio, by industry classification, are as follows:\nFixed Maturity Securities - By Industry Classification\nAs of December 31, 2020\nThe following two tables show the length of time our investment-grade and below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities have been in a gross unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2020 and at the end of the prior four quarters. The relationships of the current fair value to amortized cost are not necessarily indicative of the fair value to amortized cost relationships for the securities throughout the entire time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position nor are they necessarily indicative of the relationships after December 31, 2020. The decrease in the unrealized loss on fixed maturity securities during 2020 was due primarily to a decrease in U.S. Treasury rates.\nUnrealized Loss on Investment-Grade Fixed Maturity Securities\nLength of Time in Unrealized Loss Position\nUnrealized Loss on Below-Investment-Grade Fixed Maturity Securities\nLength of Time in Unrealized Loss Position\nAt December 31, 2020, we held no fixed maturity securities with a gross unrealized loss greater than $10.0 million.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we recognized the following credit losses greater than $10 million:\n\u2022$20.8 million on fixed maturity securities issued by an oil and gas producer. The profitability of the company has been impacted by the decline in oil prices. Given the current environment, near term debt maturities may be difficult to refinance. We changed our intent to hold this security in the second quarter of 2020 and recognized a $1.4 million loss on the sale of the security in addition to the credit loss previously recorded.\n\u2022$17.1 million on fixed maturity securities issued by an oil and gas producer. The profitability of the company has been impacted by the decline in oil prices and the company has a high level of debt. The company filed for bankruptcy as expected in early April 2020. We changed our intent to hold this security in the third quarter of 2020 and recognized a $1.0 million loss on the sale of the security in addition to the credit loss previously recorded.\n\u2022$10.2 million on fixed maturity securities issued by a paper company whose sales of lumber and other products have been impacted by the slowdown in the economy. As a result of an improvement in lumber and other products, during\nthe fourth quarter of 2020, we reversed the remainder of the allowance for credit losses that we had recognized in the previous quarters of 2020.\nDuring the remainder of 2020, we did not experience any credit losses exceeding $10 million.\nWe had one individual realized investment loss of $20.8 million from impairments during 2019. We had no individual realized investment losses of $10.0 million or greater from impairments during 2018. We had no individual realized investment losses of $10.0 million or greater from sales of fixed maturity securities during 2020. We had one individual realized investment loss of $15.6 million from the sale of fixed maturity securities during 2019, and we had no individual realized investment losses of $10.0 million or greater from the sale of fixed maturity securities during 2018.\nAt December 31, 2020, our mortgage/asset-backed securities had an average life of 3.8 years, effective duration of 2.7 years, and a weighted average credit rating of AAA. The mortgage/asset-backed securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities as well as independent pricing services. One of the risks involved in investing in mortgage/asset-backed securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal with the possibility of reinvesting the funds in a lower interest rate environment. We use models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates. The timing of prepayment cash flows may also cause volatility in our recognition of investment income. We recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities. Actual prepayment experience is reviewed periodically, and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual prepayments received and currently projected. The effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis, and the adjustment is reflected in net investment income.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the amortized cost net of allowance for credit losses and fair value of our below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities was $3,256.0 million and $3,500.1 million, respectively. Below-investment-grade securities are inherently riskier than investment-grade securities since the risk of default by the issuer, by definition and as exhibited by bond rating, is higher. Also, the secondary market for certain below-investment-grade issues can be highly illiquid. Additional downgrades may occur, but we do not anticipate any liquidity problems resulting from our investments in below-investment-grade securities, nor do we expect these investments to adversely affect our ability to hold our other investments to maturity.\nFixed Maturity Securities - Energy Sector\nOur investment portfolio has exposure to companies whose businesses are negatively impacted by lower oil and natural gas prices. These include exploration and production companies, refineries, midstream pipeline companies, and oilfield service businesses. The sharp decline in energy prices and decrease in demand due to COVID-19, which began to occur in the first quarter of 2020, put pressure on the earnings and cash flows of these businesses. Oil prices did improve during the remainder of 2020; however, we continue to monitor this sector closely. The degree to which a business is affected by energy prices can vary greatly depending on, among other things, its energy subsector, geographic locations, cost structure flexibility, capital structure, and hedging policies.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately 51 percent of our exposure to the energy sector was represented by the midstream (pipeline) subsector which tends to be more correlated to product volume sales than to commodity prices. Approximately 24 percent of our exposure is in the oil and gas independent exploration and production subsector where underlying profitability is highly correlated with oil and gas prices. Approximately 16 percent of our exposure is in the integrated subsector which is comprised of large highly rated companies. The majority of our energy sector holdings are investment-grade fixed maturity securities.\nAt December 31, 2020, the fair value of investment-grade fixed maturity securities in the energy sector was $3,112.2 million, with a gross unrealized gain of $571.3 million and a gross unrealized loss of $0.1 million. The fair value of below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities in the energy sector was $626.3 million, with a gross unrealized gain of $33.4 million and a gross unrealized loss of $13.5 million. The following table shows additional information related to our holdings in the energy sector.\nFixed Maturity Securities - Foreign Exposure\nOur investments in issuers in foreign countries are chosen for specific portfolio management purposes, including asset and liability management and portfolio diversification across geographic lines and sectors to minimize non-market risks. In our approach to investing in fixed maturity securities, specific investments within approved countries and industry sectors are evaluated for their market position and specific strengths and potential weaknesses. For each security, we consider the political, legal, and financial environment of the sovereign entity in which an issuer is domiciled and operates. The country of domicile is based on consideration of the issuer's headquarters, in addition to location of the assets and the country in which the majority of sales and earnings are derived. We do not have exposure to foreign currency risk, as the cash flows from these investments are either denominated in currencies or hedged into currencies to match the related liabilities. We continually evaluate our foreign investment risk exposure.\nMortgage Loans\nThe carrying value of our mortgage loan portfolio was $2,432.1 million and $2,397.0 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our investments in mortgage loans are carried at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses. Our mortgage loan portfolio is comprised entirely of commercial mortgage loans. Our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified geographically and among property types. Due to conservative underwriting, the incidence of problem mortgage loans and foreclosure activity continues to be low. We held no impaired mortgage loans at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted a new accounting standard requiring the estimation of an allowance for expected credit losses which was $13.1 million at December 31, 2020. See Notes 1 and 3 in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our mortgage loan portfolio and the allowance for expected credit losses.\nPrivate Equity Partnerships\nThe carrying value of our investments in private equity partnerships was $747.5 million and $616.7 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. These partnerships are passive in nature and represent funds that are primarily invested in private credit, private equity, and real assets. The carrying value of the partnerships is based on our share of the partnership's NAV and changes in the carrying value are recorded as a component of net investment income. We receive financial information related to our investments in partnerships and generally record investment income on a one-quarter lag in accordance with our accounting policy. We recorded net investment income totaling $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 for the partnerships, which included net investment income of $29.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020\nreflecting the improved market conditions of the third quarter of 2020. The majority of our investments in partnerships are not redeemable. Distributions received from the funds arise from income generated by the underlying investments as well as the liquidation of the underlying investments. There is generally not a public market for these investments. We had $590.7 million of commitments for additional investments in the partnerships at December 31, 2020 which may or may not be funded. See Note 2 in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our private equity partnerships.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage reinvestment, duration, foreign currency, and credit risks. Historically, we have utilized current and forward interest rate swaps and options on forward interest rate swaps and U.S. Treasury rates, current and forward currency swaps, forward treasury locks, currency forward contracts, forward contracts on specific fixed income securities, and credit default swaps. Credit exposure on derivatives is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position, including accrued interest receivable less collateral held. At December 31, 2020, we had no credit exposure on derivatives. We held $8.7 million of cash collateral from our counterparties at December 31, 2020. The carrying value of fixed maturity securities posted as collateral to our counterparties was $54.0 million at December 31, 2020. We had no cash collateral posted to our counterparties at December 31, 2020. We believe that our credit risk is mitigated by our use of multiple counterparties, all of which have an investment-grade credit rating, and by our use of cross-collateralization agreements.\nOther\nIn 2020, we recognized impairment losses totaling $36.6 million on real estate held for investment.\nOur exposure to non-current investments, defined as foreclosed real estate and invested assets which are delinquent as to interest and/or principal payments, totaled $16.6 million and $30.5 million on a fair value basis at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSee Notes 3 and 4 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our investments and our derivative financial instruments.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations, principally in our insurance subsidiaries. Premium and investment income, as well as maturities and sales of invested assets, provide the primary sources of cash. Debt and/or securities offerings provide additional sources of liquidity. Cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits, costs of acquiring new business (principally commissions), operating expenses, and taxes, as well as purchases of new investments.\nWe have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations. We attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business. However, deterioration in the credit market may delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner and adversely impact the price we receive for such securities, which may negatively impact our cash flows. Furthermore, if we experience defaults on securities held in the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries, this will negatively impact statutory capital, which could reduce our insurance subsidiaries' capacity to pay dividends to our holding companies. A reduction in dividends to our holding companies could force us to seek external financing to avoid impairing our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or meet our debt and other payment obligations.\nOur policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments, and we have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities. A decrease in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations. However, our historical pattern of benefits paid to revenues is generally consistent, even during cycles of economic downturns, which serves to minimize liquidity risk.\nThe liquidity requirements of the holding company Unum Group include common stock dividends, interest and debt service, and ongoing investments in our businesses. Unum Group's liquidity requirements are met by assets held by Unum Group and our intermediate holding companies, dividends from primarily our insurance subsidiaries, and issuance of common stock, debt, or\nother capital securities and borrowings from existing credit facilities, as needed. As of December 31, 2020, Unum Group and our intermediate holding companies had available holding company liquidity of $1,512 million that was held primarily in bank deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, corporate bonds, and asset backed securities. No significant restrictions exist on our ability to use or access funds in any of our U.S. or foreign intermediate holding companies. Dividends repatriated from our foreign subsidiaries are eligible for 100 percent exemption from U.S. income tax but may be subject to withholding tax and/or tax on foreign currency gain or loss. See \"Closed Block Individual Disability Reinsurance Agreement\" and \"Cash Available from Subsidiaries\" below for further discussion regarding the Northwind assets.\nAs part of our capital deployment strategy, we repurchase shares of Unum Group's common stock, as authorized by our board of directors. In the second quarter of 2019, the board authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of common stock through November 2020, at which point the authorization expired. We did not repurchase any shares during 2020 and as of December 31, 2020, we had not authorized a new share repurchase program. See Note 10 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8.\nLiquidity and Capital Resource Considerations - COVID-19\nWe have strengthened our liquidity position through actions such as maintaining a higher level of short-term investments and posting additional collateral from certain of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries to the regional FHLBs. As a result, we believe we have the appropriate liquidity and access to capital to avoid significant disruption to our operations. We have not yet experienced a significant impact to our liquidity as a result of the collection of premiums and submitted claims activity; however, we continually monitor the development of these items.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have borrowed $312.2 million of funds through our memberships with the regional FHLBs and similar to our previous advances, these funds are used for the purpose of investing in either short-term investments or fixed maturity securities. Although we did increase FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2020, we have additional borrowing capacity of approximately $1,093 million that can be utilized for liquidity if the need arises. Additionally, we have access to two unsecured revolving credit facilities under separate syndicates of lenders that allow us to borrow up to a total of $600 million. There are currently no outstanding borrowings on these facilities but we remain in compliance with required covenants should we choose to borrow in the future. During 2020, we also issued $500.0 million of 4.500% senior notes due 2025 which strengthened our liquidity and demonstrated our ability to raise capital in a strained economic environment.\nFollowing the maturity of our $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% unsecured notes in the third quarter of 2020, which was funded through an issuance of debt during the second quarter of 2019, we have no significant upcoming debt maturities until 2024. We continue to meet the financial covenants contained in our current debt agreements and credit facilities, and we expect that we will continue to meet those covenants in subsequent periods.\nTo the extent that we begin to experience a significant impact to our liquidity, we would likely sell highly liquid invested assets or borrow funds on our credit facilities to meet operational cash flow requirements.\nSee \"Debt\" and \"Transfers of Financial Assets\" for further discussion of our debt arrangements, credit facilities, and of our FHLB arrangements contained herein in this Item 7. For further discussion of the key considerations regarding the impacts of COVID-19 see \"Executive Summary\" herein in this Item 7.\nClosed Block Individual Disability Reinsurance Agreement\nIn December 2020, Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company, The Paul Revere Life Insurance Company, and Unum Life Insurance Company of America (Unum America), wholly-owned domestic insurance subsidiaries of Unum Group and collectively referred to as \"the ceding companies\", entered into a series of agreements (collectively referred to as the \"reinsurance agreement\") with Commonwealth to reinsure effective as of July 1, 2020, approximately 75 percent of the Closed Block individual disability insurance business, primarily direct business written by the ceding companies. Commonwealth has established and will maintain collateralized trust accounts for the benefit of the ceding companies to secure its obligations under the reinsurance agreement. As part of the agreement, additional Closed Block individual disability business consisting of direct business not ceded in December 2020 and business assumed by the ceding companies from third parties, is expected to be reinsured in the first quarter of 2021, subject to receipt of required consents and regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions and is considered the second phase of this transaction.\nAlso in December 2020, prior to entering into this agreement with Commonwealth, the ceding companies recaptured their respective reinsurance agreements with Northwind Reinsurance Company (Northwind Re) where substantially all of the ceding\ncompanies' closed block individual disability business had previously been fully ceded to Northwind Re, an affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiary domiciled in the United States, with Unum Group as the ultimate parent.\nIn connection with the first phase of the reinsurance agreement that closed in December 2020, the ceding companies paid a total cash ceding commission to Commonwealth of approximately $438 million and transferred additional assets consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities and cash totaling $6,669.8 million. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we released approximately $400 million of capital as a result of the reinsurance agreement and we expect to release approximately $250 million of additional capital in the first quarter of 2021 assuming the second phase of the transaction is fully executed, which is dependent on the receipt of required consents and regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions.\nSee \"Reinsurance\" contained herein in Item 1; \"Segment Results,\" contained herein in Item 7, and Notes 12 and 16 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion on the impacts related to this reinsurance agreement.\nCash Available from Subsidiaries\nUnum Group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries depend on payments from subsidiaries to pay dividends to stockholders, to pay debt obligations, and/or to pay expenses. These payments by our insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, operating and investment management fees, and/or interest payments on loans from the parent to a subsidiary.\nRestrictions under applicable state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries in any 12-month period without prior approval by regulatory authorities. For life insurance companies domiciled in the U.S., that limitation generally equals, depending on the state of domicile, either ten percent of an insurer's statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the statutory net gain from operations, excluding realized investment gains and losses, of the preceding year. The payment of dividends to a parent company from a life insurance subsidiary is generally further limited to the amount of unassigned funds.\nUnum America cedes blocks of business to Fairwind Insurance Company (Fairwind), which is an affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiary domiciled in the United States. The ability of Fairwind to pay dividends to Unum Group will depend on its satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and on the performance of the business reinsured by Fairwind. We do not anticipate that Fairwind will pay dividends in 2021. As previously discussed, due to the recapture of the reinsurance agreements with Northwind Re, as of December 31, 2020, no insurance risk remains in Northwind Re and therefore Fairwind remains the only active reinsurance captive.\nThe ability of Unum Group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries to continue to receive dividends from their insurance subsidiaries also depends on additional factors such as RBC ratios and capital adequacy and/or solvency requirements, funding growth objectives at an affiliate level, and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support desired ratings. The RBC ratios for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2020 are in line with our expectations and are significantly above the level that would require state regulatory action.\nIn connection with a financial examination of Unum Life Insurance Company of America, which closed at the end of the second quarter of 2020, the Maine Bureau of Insurance (MBOI) concluded that Unum America\u2019s long-term care statutory reserves are deficient by $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2018, the financial statement date of the examination period. The MBOI granted permission to Unum America on May 1, 2020, to phase in the additional statutory reserves over seven years beginning with year-end 2020 and ending with year-end 2026. The 2020 phase-in amount was approximately $229 million and was funded using cash flows from operations. This strengthening will be incorporated by using explicitly agreed upon margins into our existing assumptions for annual statutory reserve adequacy testing. These actions will add margin to Unum America's best estimate assumptions. Our long-term care reserves and financial results reported under generally accepted accounting principles are not affected by the MBOI\u2019s examination conclusion. We plan to fund the additional statutory reserves with expected cash flows.\nUnum Group and/or certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries may also receive dividends from our U.K. subsidiaries, the payment of which may be subject to applicable insurance company regulations and capital guidance in the U.K. Unum Limited is subject to the requirements of Solvency II, an European Union (EU) directive, which prescribes capital requirements and risk management standards for the European insurance industry. Our European holding company is also subject to the Solvency II requirements relevant to insurance holding companies, while its subsidiaries (the Unum European Economic Area (EEA) Group), which includes Unum Limited, are subject to group supervision under Solvency II. The Unum EEA Group received approval from the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority to use its own internal model for calculating\nregulatory capital and also received approval for certain associated regulatory permissions including transitional relief as the Solvency II capital regime continues to be implemented. In connection with the recent exit from the EU, the U.K. government is reviewing the regulatory framework of financial services companies which may result in changes to U.K. regulatory capital or U.K. tax regulations. Recent economic conditions contributed to volatility in our solvency ratios used to monitor capital adequacy.\nThe payment of dividends to the parent company from our subsidiaries also requires the approval of the individual subsidiary's board of directors.\nThe amount available during 2020 for the payment of ordinary dividends from Unum Group's traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, which excludes our captive reinsurers, was approximately $1,035 million, of which $831.5 million was declared and paid. The amount available during 2020 from Unum Limited was approximately \u00a3180 million, of which \u00a330.0 million was declared and paid to Unum Group through one of our U.K. holding companies. During 2020, Northwind Re paid dividends of $58.4 million to Northwind Holdings. Fairwind paid no dividends during 2020.\nDuring 2021, we intend to maintain a level of capital in our insurance subsidiaries above the applicable capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins. As a result of our consideration of overall capitalization needs, we may not utilize the entire amount of dividends available in 2021, which are based on applicable restrictions under current law. Approximately $974 million is available, without prior approval by regulatory authorities, during 2021 for the payment of dividends from Unum Group's traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, which excludes our captive reinsurers. Approximately \u00a3170 million is considered distributable from Unum Limited during 2021, subject to local solvency standards and regulatory approval.\nInsurance regulatory restrictions do not limit the amount of dividends available for distribution from non-insurance subsidiaries except where the non-insurance subsidiaries are held directly or indirectly by an insurance subsidiary and only indirectly by Unum Group, which does not apply to our current entity structure.\nFunding for Employee Benefit Plans\nWe made contributions of $66.4 million and \u00a33.7 million to our U.S. and U.K. defined contribution plans, respectively, in 2020 and expect to make contributions of approximately $67 million and \u00a33.8 million during 2021. We made a de minimis amount of contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and no contribution to our U.K. defined benefit pension plan during 2020. We do not expect to make any contributions to either plan during 2021. We have met all minimum pension funding requirements set forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. We have estimated our future funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and under applicable U.K. law and do not believe that any future funding requirements will cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity. See Note 9 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our employee benefit plans.\nDebt\nThere are no significant financial covenants associated with any of our outstanding debt obligations. We continually monitor our debt covenants to ensure we remain in compliance. We have not observed any current trends that would cause a breach of any debt covenants.\nMaturities, Purchases, and Retirement of Debt\nNorthwind Holdings made periodic principal payments on the Northwind notes of $45.0 million in 2020 and $60.0 million in both 2019 and 2018. In December 2020, Northwind Holdings redeemed the remaining $35.0 million of principal on the Northwind notes, and was released of any contractual collateral requirements.\nIn September 2020, our $400.0 million 5.625% senior unsecured notes matured.\nDuring 2019 we purchased and retired (i) $22.8 million aggregate liquidation amount of our 7.405% capital securities due 2038; (ii) $30.3 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.190% medium-term notes due 2028; (iii) $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.250% senior notes due 2028; and (iv) $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.000% senior notes due 2021.\nIn 2018, our $200.0 million 7.000% senior unsecured notes matured.\nIssuance of Debt\nIn May 2020, we issued $500.0 million of 4.500% senior notes due 2025. The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.\nIn September 2019, we issued $450.0 million of 4.500% senior notes due 2049. The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.\nIn June 2019, we issued $400.0 million of 4.000% senior notes due 2029. The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.\nIn 2018, we issued $300.0 million of 6.25% junior subordinated notes due 2058. The notes are redeemable at or above par on or after June 15, 2023 and rank equally in the right of payment with our other junior subordinated debt securities.\nCredit Facilities\nWe have access to two separate unsecured revolving credit facilities, each with a different syndicate of lenders. One of our credit facilities is under a five-year agreement and is effective through April 2024. The terms of this agreement provide for a borrowing capacity of $500.0 million with an option to be increased up to $700.0 million. We may also request, on up to two occasions, that the lenders' commitment termination dates be extended by one year. The credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit subject to certain terms and limitations. At December 31, 2020, letters of credit totaling $0.6 million had been issued from this credit facility, but there were no borrowed amounts outstanding.\nOur other credit facility is under a three-year agreement and is effective until April 2022. The terms of this agreement provide for a borrowing capacity of $100.0 million with an option to be increased up to $140.0 million. We may also request that the lenders' commitment termination dates be extended by one year. The credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit subject to certain terms and limitations. At December 31, 2020, there have been no letters of credit issued from the credit facility and there were no borrowed amounts outstanding.\nBorrowings under the credit facilities are for general corporate uses and are subject to financial covenants, negative covenants, and events of default that are customary. The two primary financial covenants include limitations based on our leverage ratio and consolidated net worth. We are also subject to covenants that limit subsidiary indebtedness. The credit facilities provide for borrowings at an interest rate based either on the prime rate or LIBOR.\nSee Note 8 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for additional information on our debt.\nShelf Registration\nWe filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2020 to issue various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares, stock purchase contracts, units and warrants. The shelf registration enables us to raise funds from the offering of any securities covered by the shelf registration as well as any combination thereof, subject to market conditions and our capital needs.\nCommitments\nThe following table summarizes contractual obligations and our reinsurance recoverable by period as of December 31, 2020:\nLong-term debt includes contractual principal and interest payments and therefore exceeds the amount shown in the consolidated balance sheets.\nPolicyholder liability maturities and the related reinsurance recoverable represent the projected payout of the current in-force policyholder liabilities and the expected cash inflows from reinsurers for liabilities ceded and therefore incorporate uncertainties as to the timing and amount of claim payments. We utilize extensive liability modeling to project future cash flows from the in-force business. The primary assumptions used to project future cash flows are claim incidence rates for mortality and morbidity, claim resolution rates, persistency rates, and interest rates. These cash flows are discounted to determine the current value of the projected claim payments. The timing and amount of payments on policyholder liabilities may vary significantly from the projections above.\nPensions and OPEB commitments relate to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans for our employees, including our non-qualified pension plan. Pension plan obligations, other than the non-qualified plan, represent our contributions to the pension plans and are projected based on the expected future minimum contributions as required under current U.S. and U.K. legislative funding requirements. Non-qualified pension plan and other postretirement benefit obligations represent the expected benefit payments related to these plans which we expect to pay, as incurred, from our general assets.\nMiscellaneous liabilities include commissions due and accrued, deferred compensation liabilities, contingent considerations, state premium taxes payable, amounts due to reinsurance companies, legally binding commitments to fund investments, obligations to return unrestricted cash collateral to our securities lending and derivative counterparties, advances received from the FHLB, and various other liabilities that represent contractual obligations. Obligations where the timing of the payment is uncertain are included in the one year or less category.\nSee \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" contained herein in this Item 7 and Notes 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, and 15 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for additional information on our various commitments and obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPurchase obligations include commitments of $624.0 million to fund certain of our investments. These are included in the preceding table based on the expiration date of the commitments. The funds are due upon satisfaction of contractual notice from appropriate external parties and may or may not be funded. Also included are obligations with outside parties for computer data processing services, software maintenance agreements, and consulting services. The aggregate obligation remaining under these agreements was $104.5 million at December 31, 2020.\nAs part of our regular investing strategy, we receive collateral from unaffiliated third parties through transactions which include both securities lending and short-term agreements to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them at a later specified date. For both types of transactions, we require that a minimum of 102 percent of the fair value of the securities loaned or securities purchased under repurchase agreements be maintained as collateral. Generally, cash is received as collateral under these agreements. In the event that securities are received as collateral, we are not permitted to sell or re-post them. We also post our fixed maturity securities as collateral to unaffiliated third parties through transactions including both securities lending and short-term agreements to sell securities with the agreement to repurchase them at a later specified date. See \"Transfers of Financial Assets\" as follows for further discussion.\nTo help limit the credit exposure of derivatives, we enter into master netting agreements with our counterparties whereby contracts in a gain position can be offset against contracts in a loss position. We also typically enter into bilateral, cross-collateralization agreements with our counterparties to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives. These agreements require the counterparty in a loss position to submit acceptable collateral with the other counterparty in the event the net loss position meets or exceeds an agreed upon amount. Credit exposure on derivatives is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position, including accrued interest receivable less collateral held. At December 31, 2020, we had $0.7 million credit exposure on derivatives. We held cash collateral from our counterparties of $8.7 million at December 31, 2020 and had posted fixed maturity securities with a carrying value of $54.0 million as collateral to our counterparties.\nSee Notes 3 and 4 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for additional information.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nOur investment policy permits us to lend fixed maturity securities to unaffiliated financial institutions in short-term securities lending agreements, which increases our investment income with minimal risk. We account for all of our securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements as secured borrowings. As of December 31, 2020, we held $17.6 million of cash collateral from securities lending agreements. The average balance for securities lending agreements which were collateralized by cash during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3.6 million, and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was $17.6 million. In addition, at December 31, 2020, we had $82.8 million of off-balance sheet securities lending agreements which were collateralized by securities that we were neither permitted to sell nor control. The average balance of these off-balance sheet transactions during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $56.8 million, and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was $234.3 million.\nTo manage our cash position more efficiently, we may enter into repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions. We generally use repurchase agreements as a means to finance the purchase of invested assets or for short-term general business purposes until projected cash flows become available from our operations or existing investments. We had no repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2020, nor did we utilize any repurchase agreements during 2020. Our use of repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements can fluctuate during any given period and will depend on our liquidity position, the availability of long-term investments that meet our purchasing criteria, and our general business needs.\nCertain of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are members of regional Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB). As of December 31, 2020, we owned $28.2 million of FHLB common stock and had outstanding advances of $312.2 million from the regional FHLBs.\nSee Note 3 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for additional information.\nConsolidated Cash Flows\nOperating Cash Flows\nOperating cash flows are primarily attributable to the receipt of premium and investment income, offset by payments of claims, commissions, expenses, and income taxes. Premium income growth is dependent not only on new sales, but on policy renewals and growth of existing business, renewal price increases, and persistency. Investment income growth is dependent on the growth in the underlying assets supporting our insurance reserves and capital and on the earned yield. The level of commissions and operating expenses is attributable to the level of sales and the first year acquisition expenses associated with new business as well as the maintenance of existing business. The level of paid claims is affected partially by the growth and aging of the block of business and also by the general economy, as previously discussed in the operating results by segment.\nThe variance in the change in insurance reserves and liabilities and net realized investment (gain) loss to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows for 2020 was due primarily to the 2020 Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction. Also included in operating cash flows for 2020 was $1,084.6 million of cash paid to the reinsurer in the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance agreement.\nThe variance in the change in insurance reserves and liabilities to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows for 2018 was due primarily to the 2018 reserve increase for our long-term care line of business.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nInvesting cash inflows consist primarily of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments. Investing cash outflows consist primarily of payments for purchases of investments. Our investment strategy is to match the cash flows and durations of our assets with the cash flows and durations of our liabilities to meet the funding requirements of our business. When market opportunities arise, we may sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds to improve the yield and credit quality of our portfolio. We may at times also sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities and/or re-balance our portfolio. As a result, sales before maturity may vary from period to period. The sale and purchase of short-term investments is influenced by proceeds received from FHLB funding advances, issuance of debt, our securities lending program, and by the amount of cash which is at times held in short-term investments to facilitate the availability of cash to fund the purchase of appropriate long-term investments, repay maturing debt, and/or to fund our capital deployment program. Our cash flows for 2018 include cash outflows, net of cash acquired, of $145.4 million related to all of our acquisitions during the year.\nSee Notes 3 and 13 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further information.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nFinancing cash flows consist primarily of borrowings and repayments of debt, repurchase of common stock, and dividends paid to stockholders.\nDuring 2020, our $400.0 million 5.625% senior unsecured notes matured and we repaid the remaining $80.0 million of principal on our senior secured non-recourse notes issued by Northwind Holdings. During 2019, we purchased and retired $433.1 million aggregate liquidation/principal amount of our outstanding capital and debt securities, including debt repurchase costs of $25.9 million for a total cash outflow of $459.0 million. During 2018, our $200.0 million 7.00% senior unsecured notes matured. During each of the years 2019 and 2018, we made principal payments of $60.0 million on the Northwind notes.\nDuring 2020, we issued $500.0 million of 4.50% senior notes due 2025 and received total proceeds of $494.1 million. During 2019, we issued $450.0 million of 4.50% senior notes due 2049 and $400.0 million of 4.00% senior notes due 2029 and received total proceeds of $841.9 million. During 2018, we issued $300.0 million of 6.25% junior subordinated notes due 2058 and received total proceeds of $290.7 million.\nCash used to repurchase shares of Unum Group's common stock during 2019 and 2018 was $400.3 million and $356.2 million, respectively. During 2020, 2019, and 2018 we paid dividends of $231.9 million, $229.2 million, and $215.6 million, respectively, to holders of Unum Group's common stock.\nIncluded in financing cash flows during 2020 was $62.1 million of cash received related to the ALR cohort volatility agreement with Commonwealth.\nSee \"Debt\" contained herein in this Item 7, and Notes 8, 10, and 12 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in Item 8 for further information.\nRatings\nAM Best, Fitch, Moody's, and S&P are among the third parties that assign issuer credit ratings to Unum Group and financial strength ratings to our insurance subsidiaries. We compete based in part on the financial strength ratings provided by rating agencies. A downgrade of our financial strength ratings can be expected to adversely affect us and could potentially, among other things, adversely affect our relationships with distributors of our products and services and retention of our sales force, negatively impact persistency and new sales, particularly large case group sales and individual sales, and generally adversely affect our ability to compete. A downgrade in the issuer credit rating assigned to Unum Group can be expected to adversely affect our cost of capital or our ability to raise additional capital.\nThe table below reflects the outlook as well as the issuer credit ratings for Unum Group and the financial strength ratings for each of our traditional insurance subsidiaries as of the date of this filing.\nNR = not rated\nWe maintain an ongoing dialogue with the four rating agencies that evaluate us in order to inform them of progress we are making regarding our strategic objectives and financial plans as well as other pertinent issues. A significant component of our communications involves our annual review meeting with each of the four agencies. We hold other meetings throughout the year regarding our business, including, but not limited to, quarterly updates.\nOn April 16, 2020, Fitch downgraded the financial strength rating on our rated domestic insurance subsidiaries from A to A- and the issuer credit rating on our senior debt obligations from BBB to BBB- due to ongoing concerns regarding our long-term care exposure and the adequacy of those reserves. In addition, Fitch also maintained a negative outlook following the downgrade due\nto concerns over the current COVID-19 pandemic and the impact it may have on our financial position and operating results, particularly as it relates to investment returns and claims incidence.\nOn May 4, 2020, Moody's downgraded the financial strength rating on our rated domestic insurance subsidiaries from A2 to A3 and the issuer credit rating on our senior debt obligations from Baa2 to Baa3 due to concerns around capital flexibility related to future funding requirements for our long-term care reserves. In addition, Moody's updated their outlook from stable to negative due to concerns over the current COVID-19 pandemic and the impact it may have on our financial position and operating results.\nAlso on May 4, 2020, S&P affirmed their ratings and outlook on our rated insurance subsidiaries and issuer credit ratings on our senior debt obligations.\nOn May 27, 2020, AM Best revised their outlook from stable to negative while affirming both the financial strength ratings on our domestic insurance subsidiaries and the long-term issuer ratings on our senior debt obligations. The negative outlook reflects concerns related to future capital contributions required to support our long-term care reserves as well as the impacts from current economic conditions on our operating results and investment portfolio.\nThere have been no other changes in the rating agencies' outlooks or ratings during 2020 or in 2021 prior to the date of this filling.\nAgency ratings are not directed toward the holders of our securities and are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be regarded as an independent assessment, not conditional on any other rating. Given the dynamic nature of the ratings process, changes by these or other rating agencies may or may not occur in the near-term. We have ongoing dialogue with the rating agencies concerning our insurance risk profile, our financial flexibility, our operating performance, and the quality of our investment portfolios. The rating agencies provide specific criteria and, depending on our performance relative to the criteria, will determine future negative or positive rating agency actions.\nSee \"Ratings\" contained herein in Item 1 and \"Risk Factors\" contained herein in Item 1A for further discussion.",

    "item_8": "ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Unum Group\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Unum Group and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 17, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nReserves for Long Term Care Policy and Contract Benefits\nDescription of the Matter The Company\u2019s reserves for individual and group long-term care policy and contract benefits are $12.8 billion of the $49.7 billion of Reserves for Future Policy and Contract Benefits on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The two primary categories of long-term care reserves are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported. Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements describe the accounting for these reserves.\nPolicy reserves are established based on a gross premium valuation method to estimate the difference between projected future policy benefits and future premiums utilizing assumptions established as of the most recent loss recognition. Claim reserves are established based on a tabular reserve methodology representing assumptions reflecting the best estimate of the present value of the liability for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. Management is required to evaluate its long-term care reserves each period to determine if a reserve deficiency exists. There is significant uncertainty in estimating long-term care reserves given the extended period over which claims are paid and sensitivity of the estimate to assumptions, including morbidity, mortality, claims incidence and resolutions, persistency, interest rates, and future premium rate increases. In connection with the annual review of long-term care policy and claim reserve adequacy, the Company increased its long-term care policy and claim reserves by $151.5 million as of December 31, 2020.\nAuditing the long-term care policy and contract benefits reserves was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the significant assumptions including morbidity, mortality, claims incidence and resolutions, persistency, interest rates and future premium rate increases used in the measurement process. The significant judgment and the sensitivity of the estimate to these assumptions can have a material effect on the valuation of the liability.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal controls over the long-term care reserves process, including controls over the review and approval of assumptions which incorporate the Company\u2019s most recent experience.\nTo test long-term care policy and contract benefits liability we performed audit procedures, with the assistance of our actuarial specialists, that included, among others, an evaluation of the methodologies applied by management\u2019s actuarial specialists with those methods used in prior periods. We evaluated the significant assumptions used by management in determining the policy and claims reserves by comparing the significant assumptions, including expected morbidity, mortality, claims incidence and resolutions, persistency, interest rates, and future premium rate increases to historical assumptions, prior actual experience, policyholder experience studies performed by management, available industry information, observable market data, or management\u2019s estimates of prospective changes in these assumptions. In addition, we performed a review of the historical results of the development of the estimate, assessed management\u2019s annual reserve adequacy test, evaluated the reasonableness of the additional reserves resulting from the reserve adequacy test, and performed an independent recalculation of policy and contract benefit reserves for a sample of contracts which we compared to the actuarial model used by management.\nAccounting for Reinsurance of Closed Block Individual Disability Insurance\nDescription of the Matter As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, in December 2020, the Company entered into a series of agreements (collectively referred to as the \"reinsurance agreement\") to reinsure a substantial portion of the closed block individual disability insurance business (IDI Closed Block) to Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company (Commonwealth) with a reinsurance effective date of July 1, 2020. The Company ceded $6.1 billion of disabled life reserves on a coinsurance basis along with transferring $6.7 billion of fixed maturity securities and cash supporting the reserves and payment of a $438 million ceding commission to Commonwealth. In addition, the Company provided a 12-year volatility cover for the active life reserve cohort of the IDI Closed Block in exchange for a payment of $62 million from Commonwealth. The transfer of the disabled life reserves were accounted for as reinsurance and the active life cohort was accounted for using the deposit method. The Company recorded a cost of reinsurance asset of $815.7 million for this transaction that will be amortized over the remaining life of the IDI Closed Block.\nAuditing the reinsurance of the closed block individual disability insurance was complex due to multiple elements of the transaction including the assessment of risk transfer, determination of the cost of reinsurance asset, accounting for transfers of assets and liabilities and recording of the reinsurance recoverable amounts.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the reinsurance agreement process including, among others, controls related to whether the agreement passes risk transfer, the determination of the cost of reinsurance, and the accounting for transfers of assets and liabilities and recording of the reinsurance recoverable amounts.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, assessing the terms of the reinsurance agreement with Commonwealth, evaluating management\u2019s risk transfer conclusion, testing the calculation of the cost of reinsurance and the recognized investments gains and benefit expense amounts, and testing the reinsurance recoverable recorded.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1999.\nChattanooga, Tennessee\nFebruary 17, 2021\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation: The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Unum Group and its subsidiaries (the Company) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Such accounting principles differ from statutory accounting principles (see Note 16). Intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nDescription of Business: We are a leading provider of financial protection benefits in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland. Our products include disability, life, accident, critical illness, dental and vision, and other related services. We market our products primarily through the workplace.\nWe have three principal operating business segments: Unum US, Unum International, and Colonial Life. Our other reporting segments are Closed Block and Corporate. See Note 13 for further discussion of our operating segments.\nUse of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein.\nFixed Maturity Securities: Fixed maturity securities include long-term bonds and redeemable preferred stocks. Our fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, except for amounts related to impairment and credit losses recognized in earnings, are reported as a component of other comprehensive income. These amounts are net of income tax and valuation adjustments to deferred acquisition costs and reserves for future policy and contract benefits which would have been recorded had the related unrealized gain or loss on these securities been realized.\nInterest income is recorded as part of net investment income when earned, using an effective yield method giving effect to amortization of premium and accretion of discount. Included within fixed maturity securities are mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. We recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities. Actual prepayment experience is reviewed periodically, and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual prepayments received and currently projected. The effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis, and the adjustment is reflected in net investment income. For fixed maturity securities on which collection of investment income is uncertain, we discontinue the accrual of investment income and recognize investment income when interest and dividends are received. Payment terms specified for fixed maturity securities may include a prepayment penalty for unscheduled payoff of the investment. Prepayment penalties are recognized as investment income when received.\nIn determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is a credit loss, we evaluate available information, both positive and negative, in reaching our conclusions. In particular, we consider the strength of the issuer's balance sheet, its debt obligations and near-term funding requirements, cash flow and liquidity, the profitability of its core businesses, the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity, its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment, and its access to capital markets. Although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis, our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security, whether we intend to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether impairments represent credit losses. The significance of the decline in value is also an important factor, but we generally do not record an impairment loss based solely on this factor, since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a security.\nFor securities with a decline in fair value below amortized costs which we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery in value, the amortized cost of the investment is written down to fair value through earnings, and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period. For securities that we believe are impaired and which we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery in value, we calculate an allowance for credit losses recognized in earnings which generally represents the difference between the amortized cost of the security and the present value of our best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition and limited by the difference between amortized cost and fair value of the security. For fixed maturity securities for which we have recognized an allowance for credit loss through earnings, if through subsequent evaluation there is a significant increase in expected cash flows, the allowance is reduced and is recognized as a reduction to credit losses in the current period. See Notes 2 and 3.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nMortgage Loans: Mortgage loans are generally held for investment and are carried at amortized cost less an allowance for expected credit losses. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loan's contractual interest rate. Prepayment penalties are recognized as investment income when received. For mortgage loans on which collection of interest income is uncertain, we discontinue the accrual of interest and recognize it in the period when an interest payment is received. We typically do not resume the accrual of interest on mortgage loans on nonaccrual status until there are significant improvements in the underlying financial condition of the borrower. We consider a loan to be delinquent if full payment is not received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan.\nWe evaluate each of our mortgage loans individually for impairment and assign an internal credit quality rating based on a comprehensive rating system used to evaluate the credit risk of the loan. Although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis, loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios are the most critical factors in determining impairment. We estimate an allowance for credit losses that we expect to incur over the life of our mortgage loans using a probability of default method. For each loan, we estimate the probability that the loan will default before its maturity (probability of default) and the amount of the loss if the loan defaults (loss given default). These two factors result in an expected loss percentage that is applied to the amortized cost of each loan to determine the expected credit loss. As we are the original underwriter of the mortgage loans, the amortized cost generally equals the principal amount of the loan. We measure losses on defaults of our mortgage loans as the excess amortized cost of the mortgage loan over the fair value of the underlying collateral in the event that we foreclose on the loan or over the expected future cash flows of the loan if we retain the mortgage loan until payoff. We do not purchase mortgage loans with existing credit impairments.\nIn estimating the probability of default, we consider historical experience, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future market conditions. We utilize our historical loan experience in combination with a large third-party industry database for a period of time that aligns with the average life of our loans based on the maturity dates of the loans and prepayment experience. Our model utilizes an industry database of the historical loss experience based on our actual portfolio characteristics such as loan-to-value, debt service coverage, collateral type, geography, and late payment history. In addition, because we actively manage our portfolio, we may extend the term of a loan in certain situations and will accordingly extend the maturity date in the estimate of probability of default. In estimating the loss given default, we primarily consider the type and value of collateral and secondarily the expected liquidation costs and time to recovery.\nThe primary market factors that we consider in our forecast of future market conditions are gross domestic product, unemployment rates, interest rates, inflation, commercial real estate values, household formation, and retail sales. We also forecast certain loan specific factors such as growth in the fair value and net operating income of collateral by property type. We include our estimate of these factors over a two-year period and for the remainder of the loans\u2019 estimated lives, adjusted for estimated prepayments. Past the two-year forecast period, we revert to the historical assumptions ratably by the end of the fifth year of the loan after which we utilize only historical assumptions.\nWe utilize various scenarios to estimate our allowance for expected losses ranging from a base case scenario that reflects normal market conditions to a severe case scenario that reflects adverse market conditions. We will adjust our allowance each period to utilize the scenario or weighting of the scenarios that best reflects our view of current market conditions. Additions and reductions to our allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans are reported as a component of net realized investment gains and losses. See Note 3.\nPolicy Loans: Policy loans are presented at unpaid balances directly related to policyholders. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loan's contractual interest rate. Included in policy loans are $3,390.6 million and $3,490.6 million of policy loans ceded to reinsurers at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOther Long-term Investments: Other long-term investments are comprised primarily of tax credit partnerships, private equity partnerships, and real estate.\nTax credit partnerships in which we have invested were formed for the purpose of investing in the construction and rehabilitation of low-income housing. Because the partnerships are structured such that there is no return of principal, the primary sources of investment return from our tax credit partnerships are tax credits and tax benefits derived from passive losses on the investments, both of which may exhibit variability over the life of the investment. These partnerships are accounted for using either the proportional or the effective yield method, depending primarily on whether the tax credits are guaranteed through a letter of\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\ncredit, a tax indemnity agreement, or another similar arrangement. Tax credits received from these partnerships are reported in our consolidated statements of income as either a reduction of premium tax or a reduction of income tax. The amortization of the principal amount invested in these partnerships is reported as a component of either premium tax or income tax.\nOur investments in private equity partnerships are passive in nature and represent funds that are primarily invested in private credit, private equity, and real assets. We account for our investments in these partnerships using either the equity method or at fair value through net income depending on the level of ownership and the degree of our influence over partnership operating and financial policies. For investments in partnerships accounted for under the equity method, we report our investments at our share of the partnership's net asset value (NAV) and record our portion of partnership earnings as a component of net investment income. For investments in partnerships accounted for at fair value through net income, we also report our investments at our share of the partnership's NAV as a practical expedient for fair value with increases or decreases recorded as a component of net investment income. Distributions received from the funds arise from income generated by the underlying investments as well as the liquidation of the underlying investments and there is generally not a public market for these investments.\nInvestment real estate is primarily comprised of property held for the production of income and property held for sale. Property held for the production of income is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any write-downs to fair value for impairment losses. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. A review for impairment is made whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of the property exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows generated from the property, at which point the carrying value is written down to an estimated fair value. Real estate held for sale is carried at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value less estimated selling costs and is not further depreciated once classified as such.\nSee Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of our other long-term investments.\nShort-term Investments: Short-term investments are carried at cost. Short-term investments include investments maturing within one year of purchase, such as corporate commercial paper and U.S. Treasury bills, bank term deposits, and other cash accounts and cash equivalents earning interest.\nCash and Bank Deposits: Cash and bank deposits include cash on hand and non-interest bearing cash and deposit accounts.\nDerivative Financial Instruments: Derivative financial instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) are recognized as either other long-term investments or other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and are reported at fair value. The accounting for a derivative depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship. To qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging transaction, we formally document the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as the designation of the hedge as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Included in this documentation is how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the designated risk(s) related to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions as well as a description of the method that will be used to retrospectively and prospectively assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness.\nA derivative designated as a hedging instrument must be assessed as being highly effective in offsetting the designated risk(s) of the hedged item. Hedge effectiveness is formally assessed at inception and periodically throughout the life of the designated hedging relationship, using qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item. Quantitative methods include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value or cash flows associated with the hedge relationship.\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge and changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged are recognized in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period of change in fair value. For gains or losses on the derivative instrument that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, those gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income or loss and amortized into earnings in the same income statement line as the related hedged item. The gain or loss on the termination of a fair value hedge is recognized in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period in which the termination occurs. When interest rate swaps are used in hedge accounting relationships, periodic settlements are recorded in the same income statement line as the related settlements of the hedged items.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings and reported on the same income statement line item as the hedged item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings. The gain or loss on the termination of an effective cash flow hedge is reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings and reported on the same income statement line item as the hedged item and in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings.\nGains or losses on the termination of ineffective fair value or cash flow hedges are reported in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss. In the event a hedged item is disposed of or the anticipated transaction being hedged is no longer likely to occur, we will terminate the related derivative and recognize the gain or loss on termination in current earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss. In the event a hedged item is disposed of subsequent to the termination of the hedging transaction, we reclassify any remaining gain or loss on the hedge out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings as a component of the same income statement line item wherein we report the gain or loss on disposition of the hedged item.\nFor a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument, changes in the fair value of the derivative, together with the payment of periodic fees, if applicable, are recognized in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss during the period of change in fair value.\nCash flow activity from the settlement of derivative contracts is reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a component of proceeds from sales and maturities of other investments.\nIn our consolidated balance sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from those master netting agreements. See Notes 2, 3, and 4.\nFair Value Measurement: Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets and in our notes to our consolidated financial statements. We define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Therefore, fair value represents an exit price, not an entry price. The exit price objective applies regardless of our intent and/or ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date. Assets or liabilities with readily available actively quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value. When actively quoted prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities, or other observable inputs. If observable inputs are not available, unobservable inputs and/or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine fair value. We categorize our assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value into a three-level hierarchy, based on the significance of the inputs. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to inputs which are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). See Note 2.\nRealized Investment Gains and Losses: Realized investment gains and losses are reported as a component of revenue in the consolidated statements of income and are based upon specific identification of the investments sold. See Note 3.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Premiums Receivable: We establish an allowance for credit losses on premiums receivable, which is deducted from the gross amount of our receivable balance, to present the net amount we expect to collect on this asset. The allowance is forward-looking in nature and is calculated based on considerations regarding both historical events and future expectations. Periodic changes in the allowance are recorded through earnings.\nThe allowance on our premiums receivable is primarily determined using an aging analysis as well as historical lapse and delinquency rates by line of business, adjusted for key factors that may impact our future expectation of premium receipts such as changes in customer demographics, business practices, economic conditions, and product offerings. We write off premiums receivable amounts when determined to be uncollectible, which is based on various factors, including the aging of premiums receivable past the due date and specific communication with customers. At January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, the allowance for expected credit losses on premium receivables was $23.8 million and $38.8 million, respectively, on gross premium receivables of $543.0 million and $525.8 million, respectively. The allowance at January 1, 2020 includes amounts\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nthat were previously established at December 31, 2019. The allowance increased $15.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the uncertainty of collectability resulting from the impacts of COVID-19, partially offset by premium due write-offs and a decrease in the premium due balance. The primary factors considered in establishing the additional allowance were the recent increase in unemployment levels and the general uncertainty around the financial condition of some of our customers.\nDeferred Acquisition Costs: Incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts have been deferred. Such costs include commissions, other agency compensation, certain selection and policy issue expenses, and certain field expenses. Acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business, such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy, are excluded from deferral. Deferred acquisition costs are subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issue and loss recognition testing in subsequent years.\nDeferred acquisition costs related to non-interest sensitive policies are amortized in proportion to the premium income we expect to receive over the lives of the policies. Deferred acquisition costs related to interest sensitive policies are amortized over the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from surrender charges, mortality margins, investment returns, and expense margins. Deviations from projections result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period during which such events occur. Generally, the amortization periods for these policies approximate the estimated lives of the policies.\nFor certain products, policyholders can elect to modify product benefits, features, rights, or coverages by exchanging a contract for a new contract or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract. These transactions are known as internal replacement transactions. Internal replacement transactions wherein the modification does not substantially change the policy are accounted for as continuations of the replaced contracts. Unamortized deferred acquisition costs from the original policy continue to be amortized over the expected life of the new policy, and the costs of replacing the policy are accounted for as policy maintenance costs and expensed as incurred. Internal replacement transactions, principally on group contracts, that result in a policy that is substantially changed are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original policy and the issuance of a new policy. Unamortized deferred acquisition costs on the original policy that was replaced are immediately expensed, and the costs of acquiring the new policy are capitalized and amortized in accordance with our accounting policies for deferred acquisition costs.\nLoss recognition testing is performed on an annual basis, or more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as to future experience as of the date of the test. Insurance contracts are grouped for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests. If loss recognition testing indicates that deferred acquisition costs are not recoverable, the deficiency is charged to expense.\nGoodwill: Goodwill is the excess of the amount paid to acquire a business over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We review the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment testing compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit in an amount not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nProperty and Equipment: Property and equipment is reported at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is calculated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life. The accumulated depreciation for property and equipment was $1,239.9 million and $1,195.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nValue of Business Acquired: Value of business acquired represents the present value of future profits recorded in connection with the acquisition of a block of insurance policies. The asset is amortized based upon expected future premium income for non-interest sensitive insurance policies and estimated future gross profits from surrender charges, mortality margins, investment returns, and expense margins for interest sensitive insurance policies. The value of business acquired, which is included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets, was $83.8 million and $88.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The accumulated amortization for value of business acquired was $153.7 million and $144.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nThe amortization of value of business acquired, which is included in other expenses in the consolidated statements of income, was $6.1 million, $7.1 million, and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We periodically review the carrying amount of value of business acquired using the same methods used to evaluate deferred acquisition costs.\nPolicy and Contract Benefits: Policy and contract benefits represent amounts paid and expected to be paid based on reported losses and estimates of incurred but not reported losses for non-interest sensitive life and accident and health products. For interest sensitive products, benefits are the amounts paid and expected to be paid on insured claims in excess of the policyholders' policy fund balances.\nReserves for Policy and Contract Benefits: Policy reserves represent future policy and contract benefits for claims not yet incurred. Policy reserves for non-interest sensitive life and accident and health products are determined using the net level premium method. The reserves are calculated based upon assumptions as to interest, persistency, morbidity, and mortality that were appropriate at the date of issue. Discount rate assumptions are based on actual and expected net investment returns. Persistency assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations. Claim incidence and claim resolution rate assumptions related to morbidity and mortality are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations. The assumptions vary by plan, year of issue, and policy duration and include a provision for adverse deviation.\nPolicy reserves for group single premium annuities are developed on a net single premium method. The reserves are calculated based on assumptions as to interest, mortality, and retirement that were appropriate at the date of issue. Mortality assumptions are based upon industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations. The assumptions vary by year of issue.\nPolicy reserves for interest sensitive products are principally policyholder account values.\nPolicy reserves require ongoing loss recognition testing. We perform loss recognition tests on our policy reserves annually, or more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test, without a provision for adverse deviation. We group the policy reserves for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests. If the policy reserves determined using these best estimate assumptions are higher than our existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition cost balance, the existing policy reserves are increased or deferred acquisition costs are reduced to immediately recognize the deficiency. This becomes the new basis for policy reserves going forward, subject to future loss recognition testing.\nClaim reserves represent future policy and contract benefits for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us. Our claim reserves relate primarily to disability and long-term care policies and are calculated based on assumptions as to interest and claim resolution rates that are currently appropriate. Claim resolution rate assumptions are based on our actual experience. The interest rate assumptions used for discounting claim reserves are based on projected portfolio yield rates, after consideration for defaults and investment expenses, for the assets supporting the liabilities for the various product lines. Unlike policy reserves for which assumptions are generally established and locked in at the time of policy issuance, claim reserves are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change. Claim reserves do not include a provision for adverse deviation. See Note 6.\nPolicyholders Funds: Policyholders' funds represent customer deposits plus interest credited at contract rates. We control interest rate risk by investing in quality assets which have an aggregate duration that closely matches the expected duration of the liabilities.\nIncome Tax: Deferred taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred taxes have been measured using enacted statutory income tax rates and laws that are currently in effect. We record adjustments to our deferred taxes resulting from tax rate changes through income as of the date of enactment. We record deferred tax assets for tax positions taken in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our assessment of whether a position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based solely on its technical merits. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nlikely than not that an amount will not be realized. We follow an aggregate portfolio approach to release disproportionate tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income upon disposal of an entire business segment's portfolio. See Note 7.\nShort-term and Long-term Debt: Debt is generally carried at the unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized discount or premium and deferred debt issuance costs. Short-term debt consists of debt due within the next twelve months, including that portion of debt otherwise classified as long-term. The amortization of the original issue discount or premium as well as deferred debt issuance costs are recognized as a component of interest expense over the period the debt is expected to be outstanding. The carrying amount of long-term debt that is part of a fair value hedge program includes an adjustment to reflect the effect of the change in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. Net interest settlements for fair value hedges on our long-term debt are recognized as a component of interest expense. See Note 8.\nRight-of-Use Asset (ROU) and Lease Liability: ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for a specified lease term and are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments that we are obligated to pay arising from a lease and are included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception through a formal process that evaluates our right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. We account for the lease and non-lease components of our building leases separately and have elected to use the available practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components of our equipment leases as a single component. All of our leases are classified as operating. For each operating lease, we calculate a lease liability at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term and a corresponding ROU asset, adjusted for lease incentives. We do not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term leases for any class of underlying asset.\nWe consider the likelihood of renewal in determining the lease terms for the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of interest, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate of interest when readily determinable.\nOperating lease cost is calculated on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in other expenses in our consolidated statements of income. We amortize the ROU asset over the lease term on a pattern determined by the difference between the straight-line lease liability expense and the accretion of the imputed interest calculated on the lease liability. See Note 15.\nTreasury Stock and Retirement of Common Stock: Treasury stock is reflected as a reduction of stockholders' equity at cost. When shares are retired, the par value is removed from common stock, and the excess of the repurchase price over par is allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. See Note 10.\nRevenue Recognition: Our non-interest sensitive life and accident and health products are long-duration contracts, and premium income is recognized as revenue when due from policyholders. If the contracts are experience rated, the estimated ultimate premium is recognized as revenue over the period of the contract. The estimated ultimate premium, which is revised to reflect current experience, is based on estimated claim costs, expenses, and profit margins.\nFor interest sensitive products, the amounts collected from policyholders are considered deposits, and only the deductions during the period for cost of insurance, policy administration, and surrenders are included in revenue. Policyholders' funds represent funds deposited by contract holders and are not included in revenue.\nFees from our leave management services and administrative-services only (ASO) business are reported as other income when services are rendered.\nReinsurance: We routinely enter into reinsurance agreements with other insurance companies to spread risk and thereby limit losses from large exposures. For each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine if the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk in accordance with applicable accounting standards. If we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nReinsurance activity is accounted for on a basis consistent with the terms of the reinsurance contracts and the accounting used for the original policies issued. Premium income and benefits and change in reserves for future benefits are presented in our consolidated statements of income net of reinsurance ceded. Ceded liabilities for policy and contract benefits, future policy and contract benefits, and unearned premiums are reported on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets, as are ceded policy loans. Our reinsurance recoverable includes the balances due from reinsurers under the terms of the reinsurance agreements for these ceded balances as well as settlement amounts currently due.\nWhere applicable, gains or costs recognized on reinsurance transactions are generally deferred and amortized into earnings based upon expected future premium income for non-interest sensitive insurance policies and estimated future gross profits for interest sensitive insurance policies. Gains or costs recognized on reinsurance transactions for non-interest sensitive products for which we no longer receive premiums are generally deferred and amortized into earnings based upon expected claim reserve patterns. The cost of reinsurance included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020 was $813.0 million. The deferred gain on reinsurance included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $5.6 million and $8.5 million, respectively.\nUnder ceded reinsurance agreements wherein we are not relieved of our legal liability to our policyholders, if the assuming reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations, we remain contingently liable. We evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor concentration of credit risk to minimize this exposure. We may also require assets in trust, letters of credit, or other acceptable collateral to support our reinsurance recoverable balances. We estimate an allowance for expected credit losses for our reinsurance recoverable balance using a probability of default approach which incorporates key inputs and assumptions regarding historical insurer liquidation rates, counterparty credit ratings, and collateral received. Liquidation rates are derived from rating agency studies covering domestic insurers and are based on historical liquidation trends according to their respective credit ratings. When calculating our allowance, we apply these liquidation rates to the net amount of our credit exposure, which considers collateral arrangements such as letters of credit and trust accounts. We evaluate the factors used to determine our allowance on a quarterly basis to consider material changes in our assumptions and make adjustments accordingly. At January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, the allowance for expected credit losses on reinsurance recoverables was $1.8 million and $11.7 million, respectively. The allowance increased $9.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in the reinsurance recoverable balance, changes in certain counterparty credit ratings, and changes in our assumptions about the recoverability of receivables from certain counterparties. See Note 12.\nPremium Tax Expense: Premium tax expense is included in other expenses in the consolidated statements of income. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, premium tax expense was $175.5 million, $170.1 million, and $155.8 million, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation: The cost of stock-based compensation is generally measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Black-Scholes options valuation model is used for estimating the fair value of stock options, and the Monte-Carlo valuation model is used for estimating the fair value of performance units. Restricted stock units and stock success units are valued based on the fair value of common stock at the grant date. Stock-based awards are expensed over the requisite service period, or for performance units over the requisite service period, or remaining service period, if and when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be satisfied, with an offsetting increase to additional paid-in capital in stockholders' equity. Forfeitures of stock-based awards are recognized as they occur. See Note 11.\nEarnings Per Share: We compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Earnings per share assuming dilution is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period plus the shares representing the dilutive effect of stock-based awards. In computing earnings per share assuming dilution, only potential common shares resulting from stock-based awards that are dilutive (those that reduce earnings per share) are included. We use the treasury stock method to account for the effect of outstanding stock options and nonvested stock awards on the computation of earnings per share assuming dilution. See Note 10.\nTranslation of Foreign Currency: Revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet dates. The translation gain or loss is generally reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of income tax. We do not provide for deferred taxes to the extent unremitted foreign earnings are deemed permanently invested.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nAccounting for Participating Individual Life Insurance: Participating policies issued by one of our subsidiaries prior to its 1986 conversion from a mutual to a stock life insurance company will remain participating as long as the policies remain in-force. A Participation Fund Account (PFA) was established for the benefit of all such individual participating life and annuity policies and contracts. The assets of the PFA provide for the benefit, dividend, and certain expense obligations of the participating individual life insurance policies and annuity contracts. The assets of the PFA were $319.8 million and $311.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nAccounting Updates Adopted in 2020:\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) Description Date of Adoption Effect on Financial Statements\nASC 350 \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\" This update eliminated the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (the second step in the current two-step test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities should perform the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value, with the loss not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This guidance was applied in the period of adoption. January 1, 2020 The adoption of this update did not have an effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nASC 820 \"Fair Value Measurement\" This update amended the fair value measurement guidance by removing or clarifying certain existing disclosure requirements, while also adding new disclosure requirements. Specifically, this update removed certain disclosures related to Level 1 and Level 2 transfers and removed the discussion regarding valuation processes of Level 3 fair value measurements. The update modified guidance related to investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value to explicitly require disclosure regarding timing of liquidation of the investee's assets and timing of redemption restrictions. The update added disclosures around the changes in unrealized gains and losses in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 investments held at the end of the reporting period and adds disclosures regarding certain unobservable inputs on Level 3 fair value measurements. The guidance was applied both retrospectively and prospectively, depending on the specific requirement of the update. December 31, 2018 for the removal and modification of certain disclosures and January 1, 2020 for the addition of certain disclosures. The adoption of this update modified our disclosures but did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nASC 715 \"Compensation - Retirement Benefits\" This update amends the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit guidance by removing or clarifying certain existing disclosure requirements, while also adding new disclosure requirements. Specifically, this update removes the requirement to disclose the effects of a one-percentage point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend and the requirement to disclose amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as part of net periodic benefit cost of the next year. This update adds a requirement to describe the reasons for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for the period. The update also clarifies that the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and fair value of plan assets are to be disclosed for plans with PBOs or ABOs in excess of plan assets. The guidance is to be applied retrospectively and early adoption is permitted. December 31, 2020 The adoption of this update modified our disclosures but did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) Description Date of Adoption Effect on Financial Statements\nASC 326 \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\" This update amended the guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. The update added an impairment model known as the current expected credit loss model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses and will generally result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The current expected credit loss model applies to financial instruments such as mortgage loans, fixed maturity securities classified as held-to-maturity, and certain receivables. The update also modified the other-than-temporary impairment model used for available-for-sale fixed maturity securities such that credit losses are recognized as an allowance rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost of the security. The reversal of previously recognized credit losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities is allowed under specified circumstances. Additional disclosures are also required, including information used to develop the allowance for losses. The guidance was applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. For available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, the update was applied prospectively. Other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities prior to adoption of the update cannot be reversed. This guidance was applied in the period of adoption. January 1, 2020 See the summary table below for the financial statement impacts of this adoption on our financial statement line items at January 1, 2020. In addition, see Note 3 of the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" contained herein in this Item 1 for the additional disclosures required by the update.\nSummary of Financial Statement Impacts of Accounting Updates Adopted in 2020:\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nAccounting Updates Adopted in 2019:\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) Description Date of Adoption Effect on Financial Statements\nASC 220 \"Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income\" This update allowed entities to make an accounting policy election to reclassify the disproportionate tax effects arising as a result of the recognition of the enactment of the tax bill, H.R.1, An Act to Provide Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018, more commonly known as TCJA, from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. Tax effects that are disproportionate in accumulated other comprehensive income for reasons other than the TCJA may not be reclassified. This update required additional disclosures on whether an entity elects to reclassify the disproportionate tax effects and its policy for releasing tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income. January 1, 2019 The adoption of this update expanded certain of our disclosures but had no impact on our financial position or results of operations because we did not make the optional accounting policy election to reclassify the disproportionate tax effects resulting from the TCJA from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.\nASC 310 \"Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs\" This update shortened the amortization period to the earliest call date for certain callable debt securities held at a premium. This update did not impact securities held at a discount. January 1, 2019 The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nASC 718 \"Compensation - Stock Compensation\" This update generally aligned the accounting guidance for share-based payments issued to non-employees with guidance for share-based payments issued to employees. Specifically, the update required non-employee share-based payments to be measured using the grant date fair value of the equity instruments that an entity is obligated to issue when the good has been delivered or the service has been rendered rather than being remeasured through the performance completion date. Additionally, for non-employee share-based payments that contain performance conditions, the update changed the criteria regarding the recognition of compensation cost to when achievement of a performance condition is probable rather than upon actual achievement of the performance condition. January 1, 2019 The adoption of this update did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nASC 842 \"Leases\" This update changed the accounting for leases, requiring lessees to report most leases on their balance sheets, regardless of whether the lease is classified as a finance lease or an operating lease. For lessees, the initial lease liability is equal to the present value of lease payments, and a corresponding asset, adjusted for certain items, is also recorded. Expense recognition for lessees remained similar to previous accounting requirements for capital and operating leases. For lessors, the guidance modified the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The guidance was applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the period of adoption. In addition, the package of practical expedients available to leases that commenced prior to the date of adoption was applied. January 1, 2019 The adoption of this update resulted in the recognition of a lease liability of $122.0 million, with a corresponding right-of-use asset of $117.7 million, less an immaterial cumulative-effect decrease to retained earnings of $3.4 million related to our operating leases. There were also immaterial impacts to deferred income tax and income tax payable. This update did not have an impact on our results of operations, but it expanded our disclosures.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nAccounting Updates Adopted in 2018:\nASC Description Date of Adoption Effect on Financial Statements\nASC 230 \"Statement of Cash Flows\" This update provided clarifying guidance intended to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The update addressed eight specific cash flow issues that relate to various types of transactions. The guidance was applied retrospectively. January 1, 2018 The adoption of this update resulted in the reclassification of certain cash inflows between investing activities and operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows. The reclassification primarily related to cash distributions from equity method investees and the bifurcation of those distributions as either returns on investment or returns of investment which resulted in a reclassification of cash inflows from investing activities to operating activities. The remaining portion of the reclassification related to the receipt of proceeds from corporate-owned life insurance benefits which resulted in a reclassification of cash inflows from operating activities to investing activities. The adoption of this update had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nASC 606 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" These updates superseded virtually all existing guidance regarding the recognition of revenue from customers. Specifically excluded from the scope of these updates are insurance contracts, although our fee-based service products are included within the scope. Our fee-based service products, which are primarily sold in our Unum US segment, are reported in other income within our consolidated statements of income and represent less than one percent of our total revenue. The core principle of this guidance is that revenue recognition should depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Accordingly, we continue to recognize revenue for these fee-based service products as services are rendered. January 1, 2018 The adoption of these updates did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations and did not result in expanded disclosures due to the immaterial nature of our fee-based service products relative to our overall business.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nASC Description Date of Adoption Effect on Financial Statements\nASC 715 \"Compensation - Retirement Benefits\" This update required the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs to be included as a component of compensation costs in an entity's statement of income. Other components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs are required to be presented separately from the service cost along with a disclosure identifying the line items in which these costs are presented in the statement of income. The amendments in this update were applied retrospectively or prospectively depending on the specific requirement of the update. January 1, 2018 The adoption of this update resulted in the reclassification of service cost from the other expenses line item to the compensation expense line item on our consolidated statements of income but had no effect on our financial position or results of operations. We elected to use the practical expedient for the retrospective application of this update.\nASC 740 \"Income Taxes\" This update eliminated the exception that required the tax effect of intra-entity asset transfers other than inventory to be deferred until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. It required recognition of tax expense from the sale of the asset in the seller\u2019s tax jurisdiction when the transfer occurs, even though the pre-tax effects of that transaction are eliminated in consolidation. January 1, 2018 The adoption of this update did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nASC 815 \"Derivatives and Hedge Accounting\" This update provided targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities for both nonfinancial and financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements, eases certain documentation and effectiveness assessment requirements, and enhances transparency through expanded disclosures. The amended presentation and disclosure guidance was adopted prospectively. Early adoption was permitted. January 1, 2018 We elected to early adopt this update. The adoption of this update did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations; however, it expanded our disclosures. This update also simplified hedge documentation requirements and expanded available hedging strategies.\nASC 825 \"Financial Instruments - Overall\" This update changed the accounting and disclosure requirements for certain financial instruments. These changes include a requirement to measure equity investments, other than those that result in consolidation or are accounted for under the equity method, at fair value through net income unless the investment qualifies for certain practicability exceptions. In addition, the update clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities. Changes also included the modification of certain disclosures around the fair value of financial instruments, including the requirement for separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category, as well as the elimination of certain disclosures around methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value. The guidance was applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. January 1, 2018 The adoption of this update resulted in a cumulative-effect reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income of $17.5 million with a corresponding increase to retained earnings of $14.5 million, a decrease to other long-term investments of $3.8 million, and a decrease to deferred income tax liability of $0.8 million.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nAccounting Updates Outstanding:\nASC Description Date of Adoption Effect on Financial Statements\nASC 740 \"Income Taxes\" The amendments in this update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions in the guidance related to the following: 1. losses in continuing operations when there is income in other items, 2. foreign subsidiaries becoming equity method investments and vice versa, and 3. year-to-date interim period losses exceeding anticipated loss for the year. The amendments also simplify the accounting for income taxes related to the following: 1. franchise taxes partially based on income, 2. step up in the tax basis of goodwill, 3. allocation of tax expense to entities not subject to tax, 4. enacted changes in tax law or rates in interim periods, and 5. employee stock ownership programs and investments in qualified affordable housing projects accounted for using the equity method. January 1, 2021 The adoption of this update will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nASC 848 \"Reference Rate Reform\" The amendments in this update provide optional guidance, for a limited period of time, to ease the potential burden in accounting for and recognizing the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting. The guidance allows for various practical expedients and exceptions when applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. Specifically, the guidance provides certain practical expedients for contract modifications, fair value hedges, and cash flow hedges and also provides certain exceptions related to changes in the critical terms of a hedging relationship. The guidance also allows for a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities that were both classified as held-to-maturity prior to January 1, 2020 and reference a rate affected by the reform. Adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the interim period that includes March 12, 2020 (the issuance date of the update), or any date thereafter, through December 31, 2022, at which point the guidance will sunset. We have not yet determined the impact on our financial position or results of operations if we elect to adopt this guidance.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nASC Description Date of Adoption Effect on Financial Statements\nASC 944 \"Financial Services - Insurance\" This update significantly amends the accounting and disclosure requirements for long-duration insurance contracts. These changes include a requirement to review, and if necessary, update cash flow assumptions used to measure the liability for future policy benefits for traditional and limited-payment contracts at least annually, with changes recognized in earnings. In addition, an entity will be required to update the discount rate assumption at each reporting date using a yield that is reflective of an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument, with changes recognized in other comprehensive income. These changes result in the elimination of the provision for risk of adverse deviation and premium deficiency (or loss recognition) testing. The update also requires that an entity measure all market risk benefits associated with deposit contracts at fair value, with changes recognized in earnings except for the portion attributable to a change in the instrument-specific credit risk, which is to be recognized in other comprehensive income. This update also simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs by requiring amortization on a constant level basis over the expected term of the related contracts. Deferred acquisition costs are required to be written off for unexpected contract terminations but are no longer subject to an impairment test. Significant additional disclosures will also be required, which include disaggregated rollforwards of certain liability balances and the disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information about expected cash flows, estimates, and assumptions. The application of this guidance will vary based upon the specific requirements of the update but will generally result in either a modified retrospective or full retrospective approach with changes applied as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. Early adoption is permitted. January 1, 2023 We are currently evaluating the impact of the update and expect that the adoption may have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. The update will also significantly expand our disclosures.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments\nFair Value Measurements for Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value\nWe report fixed maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale securities, derivative financial instruments, and unrestricted equity securities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. We report our investments in private equity partnerships at our share of the partnerships' net asset value per share or its equivalent (NAV) as a practical expedient for fair value. See Note 1.\nThe degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value. An active market for a financial instrument is a market in which transactions for an asset or a similar asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and should be used to measure fair value whenever available. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that require more judgment. Pricing observability is generally impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the characteristics specific to the transaction, and overall market conditions.\nWe classify financial instruments in accordance with a fair value hierarchy consisting of three levels based on the observability of valuation inputs:\n\u2022Level 1 - the highest category of the fair value hierarchy classification wherein inputs are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\n\u2022Level 2 - valued using inputs (other than prices included in Level 1) that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument's anticipated life.\n\u2022Level 3 - the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level 3 are generally those that are valued using unobservable inputs to extrapolate an estimated fair value.\nValuation Methodologies of Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value\nValuation techniques used for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value are generally categorized into three types. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach converts future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount, or a discounted amount. The cost approach is based upon the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset, or the current replacement cost.\nWe use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available that can be obtained without undue cost and effort. In some cases, a single valuation technique will be appropriate (for example, when valuing an asset or liability using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities). In other cases, multiple valuation techniques will be appropriate. If we use multiple valuation techniques to measure fair value, we evaluate and weigh the results, as appropriate, considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results. A fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances.\nThe selection of the valuation method(s) to apply considers the definition of an exit price and depends on the nature of the asset or liability being valued. For assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, we generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, and to a lesser extent, the income approach. We believe the market approach provides more observable data than the income approach, considering the type of investments we hold. Our fair value measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputs. When using a pricing service, we obtain the vendor's pricing documentation to ensure we understand their methodologies. We periodically review and approve the selection of our\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued\npricing vendors to ensure we are in agreement with their current methodologies. When markets are less active, brokers may rely more on models with inputs based on the information available only to the broker. Our internal investment management professionals, which include portfolio managers and analysts, monitor securities priced by brokers and evaluate their prices for reasonableness based on benchmarking to available primary and secondary market information. In weighing a broker quote as an input to fair value, we place less reliance on quotes that do not reflect the result of market transactions. We also consider the nature of the quote, particularly whether it is a bid or market quote. If prices in an inactive market do not reflect current prices for the same or similar assets, adjustments may be necessary to arrive at fair value. When relevant market data is unavailable, which may be the case during periods of market uncertainty, the income approach can, in suitable circumstances, provide a more appropriate fair value. During 2020, we have applied valuation approaches and techniques on a consistent basis to similar assets and liabilities and consistent with those approaches and techniques used at year end 2019.\nFixed Maturity and Equity Securities\nWe use observable and unobservable inputs in measuring the fair value of our fixed maturity and equity securities. For securities categorized as Level 1, fair values equal active Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) pricing or unadjusted broker market maker prices. For securities categorized as Level 2 or Level 3, inputs that may be used in valuing each class of securities at any given time period are disclosed below. Actual inputs used to determine fair values will vary for each reporting period depending on the availability of inputs which may, at times, be affected by the lack of market liquidity.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued\nThe management of our investment portfolio includes establishing pricing policy and reviewing the reasonableness of sources and inputs used in developing pricing. We review all prices that vary between multiple pricing vendors by a threshold that is outside a normal market range for the asset type. In the event we receive a vendor's market price that does not appear reasonable based on our market analysis, we may challenge the price and request further information about the assumptions and methodologies used by the vendor to price the security. We may change the vendor price based on a better data source such as an actual trade. We also review all prices that did not change from the prior month to ensure that these prices are within our expectations. The overall valuation process for determining fair values may include adjustments to valuations obtained from our pricing sources when they do not represent a valid exit price. These adjustments may be made when, in our judgment and considering our knowledge of the financial conditions and industry in which the issuer operates, certain features of the financial instrument require that an adjustment be made to the value originally obtained from our pricing sources. These features may include the complexity of the financial instrument, the market in which the financial instrument is traded, counterparty credit risk, credit structure, concentration, or liquidity. Additionally, an adjustment to the price derived from a model typically reflects our judgment of the inputs that other participants in the market for the financial instrument being measured at fair value would consider in pricing that same financial instrument. In the event an asset is sold, we test the validity of the fair value determined by our valuation techniques by comparing the selling price to the fair value determined for the asset in the immediately preceding month end reporting period.\nCertain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices and/or observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market liquidity. For these securities, we use internally prepared valuations, including valuations based on estimates of future profitability, to estimate the fair value. Additionally, we may obtain prices from independent third-party brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities. Key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued\nthese securities include risk free interest rates, risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any), and other factors involving significant assumptions which may or may not reflect those of an active market.\nThe parameters and inputs used to validate a price on a security may be adjusted for assumptions about risk and current market conditions on a quarter to quarter basis, as certain features may be more significant drivers of valuation at the time of pricing. Changes to inputs in valuations are not changes to valuation methodologies; rather, the inputs are modified to reflect direct or indirect impacts on asset classes from changes in market conditions.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately 9.6 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued using active trades from TRACE pricing or broker market maker prices for which there was current market activity in that specific security (comparable to receiving one binding quote). The prices obtained were not adjusted, and the assets were classified as Level 1.\nThe remaining 90.4 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on non-binding quotes or other observable and unobservable inputs, as discussed below:\n\u202274.9 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices from pricing services that generally use observable inputs such as prices for securities or comparable securities in active markets in their valuation techniques. These assets were classified as Level 2.\n\u202210.4 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on one or more non-binding broker quotes, if validated by observable market data. When only one price is available, it is used if observable inputs and analysis confirms that it is appropriate. These assets, for which we were able to validate the price using other observable market data, were classified as Level 2.\n\u20225.1 percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices of comparable securities, internal models, or pricing services or other non-binding quotes with no other observable market data. These assets were classified as either Level 2 or Level 3, with the categorization dependent on whether there was other observable market data.\nDerivatives\nFair values for derivatives other than embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance arrangements are based on market quotes or pricing models and represent the net amount of cash we would have paid or received if the contracts had been settled or closed as of the last day of the period. We analyze credit default swap spreads relative to the average credit spread embedded within the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-setting syndicate in determining the effect of credit risk on our derivatives' fair values. If net counterparty credit risk for a derivative asset is determined to be material and is not adequately reflected in the LIBOR-based fair value obtained from our pricing sources, we adjust the valuations obtained from our pricing sources. For purposes of valuing net counterparty risk, we measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the price that would be received to sell a net long position or transfer a net short position for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. In regard to our own credit risk component, we adjust the valuation of derivative liabilities wherein the counterparty is exposed to our credit risk when the LIBOR-based valuation of our derivatives obtained from pricing sources does not effectively include an adequate credit component for our own credit risk.\nFair values for our embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement are estimated using internal pricing models and represent the hypothetical value of the duration mismatch of assets and liabilities, interest rate risk, and third party credit risk embedded in the modified coinsurance arrangement.\nWe consider transactions in inactive markets to be less representative of fair value. We use all available observable inputs when measuring fair value, but when significant unobservable inputs are used, we classify these assets or liabilities as Level 3.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued\nPrivate Equity Partnerships\nOur private equity partnerships represent funds that are primarily invested in private credit, private equity, and real assets, as described below. Distributions received from the funds arise from income generated by the underlying investments as well as the liquidation of the underlying investments. There is generally not a public market for these investments.\nThe following tables present additional information about our private equity partnerships, including commitments for additional investments which may or may not be funded:\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued\n(a)Private Credit - The limited partnerships described in this category employ various investment strategies, generally providing direct lending or other forms of debt financing including first-lien, second-lien, mezzanine, and subordinated loans. The limited partnerships have credit exposure to corporates, physical assets, and/or financial assets within a variety of industries (including manufacturing, healthcare, energy, business services, technology, materials, and retail) in North America and, to a lesser extent, outside of North America. As of December 31, 2020, the estimated remaining life of the investments that do not allow for redemptions is approximately 37 percent in the next 3 years, 38 percent during the period from 3 to 5 years, 22 percent during the period from 5 to 10 years, and 3 percent during the period from 10 to 15 years.\n(b)Private Equity - The limited partnerships described in this category employ various strategies generally investing in controlling or minority control equity positions directly in companies and/or assets across various industries (including manufacturing, healthcare, energy, business services, technology, materials, and retail), primarily in private markets within North America and, to a lesser extent, outside of North America. As of December 31, 2020, the estimated remaining life of the investments that do not allow for redemptions is approximately 20 percent in the next 3 years, 35 percent during the period from 3 to 5 years, 44 percent during the period from 5 to 10 years, and 1 percent during the period from 10 to 15 years.\n(c)Real Assets - The limited partnerships described in this category employ various strategies, which include investing in the equity and/or debt financing of physical assets, including infrastructure (energy, power, water/wastewater, communications), transportation (including airports, ports, toll roads, aircraft, railcars) and real estate in North America, Europe, South America, and Asia. As of December 31, 2020, the estimated remaining life of the investments that do not allow for redemptions is approximately 12 percent in the next 3 years, 23 percent during period from 3 to 5 years, 64 percent during the period from 5 to 10 years, and 1 percent during the period from 10 to 15 years.\nWe record changes in our share of net asset value of the partnerships in net investment income. We receive financial information related to our investments in partnerships and generally record investment income on a one-quarter lag in accordance with our accounting policy.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued\nThe following tables present information about financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis by fair value level, based on the observability of the inputs used:\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued\nChanges in assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) are as follows:\n1Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued\nRealized and unrealized investment gains and losses presented in the preceding tables represent gains and losses only for the time during which the applicable financial instruments were classified as Level 3. The transfers between levels resulted primarily from a change in observability of three inputs used to determine fair values of the securities transferred: (1) transactional data for new issuance and secondary trades, (2) broker/dealer quotes and pricing, primarily related to changes in the level of activity in the market and whether the market was considered orderly, and (3) comparable bond metrics from which to perform an analysis. For fair value measurements of financial instruments that were transferred either into or out of Level 3, we reflect the transfers using the fair value at the beginning of the period. We believe this allows for greater transparency, as all changes in fair value that arise during the reporting period of the transfer are disclosed as a component of our Level 3 reconciliation.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued\nThe table below provides quantitative information regarding the significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements derived from internal models. Unobservable inputs for fixed maturity securities are weighted by the fair value of the securities. Certain securities classified as Level 3 are excluded from the table below due to limitations in our ability to obtain the underlying inputs used by external pricing sources.\n(a)Represents basis point adjustments to apply a discount due to the illiquidity of an investment\n(b)Represents basis point adjustments for credit-specific factors\n(c)Represents a decision to price based on par value, cost, or owner's equity when limited data is available\n(d)Represents various actuarial assumptions required to derive the liability cash flows. Fair value of embedded derivative is most often driven by the change in the weighted average credit spread to the swap curve for the assets backing the hypothetical loan.\nIsolated increases in unobservable inputs other than market convention will result in a lower fair value measurement, whereas isolated decreases will result in a higher fair value measurement. The unobservable input for market convention is not sensitive to input movements. The projected liability cash flows used in the fair value measurement of our Level 3 embedded derivative are based on expected claim payments. If claim payments increase, the projected liability cash flows will increase, resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivative. Decreases in projected liability cash flows will result in an increase in the fair value of the embedded derivative.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued\nFair Value Measurements for Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value\nThe methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values of financial instruments not carried at fair value are discussed as follows:\nMortgage Loans: Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and interest rates currently being offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings and maturities. Loans with similar characteristics are aggregated for purposes of the calculations.\nPolicy Loans: Fair values for policy loans, net of reinsurance ceded, are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and interest rates currently being offered to policyholders with similar policies. Carrying amounts for ceded policy loans, which equal $3,390.6 million and $3,490.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, approximate fair value and are reported on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. A change in interest rates for ceded policy loans will not impact our financial position because the benefits and risks are fully ceded to reinsuring counterparties.\nMiscellaneous Long-term Investments: Carrying amounts for tax credit partnerships equal the unamortized balance of our contractual commitments and approximate fair value. Our shares of FHLB common stock are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.\nLong-term Debt: Fair values for long-term debt are obtained from independent pricing services or discounted cash flow analyses based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.\nFederal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) Funding Agreements: Funding agreements with the FHLB represent cash advances used for the purpose of investing in fixed maturity securities. Carrying amounts approximate fair value.\nUnfunded Commitments to Investment Partnerships: Unfunded equity commitments represent amounts that we have committed to fund certain investment partnerships. These commitments are legally binding, subject to the partnerships meeting specified conditions. Carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate fair value.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued\nThe following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our financial instruments not measured at fair value and indicates the level in the fair value hierarchy of the estimated fair value measurement based on the observability of the inputs used:\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 2 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments - Continued\nThe carrying values of financial instruments such as short-term investments, cash and bank deposits, accounts and premiums receivable, accrued investment income, securities lending agreements, and short-term debt approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. As such, these financial instruments are not included in the above chart.\nFair values for insurance contracts other than investment contracts are not required to be disclosed. However, the fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in our overall management of interest rate risk, which seeks to minimize exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contracts.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 3 - Investments\nFixed Maturity Securities\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, all fixed maturity securities were classified as available-for-sale. The amortized cost and fair values of securities by security type are shown as follows:\n1Allowance for Credit Losses\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 3 - Investments - Continued\nThe following charts indicate the length of time our fixed maturity securities have been in a gross unrealized loss position.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 3 - Investments - Continued\nThe following is a distribution of the maturity dates for fixed maturity securities. The maturity dates have not been adjusted for possible calls or prepayments.\nThe following chart depicts an analysis of our fixed maturity security portfolio between investment-grade and below-investment-grade categories as of December 31, 2020:\nThe unrealized losses on investment-grade fixed maturity securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in market or sector credit spreads which occurred subsequent to the acquisition of the securities. Below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities are generally more likely to develop credit concerns than investment-grade securities. At December 31, 2020, the unrealized losses in our below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities were generally due to credit spreads in certain industries or sectors and, to a lesser extent, credit concerns related to specific securities. For each specific security in an unrealized loss position, we believe that there are positive factors which mitigate credit concerns and that the securities for which we have not recorded a credit loss will recover in value. We have the ability and intent to continue to hold these securities to recovery of amortized cost and believe that no credit losses have occurred.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 3 - Investments - Continued\nAs of December 31, 2020, we held 47 individual investment-grade fixed maturity securities and 21 individual below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position, of which 5 investment-grade fixed maturity securities and 13 below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities had been in an unrealized loss position continuously for over one year.\nIn determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security represents a credit loss, we evaluate the following factors:\n\u2022Whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security\n\u2022Whether we intend to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis\n\u2022Whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments\n\u2022The significance of the decline in value\n\u2022Current and future business prospects and trends of earnings\n\u2022The valuation of the security's underlying collateral\n\u2022Relevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cycles\n\u2022Market conditions\n\u2022Rating agency and governmental actions\n\u2022Bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity\n\u2022Adverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investments\n\u2022Changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date\n\u2022Any other key measures for the related security\nWhile determining whether a credit loss exists is a judgmental area, we utilize a formal, well-defined, and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio, supported by issuer specific research and documentation as of the end of each period. The process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and the recording of credit losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have a credit loss. We calculate the allowance for credit losses of fixed maturity securities based on the present value of our best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition. When estimating future cash flows, we analyze the strength of the issuer\u2019s balance sheet, its debt obligations and near-term funding arrangements, cash flow and liquidity, the profitability of its core businesses, the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity, its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment, and its access to capital markets. As of December 31, 2020, with respect to the fixed maturity securities for which an allowance for credit losses was recognized, we do not intend to sell these securities, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of our estimated value.\nThe following table presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, all of which are classified as \"all other corporate bonds\" in the preceding tables, at December 31, 2020:\nAt December 31, 2020, we had commitments of $21.0 million to fund private placement fixed maturity securities, the amount of which may or may not be funded.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 3 - Investments - Continued\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe invest in variable interests issued by variable interest entities. These investments include tax credit partnerships, private equity partnerships, and special purpose entities. For those variable interests that are not consolidated in our financial statements, we are not the primary beneficiary because we have neither the power to direct the activities that are most significant to economic performance nor the responsibility to absorb a majority of the expected losses. The determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary is performed at the time of our initial investment and at the date of each subsequent reporting period.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the carrying amount of our variable interest entity investments that are not consolidated in our financial statements was $776.8 million, comprised of $29.3 million of tax credit partnerships and $747.5 million of private equity partnerships. At December 31, 2019, the carrying amount of our variable interest entity investments that are not consolidated in our financial statements was $675.1 million, comprised of $58.4 million of tax credit partnerships and $616.7 million of private equity partnerships. These variable interest entity investments are reported as other long-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company invests in tax credit partnerships primarily for the receipt of income tax credits and tax benefits derived from passive losses on the investments. Amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of income are as follows:\nContractually, we are a limited partner in these tax credit partnerships, and our maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment, which includes $0.9 million of unfunded unconditional commitments at December 31, 2020. See Note 2 for commitments to fund private equity partnerships.\nMortgage Loans\nOur mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified by both geographic region and property type to reduce risk of concentration. All of our mortgage loans are collateralized by commercial real estate. When issuing a new loan, our general policy is not to exceed a loan-to-value ratio, or the ratio of the loan balance to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, of 75 percent. We update the loan-to-value ratios at least every three years for each loan, and properties undergo a general inspection at least every two years. Our general policy for newly issued loans is to have a debt service coverage ratio greater than 1.25 times on a normalized 25 year amortization period. We update our debt service coverage ratios annually.\nWe adopted new accounting guidance that requires us to estimate an allowance for expected credit losses effective January 1, 2020. We carry our mortgage loans at amortized cost less the allowance for expected credit losses. The amortized cost of our mortgage loans was $2,445.2 million and $2,397.0 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The allowance for expected credit losses was $13.1 million at December 31, 2020. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loan's contractual interest rate. We report accrued interest income for our mortgage loans as accrued investment income on our consolidated balance sheets, and the amount of the accrued income was $8.0 million and $8.3 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 3 - Investments - Continued\nThe carrying amount of mortgage loans by property type and geographic region are presented below.\nThe risk in our mortgage loan portfolio is primarily related to vacancy rates. Events or developments, such as economic conditions that impact the ability of the borrowers to ensure occupancy of the property, may have a negative effect on our mortgage loan portfolio, particularly to the extent that our portfolio is concentrated in an affected region or property type. An increase in vacancies increases the probability of default, which would negatively affect our expected losses in our mortgage loan portfolio.\nWe evaluate each of our mortgage loans individually for impairment and assign an internal credit quality rating based on a comprehensive rating system used to evaluate the credit risk of the loan. The factors we use to derive our internal credit ratings may include the following:\n\u2022Loan-to-value ratio\n\u2022Debt service coverage ratio based on current operating income\n\u2022Property location, including regional economics, trends and demographics\n\u2022Age, condition, and construction quality of property\n\u2022Current and historical occupancy of property\n\u2022Lease terms relative to market\n\u2022Tenant size and financial strength\n\u2022Borrower's financial strength\n\u2022Borrower's equity in transaction\n\u2022Additional collateral, if any\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 3 - Investments - Continued\nAlthough all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis, loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios are the most critical factors in determining whether we will initially issue the loan and also in assigning values and determining impairment. We assign an overall rating to each loan using an internal rating scale of AA (highest quality) to B (lowest quality). We review and adjust, as needed, our internal credit quality ratings on an annual basis. This review process is performed more frequently for mortgage loans deemed to have a higher risk of delinquency.\nMortgage loans, sorted by the applicable credit quality indicators, are as follows:\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 3 - Investments - Continued\nThe following table presents the amortized cost of our mortgage loans by year of origination and credit quality indicators at December 31, 2020:\nThe following table presents a rollforward of allowance for expected credit losses by loan-to-value ratio:\nThe increase in our estimate of expected losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily due to the expected impact of COVID-19, specifically impacts to underlying commercial real estate values, and reflects market conditions at December 31, 2020.\nThere were no troubled debt restructurings during 2020 or 2019. We had one mortgage loan which was modified in a troubled debt restructuring during the second quarter of 2018. The loan had a principal balance of $3.6 million prior to the restructuring, wherein the terms of the loan were modified to reduce monthly payments to interest-only at the current note rate and to permit a discounted payoff by September 2018. At time of restructuring, we recorded an allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans and recognized an impairment loss of $0.2 million in the second quarter of 2018. The payoff of the loan did not occur in\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 3 - Investments - Continued\nSeptember 2018 and the loan was considered impaired as of December 31, 2018. The loan was settled during the first quarter of 2019 resulting in an additional loss of $0.1 million. At December 31, 2020, we held no mortgage loans that were greater than 90 days past due regarding principal and/or interest payments.\nWe had no loan foreclosures for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, or 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we had no impaired mortgage loans. Our average investment in impaired mortgage loans was $0.6 million, and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We did not recognize any interest income during 2020, 2019 or 2018 on mortgage loans subsequent to impairment.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had commitments of $11.4 million to fund certain commercial mortgage loans. Consistent with how we determine the estimate of current expected credit losses for our funded mortgage loans each period, we estimate expected credit losses for loans that have not been funded but we are committed to fund at the end of each period. At December 31, 2020, we had $0.1 million of expected credit losses related to unfunded commitments on our consolidated balance sheets.\nInvestment Real Estate\nOur investment real estate balance was $106.3 million and $90.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and the associated accumulated depreciation was $97.7 million and $49.8 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $36.6 million in impairments related to certain of our real estate held for investment. We did not recognize any impairments on investment real estate during 2019 and we recognized $0.6 million in impairments in 2018.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nTo manage our cash position more efficiently, we may enter into repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions. We generally use repurchase agreements as a means to finance the purchase of invested assets or for short-term general business purposes until projected cash flows become available from our operations or existing investments. Our repurchase agreements are typically outstanding for less than 30 days. We post collateral through our repurchase agreement transactions whereby the counterparty commits to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them to us at a later, specified date. The fair value of collateral posted is generally 102 percent of the cash received.\nOur investment policy also permits us to lend fixed maturity securities to unaffiliated financial institutions in short-term securities lending agreements. These agreements increase our investment income with minimal risk. Our securities lending policy requires that a minimum of 102 percent of the fair value of the securities loaned be maintained as collateral. We may receive cash and/or securities as collateral under these agreements. Cash received as collateral is typically reinvested in short-term investments. If securities are received as collateral, we are not permitted to sell or re-post them.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities loaned to third parties under our securities lending program was $96.6 million, for which we received collateral in the form of cash and securities of $17.6 million and $82.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying amount of fixed maturity securities loaned to third parties under our securities lending program was $176.4 million, for which we received collateral in the form of securities of $186.5 million. We had no outstanding repurchase agreements at December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 3 - Investments - Continued\nThe remaining contractual maturities of our securities lending agreements disaggregated by class of collateral pledged are as follows:\nCertain of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are members of regional FHLBs. Membership, which requires that we purchase a minimum amount of FHLB common stock on which we receive dividends, provides access to low-cost funding. Advances received from the FHLB are used for the purchase of fixed maturity securities. Additional common stock purchases may be required, based on the amount of funds we borrow from the FHLBs. The carrying value of common stock owned, collateral posted, and advances received are as follows:\nOffsetting of Financial Instruments\nWe enter into master netting agreements with each of our derivatives counterparties. These agreements provide for conditional rights of set-off upon the occurrence of an early termination event. An early termination event is considered a default, and it allows the non-defaulting party to offset its contracts in a loss position against any gain positions or payments due to the defaulting party. Under our agreements, default type events are defined as failure to pay or deliver as contractually agreed, misrepresentation, bankruptcy, or merger without assumption. See Note 4 for further discussion of collateral related to our derivative contracts.\nWe have securities lending agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions that post collateral to us in return for the use of our fixed maturity securities. A right of set-off exists that allows us to keep and apply collateral received in the event of default by the counterparty. Default within a securities lending agreement would typically occur if the counterparty failed to return the securities borrowed from us as contractually agreed. In addition, if we default by not returning collateral received, the counterparty has a right of set-off against our securities or any other amounts due to us.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 3 - Investments - Continued\nShown below are our financial instruments that either meet the accounting requirements that allow them to be offset in our balance sheets or that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement. Our accounting policy is to not offset these financial instruments in our balance sheets. Net amounts disclosed below have been reduced by the amount of collateral pledged to or received from our counterparties.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 3 - Investments - Continued\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income reported in our consolidated statements of income is presented below. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\n1 The net unrealized gain (loss) recognized in net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to perpetual preferred securities still held at December 31, 2020 was $(4.6) million. The net unrealized gain (loss) recognized in net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2019 related to perpetual preferred securities still held at December 31, 2019 was $3.3 million.\n2 The net unrealized gain (loss) recognized in net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to private equity partnerships still held at December 31, 2020 was $(8.7) million. The net unrealized gain (loss) recognized in net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2019 related to private equity partnerships still held at December 31, 2019 was $6.8 million.

See Note 12 for further discussion.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments\nPurpose of Derivatives\nWe are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are interest rate risk, risk related to matching duration for our assets and liabilities, foreign currency risk, and credit risk. Historically, we have utilized current and forward interest rate swaps, current and forward currency swaps, forward benchmark interest rate locks, currency forward contracts, forward contracts on specific fixed income securities, and credit default swaps. Transactions hedging interest rate risk are primarily associated with our individual and group long-term care and individual and group disability products. All other product portfolios are periodically reviewed to determine if hedging strategies would be appropriate for risk management purposes. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges and used to reduce our exposure to interest rate and duration risk are as follows:\n\u2022Interest rate swaps are used to hedge interest rate risks and to improve the matching of assets and liabilities. An interest rate swap is an agreement in which we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and variable rate interest amounts. We use interest rate swaps to hedge the anticipated purchase of fixed maturity securities thereby protecting us from the potential adverse impact of declining interest rates on the associated policy reserves. We also use interest rate swaps to hedge the potential adverse impact of rising interest rates in anticipation of issuing fixed rate long-term debt.\n\u2022Forward benchmark interest rate locks are used to minimize interest rate risk associated with the anticipated purchase or disposal of fixed maturity securities or debt. A forward benchmark interest rate lock is a derivative contract without an initial investment where we and the counterparty agree to purchase or sell a specific benchmark interest rate fixed maturity bond at a future date at a pre-determined price.\nDerivatives designated as fair value hedges and used to reduce our exposure to interest rate and duration risk are as follows:\n\u2022Interest rate swaps are used to effectively convert certain of our fixed rate securities into floating rate securities which are used to fund our floating rate long-term debt. Under these swap agreements, we receive a variable rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. Additionally, we use interest rate swaps to effectively convert certain fixed rate, long-term debt into floating rate long-term debt. Under these swap agreements, we receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest.\nDerivatives designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and used to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk are as follows:\n\u2022Foreign currency interest rate swaps are used to hedge the currency risk of certain foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity securities owned for portfolio diversification. Under these swap agreements, we agree to pay, at specified intervals, fixed rate foreign currency-denominated principal and interest payments in exchange for fixed rate payments in the functional currency of the operating segment.\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments and used to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk and credit losses on securities owned are as follows:\n\u2022Foreign currency interest rate swaps previously designated as hedges were used to hedge the currency risk of certain foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity securities owned for portfolio diversification. These derivatives were effective hedges prior to novation to a new counterparty. In conjunction with the novation, these derivatives were de-designated as hedges. We agree to pay, at specified intervals, fixed rate foreign currency-denominated principal and interest payments in exchange for fixed rate payments in the functional currency of the operating segment. We hold offsetting swaps wherein we agree to pay fixed rate principal and interest payments in the functional currency of the operating segment in exchange for fixed rate foreign currency-denominated payments.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments - Continued\n\u2022Credit default swaps are used as economic hedges against credit risk but do not qualify for hedge accounting. A credit default swap is an agreement in which we agree with another party to pay, at specified intervals, a fixed-rate fee in exchange for insurance against a credit event on a specific investment. If a defined credit event occurs, our counterparty may either pay us a net cash settlement, or we may surrender the specific investment to them in exchange for cash equal to the full notional amount of the swap. Credit events typically include events such as bankruptcy, failure to pay, or certain types of debt restructuring.\n\u2022Foreign currency forward contracts are used to minimize foreign currency risk. A foreign currency forward is a derivative without an initial investment where we and the counterparty agree to exchange a specific amount of currencies, at a specific exchange rate, on a specific date. We use these forward contracts to hedge the currency risk arising from foreign-currency denominated securities.\nDerivative Risks\nThe basic types of risks associated with derivatives are market risk (that the value of the derivative will be adversely impacted by changes in the market, primarily the change in interest and exchange rates) and credit risk (that the counterparty will not perform according to the terms of the contract). The market risk of the derivatives should generally offset the market risk associated with the hedged financial instrument or liability. To help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives, we enter into master netting agreements with our counterparties whereby contracts in a gain position can be offset against contracts in a loss position. We also typically enter into bilateral, cross-collateralization agreements with our counterparties to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives. These agreements require the counterparty in a loss position to submit acceptable collateral with the other counterparty in the event the net loss position meets or exceeds an agreed upon amount. Credit exposure on derivatives is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position, including accrued interest receivable less collateral held. At December 31, 2020, we had $0.7 million credit exposure on derivatives. At December 31, 2019, we had no credit exposure on derivatives. The table below summarizes the nature and amount of collateral received from and posted to our derivative counterparties.\nSee Note 3 for further discussion of our master netting agreements.\nThe majority of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain specified issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings. Should our ratings fall below these specified levels, we would be in violation of the provisions, and our derivatives counterparties could terminate our contracts and request immediate payment. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position was $59.7 million and $34.6 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments - Continued\nDerivative Transactions\nThe table below summarizes, by notional amounts, the activity for each category of derivatives. The notional amounts represent the basis upon which our counterparty pay and receive amounts are calculated.\nCash Flow Hedges\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $210.2 million and $213.5 million, respectively, notional amount of receive fixed, pay fixed, open current and forward foreign currency interest rate swaps to hedge fixed income foreign currency-denominated securities.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, in connection with the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction, we reclassified $30.7 million of deferred gains from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings included in the net realized investment gain line item on our income statement. The deferred gains were related to previously terminated interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments of fixed maturity securities in the Closed Block individual disability product line. See Note 12 for further discussion.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we entered into a $350.0 million notional forward benchmark interest rate lock in order to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the cash flows related to the tender offer and early redemption of certain of our debt securities. We terminated the interest rate lock during 2019 and recognized a loss of $0.5 million that was reported with the $5.3 million tender premium as a cost related to the early retirement of debt in our statement of income. See Note 8 for further discussion of the tender offer and early redemption of certain of our debt securities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we expect to amortize approximately $60.3 million of net deferred gains on derivative instruments during the next twelve months. This amount will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings and reported on the same income statement line item as the hedged item. The income statement line items that will be affected by this amortization are net investment income and interest and debt expense. Additional amounts that may be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings to offset the earnings impact of foreign currency translation of hedged items are not estimable.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we are hedging the variability of future cash flows associated with forecasted transactions through the year 2045.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments - Continued\nFair Value Hedges\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $362.4 million and $249.4 million notional amount of receive fixed, pay fixed, open current and forward foreign currency interest rate swaps to hedge fixed income foreign currency-denominated securities.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $250.0 million notional amount of receive fixed, pay variable interest rate swaps to hedge the changes in the fair value of certain fixed rate long-term debt which matured in the third quarter of 2020 along with the hedged debt. These swaps effectively converted the associated fixed rate long-term debt into floating rate debt and provided for a better matching of interest rates with our short-term investments, which have frequent interest rate resets similar to a floating rate security.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying amount of hedged assets and liabilities and the related cumulative basis adjustments related to our fair value hedges:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, $(1.8) million, $2.0 million, and $2.5 million respectively, of the derivative instruments' gain (loss) was excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. There were no instances wherein we discontinued fair value hedge accounting due to a hedged firm commitment no longer qualifying as a fair value hedge.\nDerivatives not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we held $148.2 million notional amount of receive fixed, pay fixed, foreign currency interest rate swaps. These derivatives are not designated as hedges, and as such, changes in fair value related to these derivatives are reported in earnings as a component of net realized investment gain or loss.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we held $11.7 million and $11.4 million, respectively, notional amount of single name credit default swaps. We entered into these swaps in order to mitigate the credit risk associated with specific securities owned.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we held $11.9 million and $8.9 million, respectively, notional amount of foreign currency forwards to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with specific securities owned.\nWe have an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement for which we include in our realized investment gains and losses a calculation intended to estimate the value of the option of our reinsurance counterparty to cancel the reinsurance contract with us. However, neither party can unilaterally terminate the reinsurance agreement except in extreme circumstances resulting from regulatory supervision, delinquency proceedings, or other direct regulatory action. Cash settlements or collateral related to this embedded derivative are not required at any time during the reinsurance contract or at termination of the reinsurance contract. There are no credit-related counterparty triggers, and any accumulated embedded derivative gain or loss reduces to zero over time as the reinsured business winds down.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments - Continued\nLocations and Amounts of Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe following tables summarize the location and fair values of derivative financial instruments, as reported in our consolidated balance sheets.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments - Continued\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments - Continued\nThe following tables summarize the location of gains and losses of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments, as reported in our consolidated statements of income.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments - Continued\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments - Continued\nThe following table summarizes the location of gains and losses of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedging instruments, as reported in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments - Continued\nThe following table summarizes the location of gains and losses on our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, as reported in our consolidated statements of income.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 5 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nComponents of our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), after tax, and related changes are as follows:\nThe net unrealized gain (loss) on securities consists of the following components:\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 5 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) - Continued\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were recognized in our consolidated statements of income as follows:\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 6 - Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\nChanges in the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses are as follows:\nThe majority of the net balances are related to disability claims with long-tail payouts on which interest earned on assets backing liabilities is an integral part of pricing and reserving. Interest accrued on prior year reserves has been calculated on the opening reserve balance less one-half of the year\u2019s claim payments relative to prior years at our average reserve discount rate for the respective periods.\n\"Incurred Related to Prior Years - All Other Incurred\" shown in the preceding chart includes the increase in benefits and change in reserves for future benefits resulting from the realization of previously unrealized investment gains and losses as a result of the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance agreement and reserve adjustments as discussed in the following paragraphs, which impact the comparability between the years presented. Excluding those adjustments, the variability exhibited year over year is primarily caused by the level of claim resolutions in the period relative to the long-term expectations reflected in the reserves. Our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period, both favorably and unfavorably.\nClosed Block Individual Disability Reinsurance Transaction\nIn connection with the first phase of the Closed Block individual disability coinsurance agreement that closed in December 2020, we recorded a reinsurance recoverable of $6,141.5 million representing the ceded reserves related to the cohort of policies on claim status as of July 1, 2020 (DLR cohort) and an increase in benefits and change in reserves for future benefits of $1,284.5 million resulting from the realization of previously unrealized investment gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. These impacts are reflected in the chart shown above and the reconciliation shown below.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 6 - Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses\n2020 Long-term Care Reserve Increase\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed a review of policy reserve adequacy, which incorporated our most recent experience and included a review of all material assumptions. Based on our analysis, during the fourth quarter of 2020, we updated our interest rate and premium rate increase reserve assumptions and determined that our gross long-term care policy and claim reserves should be increased by $151.5 million, of which $7.0 million was related to our liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses, which can be primarily attributed to prior year incurred claims, thereby impacting the results shown in the preceding chart.\n2018 Long-term Care Reserve Increase\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we completed our annual review of policy reserve adequacy, which incorporated our most recent experience and included a review of all assumptions. Based on our analysis, during the third quarter of 2018, we updated our reserve assumptions and determined that our policy and claim reserves should be increased by $750.8 million of which, approximately $236 million was related to our liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses, which can be primarily attributed to prior year incurred claims, thereby impacting the results shown in the preceding chart.\nReconciliation\nA reconciliation of policy and contract benefits and reserves for future policy and contract benefits as reported in our consolidated balance sheets to the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses is as follows:\nThe adjustment related to unrealized investment gains and losses reflects the changes that would be necessary to policyholder liabilities if the unrealized investment gains and losses related to the corresponding available-for-sale securities had been realized. Changes in this adjustment are reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 7 - Income Tax\nTotal income tax expense (benefit) is allocated as follows:\nA reconciliation of the income tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory rate to the income tax rate as reported in our consolidated statements of income is as follows:\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 7 - Income Tax - Continued\nOur net deferred tax asset (liability) consists of the following. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year reporting.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 7 - Income Tax - Continued\nOur consolidated statements of income include amounts subject to both domestic and foreign taxation. The income and related tax expense (benefit) are as follows:\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Federal government enacted the TCJA, which reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. The Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) allowing a one-year measurement period after the enactment date of TCJA to finalize the calculation and record the related tax impacts. We finalized and recorded adjustments to our initial estimates during 2018. As a result of guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), we recorded additional deemed repatriation transition tax on accumulated foreign E&P of $11.5 million, for a total of $77.9 million. We recorded no other material changes to our calculations of the impact of the TCJA during the one-year measurement period after the enactment period as allowed by SAB 118. In 2020, we recorded a tax benefit of $36.5 million for 2020 tax losses that will be carried back to a 35 percent tax year pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).\nOn July 22, 2020, the Finance Bill 2019-21 was enacted, resulting in a U.K. tax rate increase from 17 percent to 19 percent, retroactively effective April 1, 2020, which resulted in tax expense of $9.3 million for the revaluation of our tax assets and liabilities, primarily deferred tax liabilities related to policyholder reserves. As of December 31, 2020, our plans for the future repatriations of cash from our foreign subsidiaries can include no more than the amount of capital above that which is required by U.K. regulatory capital requirements. The remainder of our investment in our foreign subsidiaries is indefinitely reinvested and we have not recorded any deferred taxes on the approximately $0.7 billion of the excess of the U.S. GAAP carrying values over the tax basis of investments in our foreign subsidiaries.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 7 - Income Tax - Continued\nOur consolidated statements of income include the following changes in unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn 2018, we recorded $261.1 million gross unrecognized tax benefits for a policyholder reserves position taken on our 2017 federal tax return, which if recognized, would decrease our tax expense by $112.9 million. The balances of unrecognized tax benefits for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility are $105.9 million at December 31, 2020, $127.1 million at December 31, 2019, and $148.2 million at December 31, 2018. It is reasonably possible that this item could reverse in the next 12 months following review by the IRS. We recognize interest expense and penalties, if applicable, related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. We recognized $7.8 million and $12.8 million of interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits during 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a de minimis amount in 2018. The liability for net interest expense on uncertain tax positions was approximately $20.6 million and $12.8 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a de minimis amount in 2018.\nWe file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Tax years subsequent to 2014 remain subject to examination by the IRS. Tax years subsequent to 2016 remain subject to examination by the IRS for the subsidiaries not included in the consolidated tax return. All other major foreign jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years subsequent to 2018 with the exception of Poland for which tax years subsequent to 2014 remain subject to examination. We believe sufficient provision has been made for all potential adjustments for years that are not closed by the statute of limitations in all major tax jurisdictions and that any such adjustments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.\nWe file state income tax returns in nearly every state in the United States. Tax years subsequent to 2015 remain subject to examination depending on the statute of limitation established by the various states, which is generally three to four years.\nWe have no accumulated federal net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2020. Our federal capital loss carryforward, related to subsidiaries not included in the consolidated U.S. federal return, was $0.6 million at December 31, 2020 and is expected to be utilized by the time it expires in 2022. We have net operating loss carryforwards for state and local income tax of approximately $191 million, most of which is expected to expire unused between 2021 and 2040.\nWe record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Our valuation allowance was $14.5 million and $28.3 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the majority of which related to our cumulative deferred state income tax benefits. The de minimis remaining amount of our valuation allowance relates to unrealized tax losses on buildings which we own and occupy in the U.K. We recorded a decrease in our valuation allowance of $13.8 million during 2020 and an increase of $9.9 million in 2019, primarily in other comprehensive income.\nTotal income taxes paid net of refunds during 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $200.0 million, $35.1 million, and $139.7 million, respectively.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 8 - Debt\nDebt consists of the following:\nCollateralized debt is comprised of our senior secured notes and ranks highest in priority, followed by unsecured notes, which consist of senior notes and medium-term notes, followed by junior subordinated debt securities. The medium-term notes are non-callable and the junior subordinated debt securities are callable under limited, specified circumstances. The remaining debt is callable and may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time.\nThe aggregate contractual principal maturities are $2.0 million in 2023, $350.0 million in 2024, $775.0 million in 2025, and $2,247.5 million thereafter.\nSenior Secured Notes\nIn 2007, Northwind Holdings, LLC (Northwind Holdings), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unum Group, issued $800.0 million of insured, senior secured notes, bearing interest at a floating rate equal to the three month LIBOR plus 0.78% (the Northwind notes) in a private offering.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 8 - Debt - Continued\nNorthwind Holdings made periodic principal payments on the Northwind notes of $45.0 million in 2020 and $60.0 million in both 2019 and 2018. In December 2020, Northwind Holdings redeemed the remaining $35.0 million of principal on the Northwind notes, and was released of any contractual collateral requirements.\nUnsecured Notes\nIn September 2020, our $400.0 million 5.625% senior unsecured notes matured.\nIn May 2020, we issued $500.0 million of 4.500% senior notes due 2025. The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.\nDuring 2019 we purchased and retired (i) $30.3 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.190% medium-term notes due 2028; (ii) $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.250% senior notes due 2028; and (iii) $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.000% senior notes due 2021.\nIn September 2019, we issued $450.0 million of 4.500% senior notes due 2049. The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.\nIn June 2019, we issued $400.0 million of 4.000% senior notes due 2029. The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.\nIn July 2018, our $200.0 million 7.000% senior unsecured notes matured.\nFair Value Hedges\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $250.0 million notional amount of an interest rate swap which effectively converted certain of our unsecured senior notes into floating rate debt. Under this agreement, we received a fixed rate of interest and paid a variable rate of interest, based off of three-month LIBOR. During 2020, the $250.0 million notional amount of the interest rate swap matured in conjunction with the maturity of the hedged debt. See Note 4 for further information on the interest rate swap.\nJunior Subordinated Debt Securities\nIn May 2018, we issued $300.0 million of 6.250% junior subordinated notes due 2058. The notes are redeemable at or above par on or after June 15, 2023 and rank equally in the right of payment with our other junior subordinated debt securities.\nIn 1998, Provident Financing Trust I (the Trust), a 100 percent-owned finance subsidiary of Unum Group, issued $300.0 million of 7.405% capital securities due 2038 in a public offering. These capital securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Unum Group, have a liquidation value of $1,000 per capital security, and have a mandatory redemption feature under certain circumstances. In connection with the capital securities offering, Unum Group issued to the Trust 7.405% junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures due 2038. The Trust is a variable interest entity of which Unum Group is not the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the capital securities issued by the Trust are not included in our consolidated financial statements and our liability represents the junior subordinated debt securities owed to the trust which is recorded in long-term debt. The sole assets of the Trust are the junior subordinated debt securities. The retirement of any liquidation amount regarding the capital securities by the Trust results in a corresponding retirement of principal amount of the junior subordinated debt securities.\nDuring 2019, the Trust purchased and retired $22.8 million aggregate liquidation amount of the 7.405% capital securities due 2038, which resulted in our purchase and retirement of a corresponding principal amount of our 7.405% junior subordinated debt securities due 2038.\nCost Related to Early Retirement of Debt\nDuring 2019, we incurred costs of $27.3 million related to the early retirement of certain of our unsecured notes and junior subordinated debt securities as previously discussed.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 8 - Debt - Continued\nInterest Paid\nInterest paid on long-term and short-term debt and related securities during 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $178.1 million, $172.9 million, and $167.3 million, respectively.\nCredit Facilities\nWe have access to two separate unsecured revolving credit facilities, each with a different syndicate of lenders. One of our credit facilities is under a five-year agreement and is effective through April 2024. The terms of this agreement provide for a borrowing capacity of $500.0 million with an option to be increased up to $700.0 million. We may also request, on up to two occasions, that the lenders' commitment termination dates be extended by one year. The credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit subject to certain terms and limitations. At December 31, 2020, letters of credit totaling $0.6 million had been issued from this credit facility, but there were no borrowed amounts outstanding.\nOur other credit facility is under a three-year agreement and is effective until April 2022. The terms of this agreement provide for a borrowing capacity of $100.0 million with an option to be increased up to $140.0 million. We may also request that the lenders' commitment termination dates be extended by one year. The credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit subject to certain terms and limitations. At December 31, 2020, there have been no letters of credit issued from the credit facility and there were no borrowed amounts outstanding.\nBorrowings under the credit facilities are for general corporate uses and are subject to financial covenants, negative covenants, and events of default that are customary. The two primary financial covenants include limitations based on our leverage ratio and consolidated net worth. We are also subject to covenants that limit subsidiary indebtedness. The credit facilities provide for borrowings at an interest rate based either on the prime rate or LIBOR.\nNote 9 - Employee Benefit Plans\nDefined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit (OPEB) Plans\nWe sponsor several defined benefit pension and OPEB plans for our employees, including non-qualified pension plans. The U.S. qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans comprise the majority of our total benefit obligation and benefit cost. We maintain a separate defined benefit plan for eligible employees in our U.K. operation. The U.S. defined benefit pension plans were closed to new entrants on December 31, 2013, the OPEB plan was closed to new entrants on December 31, 2012, and the U.K. plan was closed to new entrants on December 31, 2002.\nU.S. Pension Plan Annuity Purchases\nOn December 26, 2019, we purchased a group annuity contract which transferred a portion of our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan obligation to a third party. Under the transaction, which was funded with plan assets, we transferred the responsibility for pension benefits and annuity administration for approximately 1,900 retirees or their beneficiaries receiving less than $350 in monthly benefit payments from the plan. This transfer resulted in a reduction in our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan obligation of $59.5 million at December 31, 2019 and is reflected in the Benefits and Expenses Paid line item within the following table regarding changes in our benefit obligation.\nOn January 2, 2020, in a separate transaction, we purchased a second group annuity contract which transferred an additional portion of our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan obligation to the same third party. Under the transaction, which was funded with plan assets, we transferred the responsibility for pension benefits and annuity administration for approximately 600 retirees or their beneficiaries receiving between $350 and $500 in monthly benefit payments from the plan. This transfer resulted in a reduction in our U.S. qualified benefit pension plan obligation of $44.0 million at December 31, 2020 and is reflected in the Benefits and Expenses Paid line item within the following table regarding changes in our benefit obligation.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 9 - Employee Benefit Plans - Continued\nAmortization Period of Actuarial Gain or Loss and Prior Service Cost or Credit\nBecause all participants in the U.S. and U.K. pension plans are considered inactive, we amortize the net actuarial loss and prior service credit for these plans over the average remaining life expectancy of the plans. As of December 31, 2020, the estimate of the average remaining life expectancy of the plans was approximately 25 years for the U.S. plan and 31 years for U.K. plan.\nThe following table provides the changes in the benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets and the funded status of the plans.\n(1) The actuarial losses recognized for the U.S. and U.K. pension plans were primarily driven by decreases in the discount rate assumption.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 9 - Employee Benefit Plans - Continued\nThe amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets for our pension and OPEB plans at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows.\nThe following table provides the changes recognized in other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nPlan Assets\nThe objective of our U.S. pension and OPEB plans is to maximize long-term return, within acceptable risk levels, in a manner that is consistent with the fiduciary standards of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), while maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and expenses.\nOur U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan assets include a diversified blend of domestic, international, global, and emerging market equity securities, fixed income securities, opportunistic credit securities, real estate investments, alternative investments, and cash equivalents. Equity securities are comprised of funds and individual securities that are benchmarked against the respective indices specified below. International and global equity funds may allocate a certain percentage of assets to forward currency contracts. Fixed income securities include U.S. government and agency asset-backed securities, corporate investment-grade bonds, private placement securities, and bonds issued by states or other municipalities. Opportunistic credits consist of investments in funds that hold varied fixed income investments purchased at depressed values with the intention to\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 9 - Employee Benefit Plans - Continued\nlater sell those investments for a gain. Real estate investments consist primarily of funds that hold commercial real estate investments. Alternative investments, which include private equity direct investments, private equity funds of funds, and hedge funds of funds, utilize proprietary strategies that are intended to have a low correlation to the U.S. stock market. Prohibited investments include, but are not limited to, unlisted securities, options, short sales, and investments in securities issued by Unum Group or its affiliates. The invested asset classes, asset types, and benchmark indices for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan is as follows. We target approximately 36 percent to equity securities, 40 percent to fixed income securities, and 24 percent to opportunistic credits, alternative, and real estate investments.\nAssets for our U.K. pension plan are primarily invested in a pooled diversified growth fund. This fund invests in assets such as global equities, hedge funds, commodities, below-investment-grade fixed income securities, and currencies. The objectives of the fund are to generate capital appreciation over the course of a complete economic and market cycle and to deliver equity-like returns in the medium-to-long term while maintaining approximately two thirds of the volatility of equity markets. Performance of this fund is measured against LIBOR plus four and a half percent. The remaining assets in the U.K. plan are invested in leveraged interest rate and inflation gilt funds of varying durations designed to broadly match the interest rate and inflation sensitivities of the plan's liabilities. The current target allocation for the assets is 65 percent diversified growth assets and 35 percent interest rate and inflation gilt funds. There are no categories of investments that are specifically prohibited by the U.K. plan, but there are general guidelines that ensure prudent investment action is taken. Such guidelines include the prevention of the plan from using derivatives for speculative purposes and limiting the concentration of risk in any one type of investment.\nAssets for the OPEB plan are invested in life insurance contracts issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries. The assets support life insurance benefits payable to certain former retirees covered under the OPEB plan. The terms of these contracts are consistent in all material respects with those the subsidiary offers to unaffiliated parties that are similarly situated. There are no categories of investments specifically prohibited by the OPEB plan.\nWe believe our investment portfolios are well diversified by asset class and sector, with no undue risk concentrations in any one category.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 9 - Employee Benefit Plans - Continued\nThe categorization of fair value measurements by input level for the invested assets in our U.S. pension plans is shown below. The carrying values of investment-related receivables and payables approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of the securities and are not included in the following chart. Investments valued using net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient are not required to be categorized by input level, but these investments are included as follows to reconcile to total invested assets.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 9 - Employee Benefit Plans - Continued\nLevel 1 investments consist of individual holdings that are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices from active markets for identical securities. Level 2 investments consist of individual holdings that are valued using observable inputs through market corroborated pricing.\nCertain equity, opportunistic credit, and real estate investments are valued based on the NAV of the underlying holdings. We made no adjustments to the NAV for 2020 or 2019. These investments have no unfunded commitments and no specific redemption restrictions.\nAlternative investments are valued based on NAV in a period ranging from one month to one quarter in arrears. We evaluate the need for adjustments to the NAV based on market conditions and discussions with fund managers in the period subsequent to the valuation date and prior to issuance of the financial statements. We made no adjustments to the NAV for 2020 or 2019. The private equity direct investments and private equity funds of funds generally cannot be redeemed by investors. Distributions of capital from the sale of underlying fund assets may occur at any time, but are generally concentrated between five and eight years from the formation of the fund.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 9 - Employee Benefit Plans - Continued\nThe categorization of fair value measurements by input level for the invested assets in our U.K. pension plan is shown below. Investments valued using NAV as a practical expedient are not required to be categorized by input level, but these investments are included as follows to reconcile to total invested assets.\nLevel 1 fixed interest and index-linked securities consist of individual funds that are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices from active markets for identical securities. Diversified growth assets are valued based on the NAV of the underlying holdings. We made no adjustments to the NAV for 2020 or 2019. These investments have no unfunded commitments and no specific redemption restrictions.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 9 - Employee Benefit Plans - Continued\nThe categorization of fair value measurements by input level for the assets in our OPEB plan is as follows:\nThe fair value is represented by the actuarial present value of future cash flows of the contracts.\nChanges in our OPEB plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the actual return on plan assets relates solely to investments still held at the reporting date. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 during 2020 or 2019.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 9 - Employee Benefit Plans - Continued\nMeasurement Assumptions\nWe use a December 31 measurement date for each of our plans. The weighted average assumptions used in the measurement of our benefit obligations as of December 31 and our net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31 are as follows:\nWe set the discount rate assumption annually for each of our retirement-related benefit plans at the measurement date to reflect the yield on a portfolio of high quality fixed income corporate debt instruments matched against the projected cash flows for future benefits.\nOur long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is selected from a range of probable return outcomes from an analysis of the asset portfolio. Our expectations for the future investment returns of the asset categories are based on a combination of historical market performance, evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists, and current market yields. The methodology underlying the return assumption includes the various elements of the expected return for each asset class such as long-term rates of return, volatility of returns, and the correlation of returns between various asset classes. The expected return for the total portfolio is calculated based on the plan's strategic asset allocation. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews. Risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.\nOur mortality rate assumption reflects our best estimate, as of the measurement date, of the life expectancies of plan participants in order to determine the expected length of time for benefit payments. We derive our assumptions from industry mortality tables.\nThe expected return assumption for the life insurance reserve for our OPEB plan is based on full investment in fixed income securities with an average book yield of 4.87 percent and 4.74 percent in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe rate of compensation increase assumption for our U.K. pension plan is generally based on periodic studies of compensation trends.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered postretirement health care benefits assumed for the next calendar year are 6.50 percent for benefits payable to both retirees prior to Medicare eligibility as well as Medicare eligible retirees. The rates are assumed to change gradually to 5.00 percent by 2027 for measurement at December 31, 2020 and remain at that level thereafter. The annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered postretirement health benefits do not apply to retirees whose postretirement health care benefits are provided through an exchange.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 9 - Employee Benefit Plans - Continued\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost\nThe following table provides the components of the net periodic benefit cost (credit) for the years ended December 31.\nThe service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost is included as a component of compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income. All other components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost are included in other expenses.\nBenefit Payments\nThe following table provides expected benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate.\nFunding Policy\nThe funding policy for our U.S. qualified defined benefit plan is to contribute annually an amount at least equal to the minimum annual contribution required under ERISA and other applicable laws, but generally not greater than the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. We had no regulatory contribution requirements for our U.S. qualified defined benefit plan in 2020 and made a de minimis amount of voluntary contributions during 2020. We do not expect to make any contributions in 2021. The funding policy for our U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plan is to contribute the amount of the benefit payments made during the year. Our expected return on plan assets and discount rate will not affect the cash contributions we are required to make to our U.S. pension plan because such contributions are determined under the minimum funding requirements as set forth in ERISA.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 9 - Employee Benefit Plans - Continued\nWe made no contributions to our U.K. plan during 2020, nor do we expect to make any contributions in 2021, either voluntary or those required to meet the minimum funding requirements under U.K. legislation.\nOur OPEB plan represents a non-vested, non-guaranteed obligation, and current regulations do not require specific funding levels for these benefits, which are comprised of retiree life, medical, and dental benefits. It is our practice to use general assets to pay medical and dental claims as they come due in lieu of utilizing plan assets for the medical and dental benefit portions of our OPEB plan.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe offer a 401(k) plan to all eligible U.S. employees under which a portion of employee contributions is matched. We match dollar-for-dollar up to 5.0 percent of base salary and any recognized sales and performance-based incentive compensation for employee contributions into the plan. We also make an additional non-elective contribution of 4.5 percent of earnings for all eligible employees and a separate transition contribution for eligible employees who met certain age and years of service criteria as of December 31, 2013. The separate transition contributions continued through December 31, 2020, at which point they expired. The 401(k) plan remains in compliance with ERISA guidelines and continues to qualify for a \u201csafe harbor\u201d from annual discrimination testing.\nWe also offer a defined contribution plan to all eligible U.K. employees under which a portion of employee contributions is matched. We match two pounds for every one pound on the first 1.0 percent of employee contributions into the plan and match additional employee contributions pound-for-pound up to 5.0 percent of base salary. We also make an additional non-elective contribution of 6.0 percent of base salary for all eligible employees who met certain age and years of service criteria as of March 31, 2016.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we recognized costs of $83.4 million, $77.3 million, and $72.7 million, respectively, for our U.S. defined contribution plan. We recognized costs of $5.0 million, $4.4 million, and $4.2 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, for our U.K. defined contribution plan.\nNote 10 - Stockholders' Equity and Earnings Per Common Share\nEarnings Per Common Share\nNet income per common share is determined as follows:\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 10 - Stockholders' Equity and Earnings Per Common Share - Continued\nWe compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In computing earnings per share assuming dilution, we include potential common shares that are dilutive (those that reduce earnings per share). We use the treasury stock method to account for the effect of outstanding stock options, nonvested stock success units, nonvested restricted stock units, and nonvested performance share units on the computation of diluted earnings per share. Under this method, the potential common shares from stock options, nonvested stock success units, and nonvested restricted stock units will each have a dilutive effect, as individually measured, when the average market price of Unum Group common stock during the period exceeds the exercise price of the stock options and the grant price of the nonvested stock success units and nonvested restricted stock units. Potential common shares from performance based share units will have a dilutive effect as the attainment of performance conditions is progressively achieved during the vesting period. Potential common shares not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the impact would be antidilutive, approximated 1.6 million, 1.1 million, and 0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. See Note 11 for further discussion of our stock-based compensation plans.\nCommon Stock\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750.0 million of Unum Group's outstanding common stock through November 23, 2020, at which point the authorization expired. This authorization replaced the previous authorization of $750.0 million that was scheduled to expire on November 24, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we did not authorize a new share repurchase program and there were no remaining amounts to be repurchased under either plan at December 31, 2020.\nCommon stock repurchases, which are accounted for using the cost method and classified as treasury stock until otherwise retired, were as follows:\n(1) Includes commissions of $0.4 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPreferred Stock\nUnum Group has 25.0 million shares of preferred stock authorized with a par value of $0.10 per share. No preferred stock has been issued to date.\nNote 11 - Stock-Based Compensation\nDescription of Stock Plans\nUnder the Stock Incentive Plan of 2017 (the 2017 Plan), up to 17 million shares of common stock are available for awards to our employees, officers, consultants, and directors. Awards may be in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units, and other stock-based awards. Each full-value award, defined as any award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right, is counted as 1.76 shares. The exercise price for stock options issued cannot be less than the fair value of the underlying common stock as of the grant date. Stock options generally have a term of eight years after the date of grant and fully vest after three years. At December 31, 2020, approximately 10.1 million shares were available for future grants under the 2017 Plan.\nUnder the Stock Incentive Plan of 2012 (the 2012 Plan), which was terminated in May 2017 for the purposes of any further grants, up to 20 million shares of common stock were available for awards to our employees, officers, consultants, and directors. Awards could be in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units, and other stock-based awards. Each full-value award, defined as any award other than a stock option or stock appreciation\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 11 - Stock-Based Compensation - Continued\nright, is counted as 1.76 shares. Awards granted before the termination of the 2012 Plan remain outstanding in accordance with the plan's terms. Stock options generally have a term of eight years after the date of grant and fully vest after three years.\nWe issue new shares of common stock for all of our stock plan vestings and exercises.\nStock Success Units (SSUs)\nActivity for SSUs classified as equity is as follows:\nDuring 2020, we issued SSUs with a weighted average grant date fair value per share of $18.78. SSUs vest over a six year period, beginning at the date of grant, and the compensation cost is recognized ratably during the vesting period. SSUs are eligible for accelerated vesting at the end of the first, third, and fifth years of the service period if certain performance goals are achieved. Forfeitable dividends on SSUs are accrued in the form of cash. Compensation cost for SSUs subject to accelerated vesting due to the achievement of certain performance conditions at the end of the first, third, and fifth years of the service period is recognized over the implicit service period.\nThere were no shares that vested during 2020. At December 31, 2020, we had $5.7 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to SSUs that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.9 years.\nPerformance Share Units (PSUs)\nActivity for PSUs classified as equity is as follows:\nDuring 2020, 2019, and 2018, we issued PSUs with a weighted average grant date fair value per share of $23.49, $41.57, and $44.19, respectively. Vesting for the PSUs occurs at the end of a three-year period and is contingent upon our achievement of prospective company performance goals and our total shareholder return relative to a board-approved peer group during the three-year period. Actual performance, including modification for relative total shareholder return, may result in the ultimate award of 40 to 180 percent of the initial number of PSUs issued, with the potential for no award if company performance goals are not achieved during the three-year period. Forfeitable dividend equivalents on PSUs have previously been accrued in the form of additional PSUs. Beginning with the March 1, 2020 grant, forfeitable dividends are accrued as cash.\nPSU shares in the preceding table represent aggregate initial target awards and accrued dividend equivalents and do not reflect potential increases or decreases resulting from the application of the performance factor determined after the end of the performance periods. At December 31, 2020, the three-year performance period for the 2018 PSU grant was completed and the related shares vested, but the performance factor had not yet been applied. The performance factor will be applied during the first quarter of 2021, with distribution of the stock at that time. Granted and vested amounts in the preceding table also include\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 11 - Stock-Based Compensation - Continued\nan adjustment to reflect the application of the performance factor to the 2017 PSU grant, which occurred during the first quarter of 2020.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had approximately $6.5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to PSUs that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 years. The estimated compensation expense is adjusted for actual performance experience and is recognized ratably during the service period, or remaining service period, if and when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be satisfied. Compensation cost for PSUs subject to accelerated vesting at the date of retirement eligibility is recognized over the implicit service period.\nThe fair value of PSUs is estimated on the date of initial grant using the Monte-Carlo simulation model. Key assumptions used to value PSUs granted during the years shown are as follows:\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs)\nActivity for RSUs classified as equity is as follows:\nDuring 2020, 2019, and 2018, we issued RSUs with a weighted average grant date fair value per share of $22.71, $37.07, and $47.76, respectively. RSUs vest over a one to three-year service period, beginning at the date of grant, and the compensation cost is recognized ratably during the vesting period. Forfeitable dividend equivalents on RSUs have previously been accrued in the form of additional RSUs. Beginning with the March 1, 2020 grant, forfeitable dividends are accrued as cash. Compensation cost for RSUs subject to accelerated vesting at the date of retirement eligibility is recognized over the implicit service period.\nThe total fair value of shares vested during 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $25.1 million, $19.5 million, and $18.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 2020, we had $21.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.9 years.\nCash-Settled RSUs\nActivity for cash-settled RSUs classified as a liability is as follows:\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 11 - Stock-Based Compensation - Continued\nCash-settled RSUs vest over a one to three-year service period, beginning at the date of grant, and the compensation cost is recognized ratably during the vesting period. Forfeitable dividends on cash-settled RSUs are accrued in the form of cash. Compensation cost for cash-settled RSUs subject to accelerated vesting at the date of retirement eligibility is recognized over the implicit service period.\nThe amount payable per unit awarded is equal to the price per share of Unum Group's common stock at settlement of the award, and as such, we measure the value of the award each reporting period based on the current stock price. The effects of changes in the stock price during the service period are recognized as compensation cost over the service period. Changes in the amount of the liability due to stock price changes after the service period are recognized as compensation cost during the period in which the changes occur. At December 31, 2020, we had $1.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to cash-settled RSUs that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.1 years.\nThe cash-settled RSUs have a weighted average grant date fair value per unit granted of $22.94. As of December 31, 2020, no amount of cash-settled RSUs have vested or been paid.\nStock Options\nStock option activity is summarized as follows:\nAll outstanding stock options at December 31, 2020 have vested. Stock options vest over a one to three-year service period, beginning at the date of grant, and the compensation cost is recognized ratably during the vesting period. Compensation cost for stock options subject to accelerated vesting at the date of retirement eligibility is recognized over the implicit service period. At December 31, 2020, we had no unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options.\nThe intrinsic value of options exercised in 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $0.1 million, $0.3 million, and $0.7 million, respectively. There were no stock options granted or vested in the years 2018 through 2020.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 11 - Stock-Based Compensation - Continued\nExpense\nCompensation expense for the stock plans, as reported in our consolidated statements of income, is as follows:\nCash received under all share-based payment arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $4.4 million, $6.1 million, and $4.6 million, respectively.\nNote 12 - Reinsurance\nReinsurance activity related to both our premium income and changes in reserves for future benefits are as follows:\nEffective December 16, 2020, Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company, The Paul Revere Life Insurance Company and Unum Life Insurance Company of America, wholly-owned domestic insurance subsidiaries of Unum Group and collectively referred to as \"the ceding companies\", entered into a series of agreements (collectively referred to as the \"reinsurance agreement\") with Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company (Commonwealth), a subsidiary of Global Atlantic Financial Group, to reinsure on a coinsurance basis effective as of July 1, 2020 approximately 75 percent of the Closed Block individual disability business, primarily direct business written by the ceding companies. Commonwealth has established and will maintain collateralized trust accounts for the benefit of the ceding companies to secure its obligations under the relevant reinsurance agreement. As part of the agreement, additional Closed Block individual disability business consisting of direct business not ceded in December 2020 and business assumed by the ceding companies from third parties, is expected to be reinsured in the first quarter of 2021, subject to receipt of required consents and regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions and is considered the second phase of this transaction. In connection with the first phase of the coinsurance agreement that closed in December 2020, the ceding companies paid a total cash ceding commission to Commonwealth of approximately $438 million and transferred additional assets consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities and cash totaling $6,669.8 million.\nIn December 2020, Provident Life and Casualty Insurance Company (PLC), also a wholly-owned domestic insurance subsidiary of Unum Group, entered into an agreement with Commonwealth whereby PLC will provide a 12-year volatility cover to\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 12 - Reinsurance - Continued\nCommonwealth for the active life cohort (ALR cohort), which represents approximately five percent of the reserves ceded to Commonwealth. As part of this agreement, PLC received a payment from Commonwealth of approximately $62 million. PLC will provide similar coverage to Commonwealth related to additional business ceded as part of the second phase of the transaction. At the end of the 12-year coverage period, Commonwealth will retain the remaining incidence and claims risk on the ALR cohort of the ceded business. Under this volatility cover, annual settlements will be made equal to the difference between the actual and estimated cash flows and reserve changes during the year. Upon expiration of the 12-year period, a terminal settlement will be made based on the final disabled life reserves. As a result of the volatility cover, the reinsurance agreement covering the ALR cohort, does not pass risk transfer requirements under GAAP and is accounted for under the deposit method.\nAs a result of this reinsurance agreement, we recognized the following as of the date of the agreement:\n\u2022Net realized investment gains totaling $1,302.3 million related to the transfer of investments.\n\u2022Increase in benefits and change in reserves for future benefits of $1,284.5 million resulting from the realization of previously unrealized investment gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.\n\u2022Transaction costs totaling $21.0 million.\n\u2022Tax benefit of $36.5 million.\n\u2022Reinsurance recoverable of $6,141.5 million representing the ceded reserves related to policies on claim status (DLR cohort).\n\u2022Cost of reinsurance, or the prepaid reinsurance premium, of $815.7 million related to the DLR cohort.\n\u2022Deposit asset of $88.2 million related to the ALR cohort.\nThe cost of reinsurance will be amortized over the expected run-off pattern of the ceded reserves for the DLR cohort and we recognized $2.6 million in amortization expense in 2020 subsequent to the execution of the agreement. The deposit asset will be adjusted over the 12-year period of the volatility cover based on cash flows related to the ALR cohort, settlement payments as determined above, and accretion of interest and will result in an amount equal to the expected disabled life reserve for the ALR cohort at the expiration of the volatility cover. Both the cost of reinsurance and the deposit asset are reported in Other Assets within our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Commonwealth accounted for approximately 59 percent of the total reinsurance recoverable and the majority of our total cost of reinsurance. Commonwealth has an A rating by A.M. Best Company (AM Best) and has also established collateralized trust accounts for our benefit to secure its obligations. In addition, nine other major companies, which account for approximately 35 percent of our reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2020, are also rated A or better by either AM Best or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P), or are fully securitized by letters of credit or investment-grade fixed maturity securities held in trust. Approximately five percent of our reinsurance recoverable relates to business reinsured either with companies rated A- or better by AM Best or S&P, with overseas entities with equivalent ratings, or backed by letters of credit or trust agreements, or through reinsurance arrangements wherein we retain the assets in our general account. The remaining one percent of our reinsurance recoverable is held by companies either rated below A- by AM Best or S&P, or not rated.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 13 - Segment Information\nWe have three principal operating business segments: Unum US, Unum International, and Colonial Life. Our other segments are Closed Block and Corporate.\nThe Unum US segment is comprised of group long-term and short-term disability insurance, which includes our medical stop-loss product as well as our fee-based leave management services and ASO business, group life and accidental death and dismemberment products, and supplemental and voluntary lines of business, which are comprised of individual disability, voluntary benefits, and dental and vision products. These products are marketed through our field sales personnel who work in conjunction with independent brokers and consultants.\nThe Unum International segment is comprised of our operations in both the United Kingdom and Poland. Our Unum UK products include insurance for group long-term disability, group life, and supplemental lines of business which include dental, individual disability, and critical illness products. Our Unum Poland products include insurance for individual and group life with accident and health riders. Unum International's products are sold primarily through field sales personnel and independent brokers and consultants.\nThe Colonial Life segment includes insurance for accident, sickness, and disability products, which includes our dental and vision products, life products, and cancer and critical illness products marketed to employees, on both a group and an individual basis, at the workplace through an independent contractor agency sales force and brokers.\nThe Closed Block segment consists of group and individual long-term care, individual disability, and other insurance products no longer actively marketed. We discontinued offering individual long-term care in 2009 and group long-term care in 2012. Individual disability in this segment generally consists of policies we sold prior to the mid-1990s and entirely discontinued selling in 2004. Other insurance products include group pension, individual life and corporate-owned life insurance, reinsurance pools and management operations, and other miscellaneous product lines.\nThe Corporate segment includes investment income on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, interest expense on corporate debt other than non-recourse debt, and certain other corporate income and expenses not allocated to a line of business.\nCosts Related to Organizational Design Update\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, we realigned certain parts of our organizational structure by shifting resources to accelerate growth, fund priority investments, and simplify and improve our business practices. In connection with this update, we incurred charges of $23.3 million, which primarily consisted of employee severance and benefit costs as well as certain costs related to lease terminations and the disposal of certain fixed assets. These costs were recorded within either compensation expense or other expenses in the consolidated statements of income and were included within our Corporate segment. This update did not result in the exit or disposal of any of our lines of business and we do not expect material additional costs associated with this update in the future.\nAcquisitions of Business\nOn November 1, 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the shares and voting interests in Jaimini Health, Inc. (Jaimini Health), a dental health maintenance organization. The acquisition of Jaimini Health will broaden our employee benefit dental offerings in the U.S., particularly in the state of California, and is reported in our Unum US segment.\nOn October 1, 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the shares and voting interests in Unum Poland, a financial protection benefits provider in Poland. This acquisition will expand our European presence, which we believe to be an attractive market for financial protection benefits.\nOn January 1, 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the shares and voting interests in Leavelogic, Inc (Leavelogic), a leave management technology provider. The acquisition of Leavelogic will enhance our current leave management offerings by providing tools for employers and employees to better manage the family leave process and is reported in our Unum US segment.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 13 - Segment Information - Continued\nAggregate revenues for all three acquired entities totaled approximately $61 million in 2017. Aggregate assets were valued at approximately $344 million as of the respective acquisition dates and were primarily comprised of bonds, short-term investments, and intangible assets attributable to the value of business acquired, the value of distribution networks, and licenses. Aggregate liabilities were valued at approximately $206 million as of the respective acquisition dates and were primarily comprised of outstanding claim liabilities, reserves for future claims, and income tax liabilities. The aggregate purchase price for all three transactions was approximately $151 million and exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets by approximately $13 million, which was identified as goodwill, primarily attributable to the value of adding individual and group financial protection products in Poland to our current employee benefit offerings and the value of enhancing our technology capabilities around our leave management offerings. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes except upon disposition of the acquired entities. These acquisitions, the results of which are included in our consolidated financial statements for the periods subsequent to the respective dates of acquisition, did not have a material impact on revenue or results of operations for 2018.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 13 - Segment Information - Continued\nSegment information is as follows:\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 13 - Segment Information - Continued\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 13 - Segment Information - Continued\nRevenue is primarily derived from sources in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland. There are no material revenues or assets attributable to foreign operations other than those reported in our Unum International segment.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 13 - Segment Information - Continued\nWe report goodwill in our Unum US, Unum International, and Colonial Life segments, which are the segments expected to benefit from the originating business combinations. At December 31, 2020 and 2019 goodwill was $353.0 million and $351.7 million, respectively, with $280.0 million attributable to Unum US in each year, $45.3 million and $44.0 million, respectively, attributable to Unum International, and $27.7 million attributable to Colonial Life in each year.\nStockholders' equity is allocated to the operating segments on the basis of an internal allocation formula that reflects the volume and risk components of each operating segment's business and aligns allocated equity with our target capital levels for regulatory and rating agency purposes. We modify this formula periodically to recognize changes in the views of capital requirements.\nWe measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of \"adjusted operating revenue\" and \"adjusted operating income\" or \"adjusted operating loss\", which differ from total revenue and income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and amortization of the cost of reinsurance as well as certain other items specified in the reconciliations below. We believe adjusted operating revenue and adjusted operating income or loss are better performance measures and better indicators of the revenue and profitability and underlying trends in our business. These performance measures are in accordance with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for total revenue, income before income tax, or net income.\nRealized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments. Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses. Although we may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities.\nAs previously discussed in Note 12, we have exited a substantial portion of our closed block individual disability product line through the reinsurance agreement that was executed in December 2020. As a result, we exclude the amortization of the cost of reinsurance that was recognized as a result of the exit of the business related to the DLR cohort of policies. We believe that the exclusion of the amortization of the cost of reinsurance provides a better view of our results from our ongoing businesses.\nWe may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability.\nSee above and Notes 6, 8, 12, and 15 for further discussion regarding the impacts of the 2018 and 2020 long-term care reserve increases, the group pension reserve increase, the impacts from of the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction, the amortization of the cost of reinsurance, the net tax benefit from the reinsurance transaction, costs related to the organizational design update, the impairment loss on the ROU asset related to one of our operating leases for office space, and the cost related to the early retirement of debt.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 13 - Segment Information - Continued\nA reconciliation of total revenue to \"adjusted operating revenue\" and income before income tax to \"adjusted operating income\" is as follows:\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 14 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\nContingent Liabilities\nWe are a defendant in a number of litigation matters that have arisen in the normal course of business, including the matters discussed below. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning our compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations. Given the complexity and scope of our litigation and regulatory matters, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations or legal proceedings or provide reasonable estimates of potential losses, except if noted in connection with specific matters.\nIn some of these matters, no specified amount is sought. In others, very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are asserted. There is a wide variation of pleading practice permitted in the United States courts with respect to requests for monetary damages, including some courts in which no specified amount is required and others which allow the plaintiff to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of that court. Further, some jurisdictions permit plaintiffs to allege damages well in excess of reasonably possible verdicts. Based on our extensive experience and that of others in the industry with respect to litigating or resolving claims through settlement over an extended period of time, we believe that the monetary damages asserted in a lawsuit or claim bear little relation to the merits of the case, or the likely disposition value. Therefore, the specific monetary relief sought is not stated.\nUnless indicated otherwise in the descriptions below, reserves have not been established for litigation and contingencies. An estimated loss is accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nClaims Handling Matters\nWe and our insurance subsidiaries, in the ordinary course of our business, are engaged in claim litigation where disputes arise as a result of a denial or termination of benefits. Most typically these lawsuits are filed on behalf of a single claimant or policyholder, and in some of these individual actions punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims. For our general claim litigation, we maintain reserves based on experience to satisfy judgments and settlements in the normal course. We expect that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to general claim litigation, after consideration of the reserves maintained, will not be material to our consolidated financial condition. Nevertheless, given the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain claim litigation involving punitive damages could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in a period, depending on the results of operations for the particular period.\nFrom time to time class action allegations are pursued where the claimant or policyholder purports to represent a larger number of individuals who are similarly situated. Since each insurance claim is evaluated based on its own merits, there is rarely a single act or series of actions which can properly be addressed by a class action. Nevertheless, we monitor these cases closely and defend ourselves appropriately where these allegations are made.\nMiscellaneous Matters\nSimilar to other insurers, we were the subject of an examination by a third party acting on behalf of a number of state treasurers concerning our compliance with the unclaimed property laws of the participating states. We cooperated fully with this examination and in the fourth quarter of 2017, we started the process to reach a Global Resolution Agreement with the third party regarding settlement of the examination, which we finalized in January of 2018. Under the terms of the agreement, the third party acting on behalf of the signatory states compared insured data to the Social Security Administration's Death Master File to identify deceased insureds and contract holders where a valid claim has not been made. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we established reserves which reflect our estimate of the liability expected to be paid as we execute on the terms of the settlement. We also are cooperating with a Delaware Market Conduct examination involving the same issue, which is currently inactive. The legal and regulatory environment around unclaimed death benefits continues to evolve. It is possible that the current settlement and/or similar investigations by other state jurisdictions may result in payments to beneficiaries, the payment of abandoned funds under state law, and/or administrative penalties, the total of which may be in excess of the reserves established.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 14 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities - Continued\nSecurities Class Actions: Three alleged securities class action lawsuits have been filed against Unum Group and individual defendants as follows:\n\u2022On June 13, 2018, an alleged securities class action lawsuit entitled Cynthia Pittman v. Unum Group, Richard McKenney, John McGarry, and Daniel Waxenberg was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. The plaintiff seeks to represent purchasers of Unum Group publicly traded securities between January 31, 2018 and May 2, 2018. The plaintiff alleges the Company caused its shares to trade at artificially high levels by failing to disclose information about the rate of long-term care policy terminations and long-term care claim incidence resulting in misleading statements about capital management plans and long-term care reserves. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial. The Company strongly denies these allegations and will vigorously defend the litigation.\n\u2022On July 13, 2018, an alleged securities class action lawsuit entitled Scott Cunningham v. Unum Group, Richard McKenney, John McGarry, and Daniel Waxenberg was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. The allegations, class period, and damages claimed mirror those in the Pittman matter. The Company strongly denies these allegations and will vigorously defend the litigation.\n\u2022On July 25, 2018, an alleged securities class action lawsuit entitled City of Taylor Police and Fire Retirement System v. Unum Group, Richard McKenney, John McGarry, Steve Zabel, and Daniel Waxenberg was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. The plaintiff seeks to represent purchasers of Unum Group publicly traded securities between October 27, 2016 and May 1, 2018. The allegations and damages claimed mirror those in the Pittman matter. The Company strongly denies these allegations and will vigorously defend the litigation.\nOn November 9, 2018, the court consolidated the Pittman, Cunningham, and City of Taylor Police and Fire Retirement System cases into one matter entitled In re Unum Group Securities Litigation, appointed a lead plaintiff and lead plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and directed the plaintiff to file a consolidated amended complaint. On January 15, 2019, the plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint asserting claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial as well as costs, expenses, and attorney\u2019s fees. On March 18, 2019, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. On November 4, 2019 the court heard oral argument on the motion. On June 1, 2020, the court granted the Company's motion and dismissed the cases with prejudice. On June 26, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court has scheduled oral argument for March 2, 2021.\nWe believe the appeal and the underlying claims lack merit and reserves have not been established for these matters as we are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses. However, an adverse outcome in one or more of these actions could, depending on the nature, scope, and amount of any ruling, materially adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in a period.\nNote 15 - Leases\nWe lease certain buildings and equipment under various noncancellable operating lease agreements. In addition, we have sub-lease agreements on a limited number of our building lease agreements. The majority of our building leases and sub-leases expire within a five to ten year period and we generally have the option to renew at the end of the lease term at the fair rental value at the time of renewal. The majority of our equipment leases expire within a one to three year period and we generally have the option to renew at the end of the lease term at the fair rental value at the time of renewal.\nWe do not have any lease agreements or sub-lease agreements that contain variable lease payments. In addition, we do not have lease agreements or sub-lease agreements that contain residual value guarantees or impose any financial restrictions or covenants with the lessors.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 15 - Leases - Continued\nOperating lease information is as follows:\nOperating lease cost as calculated prior to the adoption of ASC 842 was $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2020, aggregate undiscounted minimum net lease payments and the reconciliation to our lease liability are as follows (in millions of dollars):\nThe right-of-use asset was $82.9 million and $108.6 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDuring 2020, we recognized an impairment loss of $12.7 million on the ROU asset related to one of our operating leases for office space that we do not plan to continue using to support our general operations. The impairment loss was recorded as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the ROU asset compared to its carrying value. The fair value of the ROU asset was determined based on a discounted cash flow model utilizing estimated market rates for sub-lease rentals. The impairment loss is recorded within other expenses in the consolidated statements of income and is included within our Corporate segment.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 16 - Statutory Financial Information\nStatutory Net Income, Capital and Surplus, and Dividends\nStatutory net income for U.S. life insurance companies is reported in conformity with statutory accounting principles prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and adopted by applicable domiciliary state laws. The commissioners of the states of domicile have the right to permit other specific practices that may deviate from prescribed practices. In connection with a financial examination of Unum America, which closed at the end of the second quarter of 2020, the Maine Bureau of Insurance (MBOI) concluded that Unum America\u2019s long-term care statutory reserves are deficient by $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2018, the financial statement date of the examination period. The MBOI granted permission to Unum America on May 1, 2020, to phase in the additional statutory reserves over seven years beginning with year-end 2020 and ending with year-end 2026. This strengthening will be incorporated using explicitly agreed upon margins into our existing assumptions for annual statutory reserve adequacy testing. These actions will add margin to Unum America's best estimate assumptions. Our long-term care reserves and financial results reported under generally accepted accounting principles are not affected by the MBOI\u2019s examination conclusion. We plan to fund the additional statutory reserves with expected cash flows. If the permitted practice was not granted by the MBOI to phase in these additional statutory reserves, the impact to the risk-based capital ratio would have triggered a regulatory event. The 2020 phase-in amount was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 and was approximately $229 million. Our other traditional U.S. life insurance subsidiaries have no prescribed or permitted statutory accounting practices that differ materially from statutory accounting principles prescribed by the NAIC.\nUnum America cedes certain blocks of business to Fairwind Insurance Company (Fairwind), which is an affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiary (captive reinsurer) domiciled in the United States, with Unum Group as the ultimate parent. This captive reinsurer was established for the limited purpose of reinsuring risks attributable to specified policies issued or reinsured by Unum America.\nFairwind, which is domiciled in the state of Vermont, is required to follow GAAP in accordance with Vermont reporting requirements for pure captive insurance companies, unless the commissioner permits the use of some other basis of accounting. Fairwind has permission from Vermont to follow accounting practices that are generally consistent with current NAIC statutory accounting principles for its insurance reserves and invested assets supporting reserves. All other assets and liabilities are accounted for in accordance with GAAP, as prescribed by Vermont, which includes the full recognition of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized. Statutory accounting principles have a stricter limitation for the recognition of deferred tax assets. The impact of following the prescribed and permitted practices of Vermont rather than statutory accounting principles prescribed by the NAIC resulted in higher capital and surplus for Fairwind of approximately $287 million and $194 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively. Included in the 2020 results for Fairwind was the $229 million increase to long-term care statutory reserves assumed from Unum America. Included in the 2018 results for Fairwind was the assumed portion of the statutory impact of the 2018 long-term care reserve increase.\nIn December 2020, prior to entering into the reinsurance transaction with Commonwealth, Provident, Paul Revere Life, and Unum America recaptured their respective reinsurance agreements with Northwind Reinsurance Company, a wholly-owned domestic special purpose reinsurance subsidiary (Northwind Re). Northwind Re was established for the limited purpose of reinsuring risks attributable to specified policies issued or reinsured by the aforementioned companies, and has no material state prescribed accounting practices that differ from statutory accounting principles prescribed by the NAIC. See Note 12 for further discussion regarding the reinsurance transaction with Commonwealth.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 16 - Statutory Financial Information - Continued\nThe operating results and capital and surplus of our traditional U.S. life insurance subsidiaries and our captive reinsurers, prepared in accordance with prescribed or permitted accounting practices of the NAIC or states of domicile, are presented separately below.\nSolvency II, a European Union directive prescribes capital requirements and risk management standards for the European insurance industry. As derived from the most recent annual financial statements for December 31, 2019, based on Solvency II requirements, regulatory net income and own funds available of our United Kingdom insurance subsidiary, Unum Limited, were \u00a391.0 million and \u00a3656.1 million, respectively.\nRisk-based capital (RBC) standards for U.S. life insurance companies are prescribed by the NAIC. The domiciliary states of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries have all adopted a version of the RBC model formula of the NAIC, which prescribes a system for assessing the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus for all life and health insurers. The basis of the system is a risk-based formula that applies prescribed factors to the various risk elements in a life and health insurer's business to report a minimum capital requirement proportional to the amount of risk assumed by the insurer. The life and health RBC formula is designed to measure annually (i) the risk of loss from asset defaults and asset value fluctuations, (ii) the risk of loss from adverse mortality and morbidity experience, (iii) the risk of loss from mismatching of asset and liability cash flow due to changing interest rates, and (iv) business risks. The formula is used as an early warning tool to identify companies that are potentially inadequately capitalized. State insurance laws grant insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. The total adjusted capital of each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2020 is in excess of those RBC levels.\nRestrictions under applicable state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries in any 12-month period without prior approval by regulatory authorities. For life insurance companies domiciled in the U.S., that limitation generally equals, depending on the state of domicile, either ten percent of an insurer's statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the statutory net gain from operations, excluding realized investment gains and losses, of the preceding year. The payment of dividends to a parent company from a life insurance subsidiary is generally further limited to the amount of unassigned funds.\nBased on the restrictions under current law, approximately $974 million is available, without prior approval by regulatory authorities, during 2021 for the payment of dividends to Unum Group from its traditional U.S. life insurance subsidiaries. The ability of our captive insurers to pay dividends to their respective parent companies will depend on their satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and on the performance of the business reinsured.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 16 - Statutory Financial Information - Continued\nWe also have the ability to receive dividends from our foreign subsidiaries, primarily in the U.K., for which the payment may be subject to applicable insurance company regulations and capital guidance. Approximately \u00a3170.0 million is considered distributable from Unum Limited during 2021, subject to local solvency standards and regulatory approval.\nDeposits\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries had on deposit with U.S. regulatory authorities securities with a book value of $135.5 million and $135.2 million, respectively, held for the protection of policyholders.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\nUnum Group and Subsidiaries\nNote 17 - Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited)\nThe following is a summary of our unaudited quarterly results of operations for 2020 and 2019:\nItems affecting the comparability of our financial results are as follows:\n\u2022Fourth quarter of 2020 net realized investment gain of $1,302.3 million before tax and $1,028.8 million after tax, related to the transfer of investments for the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction.\n\u2022Fourth quarter of 2020 impacts from the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction of $1,305.5 million before tax and $1,031.3 million after tax.\n\u2022Fourth quarter of 2020 amortization of the cost of reinsurance related to the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction of $2.6 million before tax and $2.0 million after tax.\n\u2022Fourth quarter of 2020 net tax benefit from the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction of $36.5 million.\n\u2022Fourth quarter of 2020 reserve increases of $151.5 million and $17.5 million before tax and $119.7 million and $13.8 million after tax related to long-term care and group pension, respectively.\n\u2022Third quarter of 2020 costs related to organizational design update of $23.3 million before tax and $18.6 million after tax.\n\u2022Second quarter of 2020 impairment on ROU asset related to an operating lease for office space that we do not plan to continue using to support our general operations of $12.7 million before tax and $10.0 million after tax.\n\u2022Fourth quarter of 2019 cost related to the early retirement of debt of $2.1 million before tax and $1.7 million after tax.\n\u2022Third quarter of 2019 cost related to the early retirement of debt of $25.2 million before tax and $19.9 million after tax.\nSee Notes 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, and 15 for further discussion of the above items.",

    "item_9A": "ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this report. We evaluated those controls based on the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework from the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, these officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020.\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company's internal control over financial reporting encompasses the processes and procedures management has established to (i) maintain records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the Company's transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; (iii) provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are appropriately authorized; and (iv) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, any projection of the evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nWe assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.\nAttestation Report of the Company's Registered Public Accounting Firm\nErnst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements included herein, audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2020, and issued the attestation report included as follows.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Unum Group\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Unum Group and subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Unum Group and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated February 17, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying \u201cManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\u201d. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nChattanooga, Tennessee\nFebruary 17, 2021",

Under the plan, directors made an irrevocable election each year to receive all or a portion of their retainers and meeting fees in either cash or deferred share rights. A deferred share right is a right to receive one share of common stock on the earlier of (i) the director\u2019s separation from service as a director of the company, or (ii) another designated date at least three years after the date of the deferral election. The number of deferred share rights granted is calculated as the number of whole shares equal to (i) the dollar amount of the annual retainer and/or fees that the director elects to have paid in deferred share rights, divided by (ii) the fair market value per share on the grant date. The aggregate number of shares which can be issued under the plan is 500,000. This plan terminated in May 2010 with respect to new awards, though dividend equivalents remain available for future issuance in respect of awards that were outstanding at that time. The plan is administered by the Human Capital Committee. The plan includes provisions restricting the transferability of the deferred share rights, provisions for adjustments to the number of shares available for grants, and the number of shares subject to outstanding grants in the event of recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, or other similar corporate transaction.",

Under this agreement, we received a fixed rate of interest and paid a variable rate of interest, based off of three-month LIBOR. During 2020, the $250.0 million notional amount of the interest rate swap matured in conjunction with the maturity of the hedged debt.\nJunior Subordinated Debt Securities\nIn May 2018, we issued $300.0 million of 6.250% junior subordinated notes due 2058.

These capital securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Unum Group, have a liquidation value of $1,000 per capital security, and have a mandatory redemption feature under certain circumstances. In connection with the capital securities offering, Unum Group issued to the Trust 7.405% junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures due 2038. The Trust is a variable interest entity of which Unum Group is not the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the capital securities issued by the Trust are not included in the consolidated financial statements of Unum Group and subsidiaries and our liability represents the junior subordinated debt securities owed to the trust which is recorded in long-term debt.

The retirement of any liquidation amount regarding the capital securities by the Trust results in a corresponding retirement of principal amount of the junior subordinated debt securities.\nDuring 2019, the Trust purchased and retired $22.8 million aggregate liquidation amount of the 7.405% capital securities due 2038, which resulted in our purchase and retirement of a corresponding principal amount of our 7.405% junior subordinated debt securities due 2038.\nCost Related to Early Retirement of Debt\nDuring 2019, we incurred costs of $27.3 million related to the early retirement of certain of our unsecured notes and junior subordinated debt securities as previously discussed.\nInterest Paid\nInterest paid on long-term and short-term debt and related securities during 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $176.6 million, $168.4 million, and $161.4 million, respectively.\nCredit Facilities\nWe have access to two separate unsecured revolving credit facilities, each with a different syndicate of lenders.

The two primary financial covenants include limitations based on our leverage ratio and consolidated net worth. We are also subject to covenants that limit subsidiary indebtedness.
