    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nGeneral\nBK Technologies Corporation (NYSE American: BKTI) (together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, \u201cBK,\u201d the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a holding company that, through BK Technologies, Inc., its operating subsidiary, provides two-way radio communications equipment of high quality and reliability. All operating activities described herein are undertaken by our operating subsidiary.\nIn business for over 70 years, BK designs, manufactures and markets American made wireless communications products consisting of two-way land mobile radios (\u201cLMRs\u201d), repeaters, base stations and related components and subsystems. Two-way LMRs can be units that are hand-held (portable) or installed in vehicles (mobile). Repeaters expand the range of two-way LMRs, enabling them to operate over a wider area. Base station components and subsystems are installed at radio transmitter sites to improve performance by enhancing the signal and reducing or eliminating signal interference and enabling the use of one antenna for both transmission and reception. We employ both analog and digital technologies in our products.\nOur digital technology is compliant with the Project 25 standard (\u201cP-25\u201d) for digital LMR equipment. The P-25 has been adopted by representatives from the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International (\u201cAPCO\u201d), the National Association of State Technology Directors (\u201cNASTD\u201d), the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) Federal Government and other public safety user organizations. Our P-25 digital products and our analog products function in the very high frequency (\u201cVHF\u201d) (136MHz - 174MHz), ultra-high frequency (\u201cUHF\u201d) (380MHz - 470MHz, 450MHz - 520MHz), and 700-800 MHz bands. Our P-25 KNG and KNG2 Series mobile and portable digital radios have been validated under the P-25 Compliance Assessment Program (\u201cCAP\u201d) as being P-25 compliant and interoperable with the communications network infrastructure of six of our competitors. Since we do not provide our own communications network infrastructure, we believe CAP validation provides confidence for federal, state and local emergency response agencies that our products are a viable and attractive alternative for use on the infrastructure of our competitors.\nWe offer products under the brand names BK Radio and RELM. Generally, BK Technologies and BK Radio-branded products serve the government and public safety market and comprise the largest segment of our business, while RELM-branded products serve the commercial and industrial market.\nBK Technologies, BKR and BK Radio-branded products consist of high-specification LMR equipment for professional radio users primarily in government, public safety and military applications. These products have more extensive features and capabilities than those offered in the RELM line. Our P-25 digital products are marketed under the BK Radio brand, which includes the BKR, KNG and KNG2 product lines. RELM-branded products provide basic yet feature-rich and reliable two-way communications for commercial and industrial concerns, such as hotels, construction firms, schools and transportation services. Typically, these users are not radio professionals and require easy, fast and affordable communication among a defined group of users.\nWe believe that we provide superior value to a wide array of customers with demanding requirements, including, for example, emergency response, public safety, homeland security and military customers of federal, state and municipal government agencies, as well as various commercial enterprises. Our two-way radio products excel in applications with harsh and hazardous conditions. They provide high-specification performance, durability and reliability at a lower cost relative to comparable offerings.\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 24, 1997. We are the resulting corporation from the reincorporation merger of our predecessor, Adage, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, which reincorporated from Pennsylvania to Nevada effective as of January 30, 1998. Effective on June 4, 2018, we changed our corporate name from \u201cRELM Wireless Corporation\u201d to \u201cBK Technologies, Inc.\u201d\nOn March 28, 2019, we implemented a holding company reorganization. The reorganization created a new holding company, BK Technologies Corporation, which became the new parent company of BK Technologies, Inc. BK Technologies Corporation\u2019s only significant assets are the outstanding equity interests in BK Technologies, Inc. and any other future subsidiaries of BK Technologies Corporation. The holding company reorganization was intended to create a more efficient corporate structure and increase operational flexibility.\nFor the purpose of this report, references to \u201cwe\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d or our management or business at any period prior to the holding company reorganization (March 28, 2019) refer to those of BK Technologies, Inc. as the predecessor company and its subsidiaries and thereafter to those of BK Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries, except as otherwise specified or to the extent the context otherwise indicates.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 7100 Technology Drive, West Melbourne, Florida 32904 and our telephone number is (321) 984-1414.\nAvailable Information\nOur Internet website address is www.bktechnologies.com. We make available on our Internet website, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to these reports as soon as practicable after we file such material with, or furnish it to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). In addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Code of Ethics for the CEO and Senior Financial Officers, Audit Committee Charter, Compensation Committee Charter, Nominating and Governance Committee Charter and other corporate governance policies are available on our website, under \u201cInvestor Relations.\u201d The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference in this report.

All reports that the Company files with or furnishes to the SEC also are available free of charge via the SEC\u2019s website at http://www.sec.gov.\nSignificant Events\nDuring 2020, pursuant to our capital return program, we declared and paid four quarterly dividends of $0.02 per share of our common stock. We have paid nineteen consecutive quarterly dividends.\nIn October 2020, we announced that our operating subsidiary received an order totaling approximately $1.5 million dollars from a public safety agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior (DoI). The order was for BK\u2019s Digital P-25 KNG2-Series portable radios and KNG Series mobile radios, with related accessories, and was fulfilled during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIn October 2020, we announced that our operating subsidiary received an order totaling approximately $1.1 million from an agency of the state of Tennessee. The order was for BK\u2019s newly introduced BKR 5000 Digital P-25 portable radio with related accessories and was fulfilled during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIn August 2020, we announced the market introduction of the BKR 5000 portable radio; the first model in the new BKR Series of APCO Project 25 land mobile radio products and solutions, which will also include multi-band capability.\nIn August 2020, we announced the engagement of a national investor relations firm to launch a comprehensive investor relations program.\nIn August 2020, we announced that our operating subsidiary received an order totaling approximately $1.1 million from the National Interagency Fire Center (\u201cNIFC\u201d). The order was for BK\u2019s KNG2-Series Digital P-25 portable radios with related accessories. This order was fulfilled during the third quarter of 2020.\nIn August 2020, we announced that our operating subsidiary was awarded a contract for up to $4.2 million dollars from an electric utility agency of the U.S. Department of Energy (\u201cDoE\u201d). The contract was for BK\u2019s KNG2 and KNG Digital P-25 portable and mobile radios with related accessories for deployment at more than 35 sites in the United States. The contract covers a period of one year, which commenced on June 24, 2020 and will expire on June 23, 2021, providing for purchases of equipment up to $4.2 million. It did not specify precise delivery dates or quantities. Shortly after awarding the contract, the DoE issued firm purchase orders for equipment totaling approximately $3.1 million, which were fulfilled in the third quarter of 2020.\nIn May 2020, we announced that our operating subsidiary received orders totaling approximately $1.4 million from the U.S. Forest Service (\u201cUSFS\u201d). The orders were for KNG-Series Digital P-25 portable radios, mobile radios and base stations with related accessories, and were fulfilled during the second quarter of 2020.\nIn May 2020, we implemented workforce reductions of approximately 18% to reduce costs and to better position us in an uncertain business environment due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. We incurred approximately $0.2 million in severance costs relating to these workforce reductions, which were recognized in the second quarter of 2020 and paid in accordance with our normal payroll practices through September 2020.\nIn April 2020, we received approval and funding pursuant to a promissory note evidencing an unsecured loan in the amount of approximately $2.2 million (the \u201cLoan\u201d) under the Paycheck Protection Program (or \u201cPPP\u201d). The PPP was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d). We intended to use the Loan for qualifying expenses in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act. At the time of application we believed that we qualified to receive the funds pursuant to the PPP. Subsequently, the SBA, in consultation with the Department of Treasury, issued new guidance that created uncertainty regarding the qualification requirements for a PPP loan. In April 2020, out of an abundance of caution, we repaid the loan in full.\nIn February 2020, we announced that our operating subsidiary received orders totaling approximately $2.8 million from the USFS. The orders were for KNG-Series Digital P-25 portable radios, mobile radios, and base stations, as well as related accessories, and were fulfilled in the first quarter of 2020.\nIn March 2020, we announced that our operating subsidiary received an order totaling approximately $2.1 million from the USFS. The order was for KNG-Series Digital P-25 mobile radios and related accessories. The order was fulfilled during the first and second quarters of 2020.\nIn March 2020, Fundamental Global Investors, LLC (\u201cFG\u201d), on behalf of the funds managed by it, entered into a stock trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201c10b5-1 Plan\u201d), for the purchase of up to one million shares of our common stock. The 10b5-1 Plan became effective on April 2, 2020 and will terminate on April 2, 2021 or such earlier date as set forth in the 10b5-1 Plan. Transactions under the 10b5-1 Plan, if any, will be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. D. Kyle Cerminara, the Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder and Partner of FG, is a member of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. FG, with its affiliates, is our largest stockholder.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) surfaced in Wuhan, China, which spread globally and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy increased significantly as the year 2020 progressed, and we anticipate the effects of COVID-19 may continue to have an adverse impact on our operations going forward. In response to COVID-19, national and local governments around the world have instituted certain measures, including travel bans, prohibitions on group events and gatherings, shutdowns of certain businesses, curfews, shelter-in-place orders and recommendations to practice social distancing. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have undertaken certain measures in an effort to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including implementing employee safety measures and taking steps to reduce expenses, including workforce reductions. The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and the related length of its impact on the global economy, all of which are uncertain and, given the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global responses to curb its spread, cannot be predicted at this time. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of the pandemic\u2019s national and, to some extent, global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nIndustry Overview\nLMR communications consist of hand-held (portable) and vehicle-mounted (mobile) two-way radios commonly used by the public safety sector (e.g., police, fire, and emergency responders), military and commercial business concerns (e.g., corporate disaster recovery, hotels, airports, farms, transportation service providers, and construction firms), and government agencies within the U.S. and abroad. LMR systems are constructed to meet an organization\u2019s specific communications needs. The cost of a complete system can vary widely, depending on the size and configuration. Likewise, the cost of radio sets can range from under $100 for a basic analog portable, to thousands of dollars for a fully featured P-25 digital unit. Typically, there are no recurring airtime usage charges. Accordingly, LMR usage patterns are considerably different from those for cellular and other wireless communications tools. LMR usage often consists of direct radio-to-radio communications outside of the range of a communication network with one-to-many members of a group. Also, LMR functions with push-to-talk operation (i.e., no call set-up or dialing a phone number is required). LMR communications often consist of multiple short (five second) transmissions between multiple members of a group. For the public safety sector, this is known as Mission Critical Voice. The average useful life of a unit can vary, depending upon the application in which the unit is deployed and its handling.\nLMR systems are the most widely-used and longest-used form of wireless dispatch communications in the U.S., having been first placed in service in 1921. LMR was initially used almost exclusively by law enforcement, and all radio communications were transmitted in an analog format. Analog transmissions typically consist of a voice or other signal modulated directly onto a continuous radio carrier wave. Over time, advances in technology decreased the cost of LMR products and increased their popularity and usage by businesses and other agencies. Responding to the growing usage, additional radio frequency spectrum was allocated by the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) for LMR use.\nMore recently, growth of the LMR industry has slowed, reflecting several factors:\n\u25cf\nLMR is a mature industry, having been in existence for over 90 years;\n\u25cf\nsome LMR users are in mature industry segments that have experienced slow growth rates;\n\u25cf\nfunding and budgets for government and public safety agencies have been constrained; and\n\u25cf\nlimited availability of radio frequency spectrum, which hinders existing users in expanding their systems and potential new users from establishing new systems.\nYears ago, as a result of the limited spectrum availability, the FCC mandated that new LMR equipment utilize technology that is more spectrum-efficient. This effectively meant that the industry had to migrate to digital technology. Responding to the mandate, the APCO, the NASTD, the U.S. Federal Government and the Telecommunications Industry Association (\u201cTIA\u201d), in concert with several LMR manufacturers, including BK, recommended a standard for digital LMR devices that would meet the FCC spectrum-efficiency requirements and provide solutions to several problems experienced primarily by public safety users. The standard is called P-25. The primary objectives of P-25 are to: (i) allow effective and reliable communication among users of compliant equipment, regardless of its manufacturer, known as interoperability, (ii) maximize radio spectrum efficiency and (iii) promote competition among LMR providers through an open system architecture.\nAlthough the FCC does not require public safety agencies or any radio users to purchase P-25 equipment or otherwise adopt the standard, compliance with the standard is a primary consideration for government and public safety purchasers. In addition, U.S. Federal Government grant programs that provide assistance in funding for state and local agencies to purchase interoperable communications equipment for first responders strongly encourage compliance with the P-25 standard. Accordingly, although funding for LMR purchases by many government agencies is limited, we believe that, as users upgrade equipment to achieve interoperability and comply with FCC narrow-banding mandates, demand for P-25 equipment will continue to grow. Additionally, the P-25 standard has also been widely adopted in other countries. The migration to P-25 equipment is primarily limited to government and public safety agencies. Radio users in the business and industrial market utilize alternative digital technologies (e.g., Digital Mobile Radio) and analog LMR products.\nPresently, the market is dominated by one supplier, Motorola Solutions, Inc., which offers a broader range of products than we do, including multiband radios. However, the open architecture of the P-25 standard is designed to eliminate the ability of one or more suppliers to lock out competitors. Formerly, because of proprietary characteristics incorporated in many LMR systems, a customer was effectively precluded from purchasing additional LMR products from a supplier other than the initial supplier of the system. Additionally, the system infrastructure technology was prohibitive for smaller suppliers to develop and implement. P-25 provides an environment in which users will increasingly have a wider selection of LMR suppliers, including smaller suppliers such as BK.\nDescription of Products and P-25 CAP Compliance\nWe design, manufacture, and market wireless communications equipment consisting of two-way LMRs, repeaters, base stations and related components and subsystems. We do not provide complete, integrated, communications systems and infrastructure. Two-way LMRs can be units that are hand-held (portable) or installed in vehicles (mobile). Repeaters expand the range of two-way LMRs, enabling them to communicate over a wider area. Base station components and subsystems are installed at radio transmitter sites to improve performance by enhancing the signal, reducing or eliminating signal interference and enabling the use of one antenna for both transmission and reception.\nWe employ both analog and digital technologies in our products. Our digital products are compliant with P-25 specifications. Our P-25 digital products and our analog products function in the VHF (136MHz - 174MHz), UHF (380MHz - 470MHz, 450MHz - 520MHz), and 700-800 MHz bands.\nOur P-25 KNG, KNG2 and BKR Series mobile and portable digital radios have been validated under the P-25 CAP as being P-25 compliant and interoperable with the communications network infrastructure of six of our competitors. Since we do not provide our own communications network infrastructure, we believe CAP validation provides confidence for federal, state and local emergency response agencies that our products are a viable and attractive alternative for use on the infrastructure of our competitors.\nThe P-25 CAP is a voluntary program that allows LMR equipment suppliers to formally demonstrate their products\u2019 compliance with P-25 requirements. The purpose of the program is to provide federal, state and local emergency response agencies with evidence that the communications equipment they are purchasing satisfies the P-25 standard for performance, conformance and interoperability. The program is a result of legislation passed by the U.S. Congress to improve communication interoperability for first responders and is a partnership of the U.S Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d)\u2019s Command, Control and Interoperability Division, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, radio equipment manufacturers and the emergency response community.\nDescription of Markets\nGovernment and Public Safety Market\nThe government and public safety market includes military, fire, rescue, law enforcement, homeland security and emergency responder personnel. In most instances, BK Radio-branded products serve this market and are sold either directly to end-users or through two-way communications dealers. Government and public safety sales represented approximately 92% of our total sales for 2020 and 93% for 2019.\nGovernment and public safety users currently use products that employ either P-25 digital or analog technology. However, public safety users in federal, state and local government agencies and certain other countries are migrating to primarily using digital P-25 products. The evolution of the standard and compliant digital products is explained in the \u201cIndustry Overview\u201d section above.\nBusiness and Industrial Market\nThis market includes enterprises of all sizes that require fast and affordable push-to-talk communication among a discrete group of users, such as corporate disaster recovery, hotels, construction firms, schools and transportation service providers. Users in this market continue to predominantly utilize analog products. We offer products to this market under the RELM brand name. Our sales in this market may be direct to end-users or to dealers and distributors who then resell the products. Our sales to this market represented approximately 8% of our total sales for 2020 and 7% for 2019.\nEngineering, Research and Development\nOur engineering and product development activities are conducted by a team of 23 employees. Their primary development focus has been the design of a new line of next-generation P-25 digital products, the BKR Series, which will include multi-band technology and eventually supplant our flagship KNG and KNG2 products. The first product in this line was introduced in August 2020, with additional models planned for 2021 and beyond. The first models in the KNG line were introduced in 2008 and are included on our primary federal contract vehicles. Subsequently, we added UHF and 700-800MHz products, as well as P-25 Phase II TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) trunking. The KNG2 Series was introduced in 2016. Our KNG, KNG2 and BKR products also provide encrypted operation for secured communication, GPS location and network authentication capabilities.\nA segment of our engineering team is responsible for product specifications based on customer requirements and participates in quality assurance activities. They also have primary responsibility for applied and production engineering.\nFor 2020 and 2019, our engineering and development expenses were approximately $7.9 million and $9.8 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily attributed to the elimination or reduction of outside engineering resources, and the completion of portions of our new product development initiatives.\nIntellectual Property\nWe presently have no U.S. patents in force. We have registered federal trademarks related to the names \u201cBK Technologies,\u201d \u201cBK Radio\u201d and \u201cRadios for Heroes\u201d and have applied for registration of \u201cBKR.\u201d We rely on trade secret laws and employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights.\nManufacturing and Raw Materials\nOur manufacturing strategy is to utilize the highest quality and most cost-effective resources available for every aspect of our manufacturing. Consistent with that strategy, we have successfully utilized a hybrid of U.S.-based internal manufacturing capability in concert with outside contract arrangements for different manufacturing processes. The breadth of our internal manufacturing capabilities has been expanded during 2019 and 2020. Our outside manufacturing contract arrangements have been managed and updated to meet our present requirements, including increasing relationships with American concerns. This hybrid approach has been instrumental in controlling our product costs, allowing us to be competitive and manage our gross margins.\nContract manufacturers produce various subassemblies and products on our behalf. Generally, the contract manufacturers procure raw materials from BK-approved sources and complete manufacturing activities in accordance with our specifications. Manufacturing agreements and purchase orders govern the business relationship with the contract manufacturers. These agreements and purchase orders have various terms and conditions and may be renewed or modified upon agreement by both parties. Their scope may also be expanded to include new products in the future.\nWe plan to expand our internal manufacturing capabilities and U.S.-based relationships, combined with other American manufacturers and suppliers where it furthers our business objectives. This strategy allows us to effectively manage quality, product costs and lead-times while focusing other resources on our core technological competencies of product design and development. We believe that, in certain circumstances, the use of experienced, high-quality, high-volume manufacturers can provide greater manufacturing specialization and expertise, higher levels of flexibility and responsiveness, and faster delivery of product, all of which contribute toward product cost control. To ensure that products manufactured by others meet our quality standards, our production and engineering team works closely with our contract manufacturers in all key aspects of the production process. We establish product specifications, select the components and, in some cases, the suppliers. We retain all document control. We also work with our contract manufacturers to improve process control and product design and conduct periodic on-site inspections.\nWe rely upon a limited number of both American and foreign suppliers for several key products and components. Approximately 65% of our material, subassembly and product procurements in 2020 were sourced from six suppliers. We place purchase orders from time to time with these suppliers and have no guaranteed supply arrangements. In addition, certain components are obtained from single sources. During 2020 and 2019, our operations were not materially impaired due to delays from single-source suppliers. However, the absence of a single-source component could potentially delay the manufacture of finished products. We manage the risk of such delays by securing secondary sources, where possible, and redesigning products in response to component shortages or obsolescence. We strive to maintain strong relationships with all of our suppliers. We anticipate that the current relationships, or others that are comparable, will be available to us in the future.\nSeasonal Impact\nWe may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results, in part, due to governmental customer spending patterns that are influenced by government fiscal year budgets and appropriations. We may also experience fluctuations in our quarterly results, derived, in part, from sales to federal and state agencies that participate in wildland fire-suppression efforts, which may be greater during the summer season when forest fire activity is heightened. In some years, these factors may cause an increase in sales for the second and third quarters, compared with the first and fourth quarters of the same fiscal year. Such increases in sales may cause quarterly variances in our cash flow from operations and overall financial results.\nSignificant Customers\nSales to the U.S. Government represented approximately 51% and 49% of our total sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These sales were primarily to various government agencies, including those within the DHS, the U.S. Department of Defense (\u201cDOD\u201d), the USFS and the U.S. Department of Interior (\u201cDoI\u201d).\nBacklog\nOur backlog of unshipped customer orders was approximately $5.9 million and $7.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in the backlog are attributed primarily to the timing and fulfillment of orders.\nCompetition\nWe compete with other domestic and foreign companies primarily in the North American market, but also internationally. One dominant competitor, Motorola Solutions, Inc., is estimated to have well in excess of half the market for LMR products. We compete by capitalizing on our advantages and strengths, which include price, product quality and customer responsiveness.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to various international and U.S. federal, state and local laws affecting our business. Any finding that we have been or are in noncompliance with such laws could result in, among other things, governmental penalties. Further, changes in existing laws or new laws may adversely affect our business and could also have the effect of limiting capital expenditures by our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with our U.S. Government contracts, we are subject to the U.S. Federal Government procurement regulations that may provide the buyer with the right to audit and review our performance, as well as our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, our business is subject to government regulation based on the products we sell that may be subject to government requirements, such as obtaining an export license or end-user certificate from the buyer, in certain circumstances. If a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, or if we are alleged to have violated any laws or regulations governing the products we sell under our government contracts, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with U.S. Federal Government agencies.\nOur products are regulated by the FCC in the U.S. and similar agencies in other countries where we offer our products. Consequently, we and our customers could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from time to time by the FCC or regulatory agencies in other countries. For example, our wireless communications products, including two-way LMRs, are subject to FCC regulations related to radio frequency spectrum. As a result of limited spectrum availability, the FCC has mandated that new LMR equipment utilize technology that is more spectrum-efficient, which effectively meant that the industry had to migrate to digital technology. These types of mandates may provide us with new business opportunities or may require us to modify all or some of our products so that they can continue to be manufactured and marketed, which may lead to an increase in our capital expenditures and research and development expenses.\nAs a public company, we are also subject to regulations of the SEC and the stock exchange on which we are listed (NYSE American).\nSome of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites, as well as relating to the protection of the environment. Certain of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products. During 2020, compliance with these U.S. federal, state and local and international laws did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 95 employees, most of whom are located at our West Melbourne, Florida facility; 46 of these employees are engaged in direct manufacturing or manufacturing support, 23 in engineering, 16 in sales and marketing, and 10 in headquarters, accounting and human resources activities. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements, nor has there ever been a labor-related work stoppage. We believe our relations with our employees are good.\nThe Company complies with all applicable state, local and international laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the Company operates. All applicants and employees are treated with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or protected veteran status.\nOur mission is to remain deeply rooted in the critical communications industry for all military, first responders, and public safety heroes. Our four guiding principles: growth, tenacious commitment to quality, continuous improvement, and a keen focus on being customer-centric, continuously drive our efforts to be the best partner for our customers, investment for our shareholders, neighbor in our community and to provide an empowering work environment for our employees.\nThe Company is committed to the health, safety and wellness of its employees. We have modified our business practices and implemented certain policies at our offices in accordance with best practices to accommodate, and at times mandate, social distancing and remote work practices, including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations, implementing social distancing and enhanced sanitary measures in our facilities, and cancelling attendance at events and conferences. In addition, we have invested in employee safety equipment, additional cleaning supplies and measures, re-designed production lines and workplaces as necessary and adapted new processes for interactions with our suppliers and customers to safely manage our operations.\nInformation Relating to Domestic and Export Sales\nThe following table summarizes our sales of LMR products by customer location:\nAdditional financial information is provided in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nVarious portions of this report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this report. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect subsequent events or circumstances or the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nWe depend on the success of our LMR product line\nWe currently depend on our LMR products as our sole source of sales. A decline in the price of and/or demand for LMR products, as a result of competition, technological change, the introduction of new products by us or others or a failure to manage product transitions successfully, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our future success will largely depend on the successful introduction and sale of our BKR Series product line, including our initial multiband product, which has been delayed from initial projections and which we may be unable to successfully complete in a timely manner, or at all. Even if we successfully develop and launch the BKR Series product line, or any other new products, the development of which is a complex and uncertain process requiring innovation and investment, such products may not achieve market acceptance, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are engaged in a highly competitive industry\nWe face intense competition from other LMR suppliers, and the failure to compete effectively could materially and adversely affect our market share, financial condition and results of operations. The largest supplier of LMR products in the world, Motorola Solutions, Inc., currently is estimated to have well in excess of half the market for LMR products. This supplier is also the world\u2019s largest supplier of P-25 products. Some of our competitors are significantly larger and have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have. Some also have established reputations for success in developing and supplying LMR products, including providing complete, integrated, communications systems and infrastructure. We do not provide complete, integrated, communications systems and infrastructure. These advantages may allow our competitors:\n\u25cf\nto be more attractive to customers who desire a single-source supplier of LMR products;\n\u25cf\nto respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, which may render our products obsolete or less marketable;\n\u25cf\nto engage in more extensive research and development;\n\u25cf\nto undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns;\n\u25cf\nto be able to take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities;\n\u25cf\nto adopt more aggressive pricing policies; and\n\u25cf\nto be more attractive to potential employees and strategic partners.\nSome of our competitors have established broad networks of sales locations and multiple distribution channels that are more extensive than ours. We may not be able to compete successfully and competitive pressures may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAn increase in the demand for P-25 products could benefit competitors that are better financed and positioned to meet such demand. P-25 products have been brought to the market by an increasing number of our competitors. Our first P-25 portable radio was brought to market in 2003, and in recent years we introduced two new lines of P-25 products, the KNG and KNG2 Series. We are currently developing a new line of P-25 digital products, the BKR Series, which we anticipate will include multiband products, among other new products. Bringing such products to market and achieving a significant market penetration for them will continue to require time and expenditures of funds, and we may be unable to successfully do so. We may be unsuccessful in developing and marketing, on a timely basis, fully functional product enhancements or new products that respond to these and other technological advances, and our new products may not be accepted by customers. An inability to successfully develop and/or market products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology and our success is dependent on our ability to adapt to such changes\nOur business could suffer if we are unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes and product development in our industry. The market for our LMR products is characterized by ongoing technological development, evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions. The LMR industry has largely transitioned from analog LMR products to digital LMR products in recent years. In addition, the APCO P-25 standard has been widely adopted. If we are unable to successfully keep up with these changes, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend heavily on sales to the U.S. Government\nWe are subject to risks associated with our reliance on sales to the U.S. Government. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 51% of our sales were to agencies and departments of the U.S. Government, including but not limited to, agencies of the DHS, DoA, DoD and DoI. We may be unable to maintain this government business. Our ability to maintain our government business will depend on many factors outside of our control, including competitive factors, changes in government personnel making contract decisions, spending limits and political factors. The loss of sales to the U.S. Government would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, most U.S. Government customers award business through a competitive bidding process, which results in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. The bidding process involves significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids for contracts that may not be awarded to us. Even if we are awarded contracts, we may fail to accurately estimate the resources and costs required to fulfill a contract, which could negatively impact the profitability of any contract awarded to us. In addition, following a contract award, we may experience significant expense or delay, contract modification or contract rescission as a result of customer delay or our competitors protesting or challenging contracts awarded to us in competitive bidding.\nAny delay, especially any prolonged delay, in the U.S. Government budget process or a government shutdown may result in us incurring substantial labor or other costs without reimbursement under our customer contracts, decrease the number of purchase orders issued under our contracts with government agencies, or result in the suspension of work on contracts in progress or in payment delays.\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is partially dependent on U.S. Government contracts, which are highly regulated and subject to terminations and oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives that could result in adverse findings and negatively impact our business\nOur U.S. Government business is subject to specific procurement regulations with numerous compliance requirements. These requirements, although customary in U.S. Government contracting, increase our performance and compliance costs. These costs may increase in the future, thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Failure to comply with these regulations could lead to suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for debarment are violations of various laws or policies, including those related to procurement integrity, U.S. Government security regulations, employment practices, protection of criminal justice data, protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper recording of costs, foreign corruption and the False Claims Act.\nGenerally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives and could result in adjustments to our contracts. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract or grant may not be allowed, and such costs already reimbursed to us may have to be refunded. Future audits and adjustments, if required, may materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in investigations, termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits or reimbursements, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. All contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the U.S. Government.\nIn addition, contacts with government officials and participation in political activities are areas that are tightly controlled by federal, state, local and international laws. Failure to comply with these laws could cost us opportunities to seek certain government sales opportunities or even result in fines, prosecution or debarment.\nOur business is subject to the economic, political, and other risks of manufacturing products in foreign countries\nWe engage in business with manufacturers located in other countries. Approximately 53% of our material, subassembly and product procurements in 2020 were sourced internationally. Accordingly, we are subject to special considerations and risks not typically associated with companies operating solely in the U.S. These include the risks associated with the political, economic, legal, health and other conditions in such foreign countries, among others. Our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected by, among other things, changes in the general political, social, health and economic conditions in foreign countries in which we maintain sourcing relationships, unfavorable changes in U.S. trade legislation and regulations, the imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business or other trade barriers, threats of war, terrorism or governmental instability, labor disruptions, the impact of public health epidemics on employees and the global economy, such as the coronavirus currently impacting China, which may cause our manufacturers or suppliers to temporarily suspend operations in the affected region, potentially negatively impacting our product launch timing and shipments, currency controls, fluctuating exchange rates with respect to contracts not denominated in U.S. dollars, and unanticipated or unfavorable changes in government policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflation measures and method of taxation. If we were unable to navigate foreign regulatory environments, or if we were unable to enforce our contract rights in foreign countries, our business could be adversely impacted. Any of these events could interrupt our manufacturing process and cause operational disruptions, increase prices for manufacturing, reduce our sales or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance.\nThe U.S. Government has indicated its intent to alter its approach to trade policy, including, in some instances, to revise, renegotiate or terminate certain multilateral trade agreements. It has also imposed new tariffs on certain foreign goods and raised the possibility of imposing additional increases or new tariffs on other goods. Such actions have, in some cases, led to retaliatory trade measures by certain foreign governments. Such policies could make it more difficult or costly for us to do business in or import our products from those countries. In turn, we may need to raise prices or make changes to our operations, which could negatively impact our revenue or operating results. At this time, it remains unclear what additional actions, if any, will be taken by the U.S. Government or foreign governments with respect to tariff and international trade agreements and policies, and we cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any revised trade agreements or any impact on our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing governmental responses have negatively impacted, and could further materially adversely affect, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) surfaced in Wuhan, China, which spread globally and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Although we believe the pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on our business in 2020, it may have the potential of doing so in the future. The extent of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and, given the continuing evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global responses to curb its spread, cannot be predicted. In addition, the pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty and caused a worldwide economic downturn. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of its national and, to some extent, global economic impact, including any recession that may occur in the future.\nIn response to COVID-19, national and local governments around the world instituted certain measures, including travel bans, prohibitions on group events and gatherings, shutdowns of certain businesses, curfews, shelter-in-place orders and recommendations to practice social distancing. Although many governmental measures have had specific expiration dates, some of those measures have already been extended more than once or re-implemented as cases of COVID-19 increased in certain areas; as a result, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration of such measures and potential future measures. Measures providing for business shutdowns generally exclude certain essential services, and those essential services commonly include critical infrastructure and the businesses that support that critical infrastructure, which includes our business. While our manufacturing operations have remained open, these measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, as well as those of our customers and suppliers.\nWe have modified our business practices and implemented certain policies at our offices in accordance with best practices to accommodate, and at times mandate, social distancing and remote work practices, including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations, implementing social distancing and enhanced sanitary measures in our facilities, and cancelling attendance at events and conferences. In addition, we have invested in employee safety equipment, additional cleaning supplies and measures, re-designed production lines and workplaces as necessary and adapted new processes for interactions with our suppliers and customers to safely manage our operations. Many of our suppliers and service providers have made similar modifications. If necessary, we may take further actions in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. In light of the economic downturn generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken steps to reduce expenses throughout the Company. These reductions have, at various junctures, included limiting travel, discontinuing participation in trade shows and other business meetings, instituting strict inventory control and decreasing expenditures. We restructured our operations to, among other things, reduce our workforce by approximately 18% during the second quarter of 2020. We incurred costs as a result of the workforce reduction, including approximately $221,000 in severance costs, which were recognized in the second quarter of 2020. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19, in which case our employees may become sick, our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed, and our business and operations could be negatively impacted. We have had two employees at our primary West Melbourne, Florida facility test positive for COVID-19 to-date. The employees were quarantined in accordance with accepted safety practices and returned to work only after clearing accepted health protocols. There was no disruption of our operations as a result of these occurrences. The resumption of normal business operations after such interruptions may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of COVID-19 on our suppliers, third-party service providers, and/or customers.\nIn addition, we have experienced delays and cost increases, and may continue to do so, in obtaining and transporting materials. Since the outbreak, some of our supply chain partners were temporarily closed for a period of time. These facilities have since reopened. Although we have in some cases experienced delays and increased freight costs, we have, to date, been able to procure the materials necessary to manufacture products and fulfill customer orders, which may not continue to be the case in the event the pandemic worsens or continues for an extended period of time. Depending on the continued progression of the pandemic, our ability to obtain necessary supplies, manufacture our products and ship finished products to customers may be disrupted.\nFurther, our current and potential customers\u2019 businesses could be disrupted or they could seek to limit spending, including shifting purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings or reducing their purchases and inventories due to decreased budgets, reduced access to credit or various other factors, any of which could negatively impact the willingness or ability of such customers to place new, or any, orders with us and ultimately adversely affect our revenues, as well as negatively impact the payment of accounts receivable and collections and potentially lead to write-downs or write-offs.\nThe ultimate duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and the related length of its impact on the global economy, which remain uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Furthermore, the extent to which our mitigation efforts are successful, if at all, is not presently ascertainable.\nWe carry substantial quantities of inventory, and inaccurate estimates of necessary inventory could materially harm our business, financial condition and operating results\nWe carry a significant amount of inventory to service customer requirements in a timely manner. If we are unable to sell this inventory over a commercially reasonable time, in the future we may be required to take inventory markdowns, which would reduce our net sales and/or gross margins. In addition, it is critical to our success that we accurately predict trends in customer demand, including seasonal fluctuations, in the future and do not overstock unpopular products or fail to sufficiently stock popular products. Both scenarios could materially harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event we fail to properly estimate our costs or hedge our risks associated with currency fluctuations\nWe sometimes enter into firm fixed-price contracts. If our initial cost estimates are incorrect, we can lose money on these contracts. Because certain of these contracts involve new technologies and applications, require us to engage subcontractors and/or can last multiple years, unforeseen events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with our subcontractors or suppliers and other cost overruns, can result in the contract pricing becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us and have an adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, a significant increase in inflation rates or currency fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the profitability of longer-term contracts.\nOur investment strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact our financial condition\nWe may invest part of our cash balances in public companies. For example, as of December 31, 2020, we held 477,282 shares of the common stock of FG Financial Group, Inc. (formerly 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc.) (Nasdaq: FGF) (\u201cFGF\u201d). These types of investments carry more risk than holding our cash balances as bank deposits or, for example, such conservative investments as treasury bonds or money market funds. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or enhance the value or the performance of the companies in which we have invested or in which we may invest in the future, or that we will be able to achieve returns or benefits from these investments. We may lose all or part of our investment relating to such companies if their value decreases as a result of their financial performance or for any other reason. If our interests differ from those of other investors in companies over which we do not have control, we may be unable to effect any change at those companies. We are not required to meet any diversification standards, and our investments may become concentrated. If our investment strategy is not successful or we achieve less than expected returns from these investments, it could have a material adverse effect on us. The Board of Directors may also change our investment strategy at any time, and such changes could further increase our exposure, which could adversely impact us.\nFG, with its affiliates, is our largest stockholder, and its interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders\nThe interests of FG may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. FG and its affiliates, owners and managers together hold approximately 34.3% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock. Kyle Cerminara, Chief Executive Officer, Partner and Manager of FG and Chairman of Ballantyne Strong, Inc., is a member of our Board of Directors. As a result of its ownership position and Mr. Cerminara\u2019s position with the Company, FG has the ability to exert significant influence over our policies and affairs, including the power to impact the election of our directors, and approval of any action requiring a stockholder vote, such as amendments to our articles of incorporation, by-laws, significant stock issuances, reorganizations, mergers and asset sales. FG may have interests that differ from those of our other stockholders and may vote in a way with which our other stockholders disagree and which may be adverse to their interests. FG\u2019s significant ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of the Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf we are unable to maintain our brand and reputation, our business, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed\nOur business, results of operations and prospects depend, in part, on maintaining and strengthening our brand and reputation for providing high-quality products and services. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions. Although reputations may take decades to build, any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. If problems with our products cause operational disruption or other difficulties, or there are delays or other issues with the delivery of our products or services, our brand and reputation could be diminished. Damage to our reputation could also arise from actual or perceived legal violations or product safety issues, cybersecurity breaches, actual or perceived poor employee relations, actual or perceived poor service, actual or perceived poor privacy practices, operational or sustainability issues, actual or perceived ethical issues or other events within or outside of our control that generate negative publicity with respect to us. Any event that has the potential to negatively impact our reputation could lead to lost sales, loss of new opportunities and retention and recruiting difficulties. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand and reputation successfully, our business, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed.\nWe face a number of risks related to challenging economic conditions\nCurrent economic conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere remain uncertain. These challenging economic conditions could materially and adversely impact our business, liquidity and financial condition in a number of ways, including:\n\u25cf\nPotential deferment or reduction of purchases by customers: Significant deficits and limited appropriations confronting our federal, state and local government customers may cause them to defer or reduce purchases of our products. Furthermore, uncertainty about current and future economic conditions may cause customers to defer purchases of our products in response to tighter credit and decreased cash availability. Additionally, any delay, especially any prolonged delay, in the U.S. Government budget process or government shutdown may negatively impact the ability of many of our customers to purchase our products and decrease the number of purchase orders issued under our contracts with government agencies.\n\u25cf\nNegative impact from increased financial pressures on third-party dealers, distributors and suppliers: We make sales to certain of our customers through third-party dealers and distributors. We generally do not require collateral from our customers. If credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvencies of these third parties and we are unable to successfully transition the end customers to purchase our products from other third parties, or directly from us, it could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. Challenging economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could negatively affect our ability to secure product to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\n\u25cf\nLimited access by us to credit and capital: The credit markets may limit our access to credit and impair our ability to raise capital, if needed, on acceptable terms or at all. From time to time, we also have cash in financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits, which funds might be at risk of loss should such financial institutions face financial difficulties.\nThe terms of the credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., contain restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility\nOn January 26, 2021, BK Technologies, Inc., our wholly-owned operating subsidiary, entered into a Note Modification Agreement (the \u201cModification\u201d) to renew its $5.0 million Credit Agreement and a related Line of Credit Note (the \u201cNote\u201d and collectively with the Credit Agreement, as modified by the Modification, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\u201cJPMC\u201d), which provides for a revolving line of credit through January 31, 2022. The Credit Agreement contains limitations and covenants that may limit BK Technologies, Inc.\u2019s ability to take certain actions, including pay dividends to us, enter into liens, indebtedness, loans and guarantees, acquisitions and mergers, or sales of assets, and engage in stock repurchases. It also contains one financial covenant requiring BK Technologies, Inc. to maintain a tangible net worth of at least $20.0 million at any fiscal quarter end. We are a guarantor of BK Technologies, Inc.\u2019s obligations under the Credit Agreement. Events beyond our control, including changes in general business and economic conditions, may impair BK Technologies, Inc.\u2019s ability to comply with these covenants, and a breach of any covenants may result in an event of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, JPMC may declare the entire unpaid balance immediately due and payable and/or exercise any and all remedial and other rights under the Credit Agreement. BK Technologies, Inc. may be unable to repay any accelerated indebtedness, and we may not be able to repay any indebtedness pursuant to the guarantee or refinance any accelerated indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. In general, the occurrence of any event of default under the Credit Agreement could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend on a limited number of manufacturers and on a limited number of suppliers of components to produce our products, and the inability to obtain adequate and timely delivery of supplies and manufactured products could have a material adverse effect on us\nWe contract with manufacturers to produce portions of our products, and our dependence on a limited number of contract manufacturers exposes us to certain risks, including shortages of manufacturing capacity, reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, production yield and costs. If any of our manufacturers terminate production or cannot meet our production requirements, we may have to rely on other contract manufacturing sources or identify and qualify new contract manufacturers. The lead-time required to qualify a new manufacturer could range from approximately two to six months. Despite efforts to do so, we may not be able to identify or qualify new contract manufacturers in a timely and cost-effective manner, and these new manufacturers may not allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. Any significant delay in our ability to obtain adequate quantities of our products from our current or alternative contract manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our dependence on limited and sole source suppliers of components involves several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components, price increases, late deliveries and poor component quality. Approximately 65% of our material, subassembly and product procurements in 2020 were sourced from six suppliers. We place purchase orders from time to time with these suppliers and have no guaranteed supply arrangements. Disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our products. The lead-time required for some of our components is up to as six months. If we are unable to accurately predict our component needs, or if our component supply is disrupted, we may miss market opportunities by not being able to meet the demand for our products. This may damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to manage our growth\nAcquisitions and other business transactions may disrupt or otherwise have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not have any acquisitions currently pending, and there can be no assurance that we will complete any future acquisitions or other business transactions or that any such transactions which are completed will prove favorable to our business. We intend to seek stockholder approval for any such transactions only when so required by applicable law or regulation. Any acquisitions of businesses and their respective assets also involve the risks that the businesses and assets acquired may prove to be less valuable than we expect and we may assume unknown or unexpected liabilities, costs and problems. We hope to grow rapidly, and the failure to manage our growth could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business plan contemplates, among other things, leveraging our products and technology for growth in our customer base and sales. This growth, if it materializes, could significantly challenge our management, employees, operations and financial capabilities. In the event of this expansion, we have to continue to implement and improve our operating systems and to expand, train, and manage our employee base. If we are unable to manage and integrate our expanding operations effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nRetention of our executive officers and key personnel is critical to our business\nOur key executives are critical to our success. The loss of services from any of our executive officers or other key employees due to any reason whatsoever could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success is also dependent upon our ability to hire and retain qualified operations, development and other personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, and we may be unable to hire or retain necessary personnel. The inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have had changes in our senior management team and other personnel over the past few years and have promoted or hired new employees to fill certain roles. Our inability to effectively integrate the newly-hired or promoted senior managers or other employees into our business process, controls and systems could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe rely on a combination of contract, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property rights, and failure to effectively utilize or successfully assert these rights could negatively impact us\nCurrently, we hold no U.S. patents. We have several trademarks related to the names \u201cBK Technologies,\u201d \u201cBK Radio\u201d, and \u201cRadios for Heroes\u201d. We have applied for a trademark related to the name \u201cBKR.\u201d As part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees, distributors and customers and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. We also rely on trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property rights. There is a risk that we may be unable to prevent another party from manufacturing and selling competing products or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property rights, and any additional rights we may obtain in the future, may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. It may also be particularly difficult to protect our products and intellectual property under the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold. Our failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could harm our competitive position and could negatively impact us.\nRising health care costs may have a material adverse effect on us\nThe costs of employee health care insurance have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative changes and general economic conditions. We cannot predict what other health care programs and regulations ultimately will be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict when or if Congress will repeal and/or replace certain health care programs and regulations at the federal level and the impact such changes would have on our business. A continued increase in health care costs could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures\nWe maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance, but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain.\nOur stock price is vulnerable to significant fluctuations, including due to our fluctuating quarterly operating results\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may be below the expectations of the investment community, resulting in volatility for the market price for our common stock. Other factors affecting the volatility of our stock price include:\n\u25cf\nfuture announcements concerning us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe announcement or introduction of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, including announcements regarding the status of our BKR Series product line;\n\u25cf\nchanges in product pricing policies by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in earnings estimates by us or our competitors or by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of our key personnel; and\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market is subject to price and volume fluctuations affecting the market price for the stock of many companies generally, which fluctuations often are unrelated to operating performance.\nNatural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other catastrophic events beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as fires, hurricanes, tornados, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes; geo-political events, such as civil unrest in a country in which our suppliers or manufacturers are located, or acts of war or terrorism (wherever located around the world) or military activities disrupting transportation, communication or utility systems or otherwise causing damage to our business, employees, suppliers, manufacturers and customers; or other highly disruptive events, such as nuclear accidents, pandemics, unusual weather conditions or cyber attacks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such events could result, among other things, in operational disruptions, physical damage to or destruction or disruption of one or more of our properties or properties used by third parties in connection with the supply of products or services to us, the lack of an adequate workforce in parts or all of our operations and communications and transportation disruptions. These factors could also cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets and economy. Such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us and could also have indirect consequences, such as increases in the costs of insurance, if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage.\nA security breach or other significant disruption of our information technology systems, or those of our distributors, manufacturers, suppliers and other partners, caused by cyber attack or other means, could have a negative impact on our operations, sales and results of operations\nFrom time to time, we may experience cyber attacks on our information technology systems and the information systems of our distributors, manufacturers, suppliers and other partners, whose systems we do not control. These systems are vulnerable to damage, unauthorized access or interruption from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to, continually evolving cyber attacks (including social engineering and phishing attempts), attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, cyber intrusion, computer viruses, security breach, misconduct by employees or other insiders with access to our data, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, sabotage, war and telecommunication failures. Cyber attacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated. Computer hackers and others might compromise our security measures, or security measures of those parties that we do business with now or in the future, and obtain the personal information of our customers, employees and partners or our business information. A cyber attack or other significant disruption involving our information technology systems or those of our distributors, manufacturers, suppliers or other partners, could result in disruptions in critical systems, corruption or loss of data, theft of data, funds or intellectual property, and unauthorized release of our or our customers\u2019 proprietary, confidential or sensitive information. Such unauthorized access to, or release of, this information could expose us to data loss, disrupt our operations, allow others to unfairly compete with us, subject us to litigation, government enforcement actions, regulatory penalties and costly response measures, and could seriously disrupt our operations. Any resulting negative publicity could also significantly harm our reputation. We may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate us for any losses associated with such events. Any or all of the foregoing could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or disable, degrade or sabotage, information technology systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate preventative measures or remediate any intrusion on a timely or effective basis. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these preventative and detective measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. We, therefore, remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or yet unknown threats, as in some instances, we, our distributors, manufacturers, suppliers and other partners, may be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We also face the risk that we expose our customers or partners to cybersecurity attacks. In addition, from time to time, we implement updates to our information technology systems and software, which can disrupt or shutdown our information technology systems. We may not be able to successfully integrate and launch these new systems as planned without disruption to our operations.\nThe risk of noncompliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us could materially adversely affect us\nFailure to comply with government regulations applicable to our business could result in penalties and reputational damage. Our products are regulated by the FCC and otherwise subject to a wide range of global laws. As a public company, we are also subject to regulations of the SEC and the stock exchange on which we are listed. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and increase our cost of doing business. Compliance with existing or future laws, including U.S. tax laws, could subject us to future costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, restrict what products and services we can offer, and generally impact our financial performance. Failure to comply with or to respond to changes in these requirements and regulations could result in penalties on us, such as fines, restrictions on operations or a temporary or permanent closure of our facility. These penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, existing or new regulatory requirements or interpretations could materially adversely impact us.\nWe may not be able to maintain our NYSE American listing\nOur common stock has been listed on the NYSE American since 2005. If we are unable to satisfy the continued listing standards of the NYSE American, which include, among others, minimum stockholders\u2019 equity, market capitalization, pre-tax income and per share sales price, our common stock may be delisted. If our common stock is delisted, we would be forced to have our common stock quoted on the OTC Markets or some other quotation medium, depending on our ability to meet the specific requirements of those quotation systems. In that case, we may lose some or all of our institutional investors, and selling our common stock on the OTC Markets would be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold and transactions could be delayed. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for shares of our common stock. If this happens, we will have greater difficulty accessing the capital markets to raise any additional necessary capital.\nAny infringement claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nAs the number of competing products available in the market increases and the functions of those products further overlap, the potential for infringement claims may increase. Any such claims, with or without merit, may result in costly litigation or require us to redesign the affected product to avoid infringement or require us to obtain a license for future sales of the affected product. Any of the foregoing could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any litigation resulting from any such claim could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant resources, including the efforts of our management and engineering personnel.\nWe have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to utilize under certain circumstances\nIf we incur future operating losses, we may be required to provide some or all of our deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance, resulting in additional non-cash income tax expense. The change in the valuation allowance may have a material impact on future net income or loss.\nWe may be unable to obtain components and parts that are verified to be Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) conflict-free, which could result in reputational damage\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (which are defined as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d) in our products and whether these materials originated from the DRC or an adjoining country. The SEC rules necessitate a complex compliance process and related administrative expense for a company once it determines a conflict mineral is necessary to the functionality or production of a product that the company manufactures or contracts to manufacture. These requirements could affect the sourcing, availability and cost of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products, and we may not be able to obtain conflict-free products or supplies in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices for our operations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs associated with complying with these supply chain due diligence procedures. In addition, because our supply chain is complex, if we discover that our products include minerals that have been identified as \u201cnot found to be DRC conflict-free\u201d or we are unable to determine whether such minerals are included in our products, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders as a result.\nAs a holding company, BK Technologies Corporation is dependent on the operations and funds of its subsidiaries\nOn March 28, 2019, we completed a reorganization pursuant to which BK Technologies Corporation became a holding company with no business operations of its own. BK Technologies Corporation\u2019s only significant assets are the outstanding equity interests in BK Technologies, Inc. and any other future subsidiaries of BK Technologies Corporation. As a result, we rely on cash flows from subsidiaries to meet our obligations, including payment of dividends to our stockholders. Additionally, our subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to BK Technologies Corporation, as the new holding company; for instance, the Credit Agreement permits BK Technologies, Inc. to pay dividends to us only if there is no default, and the payment of the dividends would not result in a default, under the Credit Agreement. The holding company reorganization was intended to create a more efficient corporate structure and increase operational flexibility. The anticipated benefits of this reorganization may not be obtained if circumstances prevent us from taking advantage of the opportunities that we expect it may afford us. As a result, we may incur the costs of a holding company structure without realizing the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price and impair our ability to raise equity capital\nApproximately 7.4 million (59.8%) of our shares of outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2020 were owned by certain of our executive officers and directors and other affiliates, and may be resold publicly at any time, subject to the volume and other restrictions under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Approximately 40.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2020 are freely tradable without restriction.\nSales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock, or even the potential for such sales, could lower the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities.",

    "item_7": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nBK Technologies Corporation is a holding company, with a wholly-owned operating subsidiary, BK Technologies, Inc. We design, manufacture and market American made two-way land mobile radios, repeaters, base stations and related components and subsystems. All operating activities are undertaken by BK Technologies, Inc.\nOur overall financial and operating results for 2020 improved markedly from the preceding year. Sales for 2020 grew over 10% compared with 2019, while gross profit margins as a percentage of sales increased by 2 percentage points year-over-year. Selling, general and administrative and administrative expenses for 2020 declined approximately $3.0 million, or 15.0%. The combined impact of sales growth, gross profit margin improvement, and reduced operating expenses yielded an increase of over $5.4 million in operating income from the prior year. Additionally, our balance sheet strengthened during the year with a $4 million (30%) reduction in inventory, which was a significant contributor to positive cash flow for the year of approximately $2.2 million. Meanwhile, we launched the first portable radio, the BKR 5000, in a new line of land mobile radio products, with additional models planned for 2021.\nTotal sales in 2020 grew 10.1% to approximately $44.1 million, compared with approximately $40.1 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily attributed to federal and state public safety agencies, some of which were new customers. We also realized sales from our new BKR 5000 portable radio, which was introduced during the third quarter of 2020.\nGross profit margin as a percentage of sales in 2020 increased to approximately 41.0%, compared with 39.0% for the previous year. The improvement was attributed primarily to the improved mix of product sales and reduced manufacturing costs.\nSelling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expenses for 2020 declined approximately $3.0 million (15.0%) to approximately $17.0 million, or 38.6% of sales, compared with $20.0 million, or 50.0% of sales, for 2019. The decrease in SG&A expenses was the result of broad-based cost reduction actions, including a reduction in our workforce.\nFor 2020, we recognized operating income of approximately $1.0 million , which was an improvement of $5.4 million from last year\u2019s operating loss of $4.4 million.\nWe recognized other expenses totaling approximately $797,000 in 2020, primarily attributed to an unrealized loss from our investment in FGF, made through FGI 1347 Holdings, LP, a consolidated variable interest entity. This compares with other income of $762,000 last year, which was primarily related to an unrealized gain from the investment in FGF.\nFor 2020, we recognized pretax income of approximately $251,000, a significant improvement from last year\u2019s pretax loss of approximately $3.6 million.\nWe recognized a tax expense of approximately $3,000 for 2020, compared with a benefit of approximately $987,000 for the prior year. The income tax benefit last year was largely non-cash as a result of deferred items.\nNet income for 2020 of approximately $248,000 ($0.02 per basic and diluted share), improved $2.9 million from last year\u2019s net loss of approximately $2.6 million ($0.21 per basic and diluted share).\nAs of December 31, 2020, working capital totaled approximately $15.1 million, of which $13.3 million was comprised of cash, cash equivalents and trade receivables. This compares with working capital totaling approximately $14.5 million at 2019 year-end, which included $8.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and trade receivables. During 2020, we fulfilled the limit of our stock repurchase program, repurchasing 117,942 shares of our common stock, utilizing cash of approximately $269,000.\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) surfaced, which spread globally and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy increased significantly in the first several months of 2020. In response to COVID-19, national and local governments around the world instituted certain measures, including travel bans, prohibitions on group events and gatherings, shutdowns of certain businesses, curfews, shelter-in-place orders and recommendations to practice social distancing. We are considered an \u201cessential business\u201d that is supporting first responders and our manufacturing operations remained open throughout the year. Accordingly, we have implemented certain policies at our offices in accordance with best practices to accommodate, and at times mandate, social distancing, wearing face masks, and remote work practices. Among other things, we have invested in employee safety equipment, additional cleaning supplies and measures, adjusted production lines and workplaces as necessary and adapted new processes for interactions with our suppliers and customers to safely manage our operations. To-date, two staff members at our primary facility in West Melbourne, FL tested positive for COVID-19. These employees were quarantined and worked remotely in accordance with accepted safety practices until after passing subsequent testing.\nIn planning for the possible disruption of our business, we have taken steps to reduce expenses throughout the Company. This included suspending all Company travel for a period of time, as well as our participation in trade shows and other business meetings, instituting strict inventory control and decreasing expenditures. We also implemented workforce reductions during the second quarter of 2020, decreasing employment and related expenses by approximately 18% as well as suspended the employer\u2019s 401K match. During the first nine months, impact to customer orders was limited as reflected by our sales, which increased compared with the same period last year. Also, while some of our supply chain partners were temporarily closed during the early stages of the pandemic, most of these partners resumed operations and we have been able to procure the materials necessary to manufacture products and fulfill customer orders. Depending on the progression of the pandemic, our ability to obtain necessary supplies and ship finished products to customers may be partly or completely disrupted. Continued progression of the pandemic could result in a decline in customer orders, as our customers could shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings or reduce their purchases and inventories due to decreased budgets, reduced access to credit or various other factors, and impair our ability to manufacture our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow. While the current impacts of COVID-19 are reflected in our results of operations, we cannot at this time separate the direct COVID-19 impacts from other factors that cause our performance to vary from year to year. The ultimate duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, and the related length of its impact on the global economy, which are uncertain and, given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global responses to curb its spread, cannot be predicted at this time. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of its national and, to some extent, global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. Furthermore, the extent to which our mitigation efforts are successful, if at all, is not presently ascertainable. However, we anticipate that our results of operations in future periods may continue to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its negative effects on global economic conditions. For additional risks relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part II of this report.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d). Among other things, the CARES Act includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. On April 13, 2020, we received an unsecured Loan (as defined below) in the amount of $2,196,335 under the Paycheck Protection Program (or \u201cPPP\u201d) established under the CARES Act, as further discussed below under \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d We intended to use the Loan for qualifying expenses in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act. At the time of application, we believed we qualified to receive the funds pursuant to the PPP.\nOn April 23, 2020, the SBA, in consultation with the Department of Treasury, issued new guidance that created uncertainty regarding the qualification requirements for a PPP loan. In April 2020, out of an abundance of caution, we repaid the Loan in full.\nOn May 4, 2020, the Company implemented workforce reductions of approximately 18% to reduce costs and to better position the Company in an uncertain business environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company incurred approximately $221,000 in severance costs relating to these workforce reductions, which were recognized in the second quarter of 2020 and was paid according to our normal payroll practices through September 2020.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results, in part, due to governmental customer spending patterns that are influenced by government fiscal year-end budgets and appropriations. We may also experience fluctuations in our quarterly results, in part, due to our sales to federal and state agencies that participate in wildland fire-suppression efforts, which may be greater during the summer season when forest fire activity is heightened. In some years, these factors may cause an increase in sales for the second and third quarters, compared with the first and fourth quarters of the same fiscal year. Such increases in sales may cause quarterly variances in our cash flow from operations and overall financial condition.\nResults of Operations\nAs an aid to understanding our operating results, the following table shows items from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of sales:\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared With Fiscal Year 2019\nSales, net\nDuring the year, procurement activities of some customers were likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, although the precise impact to sales cannot be quantified. Despite any such impact, sales for 2020 grew 10.1% ($4.0 million) to approximately $44.1 million, compared with approximately $40.1 million last year.\nThe increase in sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 was attributed primarily to federal and state public safety agencies, which included a combination of new and existing customers. Furthermore, during the year we launched, and generated sales from, the first product (BKR 5000) in the BKR Series, a new line of land mobile radios and solutions. Also, for comparative purposes, the prior year\u2019s sales were adversely impacted by the federal government shutdown early in the year.\nThe BKR Series is envisioned as a comprehensive line of new products with additional new models planned for 2021, including products with multi-band capability. The timing of developing additional BKR Series products and bringing them to market could be impacted by various factors, including potential impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. BKR Series products, we believe, should increase our addressable market by expanding the number of federal and other public safety customers that may purchase our products. However, the timing and size of orders from agencies at all levels can be unpredictable and subject to budgets, priorities and other factors. Accordingly, we cannot assure that sales will occur under particular contracts, or that our sales prospects will otherwise be realized.\nIn 2020, we reorganized our sales resources to focus more effectively on target markets and customers where we can realize sales success. The current funnel of sales prospects includes potential new customers in federal, state and local public safety agencies. We believe the reorganization and our sales funnel better positions us to capture new sales opportunities moving forward.\nWhile the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in coming months and quarters remain uncertain, such effects have the potential to adversely impact our customers and our supply chain. Such negative effects on our customers and suppliers could adversely affect our future sales, operations and financial results.\nCost of Products and Gross Profit Margin\nGross profit margins as a percentage of sales for 2020 was approximately 41.0%, compared with 39.0% for the prior year.\nOur cost of products and gross profit margins are primarily derived from material, labor and overhead costs, product mix, manufacturing volumes and pricing. The improvement in gross profit margins for 2020 compared with last year was attributed primarily to a more favorable sales mix of higher margin products. Furthermore, during the year we reduced manufacturing operations employment by approximately 21%, as well as other related expenses. These reductions, combined with increased production volumes, enabled us to better utilize and absorb our manufacturing support and overhead expenses, which favorably impacting gross profit margins.\nWe utilize a combination of internal manufacturing capabilities and contract manufacturing relationships for production efficiencies and to manage material and labor costs. In the future we anticipate expanding our utilization of internal manufacturing resources. We believe that our internal manufacturing capabilities and contract relationships or comparable alternatives will continue to be available to us. Although in the future we may encounter new product cost and competitive pricing pressures, the extent of their impact on gross margins, if any, is uncertain.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses consist of sales, marketing, commissions, engineering, product development, management information systems, accounting, headquarters and non-cash, share-based employee compensation expenses.\nSG&A expenses for 2020 decreased 15.0% ($3.0 million) to approximately $17.0 million, or 38.6% of sales, compared with approximately $20.0 million, or 50.0% of sales, for the previous year.\nEngineering and product development expenses for 2020 decreased $1.9 million, or 19.8%, to approximately $7.9 million (17.8% of sales), compared with approximately $9.8 million (24.5% of sales) for the previous year. Product development expenses related to an anticipated new line of portable and mobile radios with enhanced features, the BKR Series, continued to decrease as development activities migrated away from external resources to our new internal engineering team. This team is primarily involved with development of the BKR Series, including our planned multiband product. The precise date for developing and introducing new products is uncertain and can be impacted by, among other things, the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in coming months.\nMarketing and selling expenses for 2020 declined by approximately $1.0 million, or 19.0%, to approximately $4.2 million (9.5% of sales), compared with approximately $5.2 million (13.0% of sales) last year. The decreases are attributed to reductions in sales and go-to-market employment, as well as other sales and marketing related expenses.\nOther general and administrative expenses for 2020 totaled approximately $4.9 million (11.2% of sales), compared with approximately $5.0 million (12.5% of sales) for the previous year. Decreases in employment and other headquarters expenses were more than offset by non-recurring severance costs recognized in the second quarter of 2020 related to our reduction in employment.\nOperating Income (Loss)\nFor 2020, our operating income improved by $5.4 million to approximately $1.0 million (2.4% of sales), compared with an operating loss of approximately $4.4 million (10.9% of sales) for the prior year. The improved operating income for 2020 was primarily attributed to sales growth and higher gross profit margins combined with reduced employment and other operating expenses.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest (Expense) Income\nWe recorded net interest expense of approximately $8,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with net interest income of approximately $150,000 last year. Reduced interest income was primarily the result of lower cash balances and interest rates.\nGain/Loss on Investment in Securities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized an unrealized loss of $620,000 on our investment in FGF, compared with an unrealized gain of $716,000 for the previous year.\nOther Expense\nFor 2020, we recognized other expense totaling approximately $169,000, compared with approximately $104,000 last year. Other expenses were comprised primarily of foreign exchange transaction losses related to sales under a Canadian dollar-denominated contract and other investment management expenses.\nIncome Tax/Expense Benefit\nWe recorded an income tax expense of approximately $3,000 for 2020, compared with and income tax benefit of approximately $987,000 last year.\nOur income tax provision is based on management\u2019s estimate of the effective tax rate for the full year. The tax provision (benefit) in any period will be affected by, among other things, permanent, as well as temporary, differences in the deductibility of certain items, in addition to changes in tax legislation. As a result, we may experience significant fluctuations in the effective book tax rate (that is, tax expense divided by pre-tax book income) from period to period.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our net deferred tax assets totaled approximately $4.3 million, and were primarily derived from research and development tax credits, operating loss carryforwards and accrued expenses.\nIn order to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets, we will need to generate sufficient taxable income in future years. We analyze all positive and negative evidence to determine if, based on the weight of available evidence, we are more likely than not to realize the benefit of the net deferred tax assets. The recognition of the net deferred tax assets and related tax benefits is based upon our conclusions regarding, among other considerations, estimates of future earnings based on information currently available and current and anticipated customers, contracts and product introductions, as well as historical operating results and certain tax planning strategies.\nBased on our analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, we have concluded that we do not have the ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the necessary period to utilize the entire benefit for the deferred tax asset. Accordingly, we established a valuation allowance of $98,000. We cannot presently estimate what, if any, changes to the valuation of our deferred tax assets may be deemed appropriate in the future. If we incur future losses, it may be necessary to record additional valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets recognized as of December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $4.4 million, compared with cash used in operating activities of approximately $2.5 million last year. Cash provided by operating activities for 2020 was primarily related to net income and a decrease in inventory, combined with increases in depreciation and amortization, accrued compensation and related taxes, and deferred revenue, as well as an unrealized loss on our investment in FGF. These items were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, and a decrease in accrued warranty expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a net income of approximately $248,000, compared with a net loss of approximately $2.6 million for the prior year. Net inventories decreased during 2020 by approximately $4.1 million, compared with an increase of approximately $2.0 million for the prior year. The decrease for the year was primarily attributed to product sales combined with our inventory reduction program. Depreciation and amortization totaled approximately $1.3 million for 2020, compared with approximately $1.2 million for the prior year, primarily due to capital expenditures related to manufacturing and engineering equipment. Accrued compensation and related taxes for 2020 increased approximately $364,000, compared with a decrease of $743,000 last year. The increase in 2020 was the result of incentive compensation related to improved sales and operating results. Deferred revenue for 2020 increased approximately $585,000, compared with approximately $947,000 for the prior year, which was attributed primarily to the sales of extended warranties. Unrealized losses on securities for 2020 totaled approximately $620,000, compared with gains of approximately $716,000 for last year. For additional information pertaining to our investment in securities, refer to Note 6 (Investment in Securities) to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Accounts receivable for 2020 increased approximately $2.5 million, compared with a decrease of approximately $1.8 million last year. The increase for the current year was attributable to the timing of sales later in the year that had not yet completed their collection cycle. Accrued warranty expenses for 2020 decreased approximately $457,000, compared with approximately $298,000 last year. The decrease for the year is attributed primarily to manufacturing operations and quality improvements.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled approximately $946,000 and was attributed to purchases of property, plant and equipment. For the same period last year, cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $2.5 million, and was also attributed to purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash of approximately $1.3 million was used in financing activities. During the year we received proceeds totaling approximately $2.2 million under the PPP, which were repaid in full within the same period. We also used cash for our capital return program, which included quarterly dividends totaling approximately $1.0 million and stock repurchases totaling approximately $269,000. Our stock repurchase program terminated in April 2020 and was not renewed. Last year, approximately $1.0 million was used to pay dividends and approximately $1.0 million was used for stock repurchases. Last year we received $425,000 from U.S. Bank Equipment Finance for the purchase of manufacturing equipment items, pursuant to the Master Loan Agreement, described below.\nOn April 13, 2020, BK Technologies, Inc., our wholly-owned operating subsidiary, received approval and funding pursuant to a promissory note (the \u201cPPP Note\u201d) evidencing an unsecured loan in the amount of $2,196,335 (the \u201cLoan\u201d) under the PPP. The PPP was established under the CARES Act and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d). The Loan was made through JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\u201cJPMC\u201d). We intended to use the Loan for qualifying expenses in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act. At the time of application, we believed we qualified to receive the funds pursuant to the PPP.\nOn April 23, 2020, the SBA, in consultation with the Department of Treasury, issued new guidance that created uncertainty regarding the qualification requirements for a PPP loan. In April 2020, out of an abundance of caution, we repaid the loan in full.\nOn May 4, 2020, the Company implemented workforce reductions of approximately 18% to reduce costs and to better position the Company in an uncertain business environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company incurred approximately $221,000 in severance costs relating to these workforce reductions, which were recognized in the second quarter of 2020 and paid under our customary payroll practices through September 2020.\nOn January 30, 2020, BK Technologies, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a $5.0 million Credit Agreement and a related Line of Credit Note (the \u201cNote\u201d and collectively with the Credit Agreement, as modified by a Note Modification Agreement, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with JPMC. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving line of credit of up to $5.0 million, with availability under the line of credit subject to a borrowing base calculated as a percentage of accounts receivable and inventory. The line of credit was modified on January 26, 2021 to, among other things, extend the expiration date to January 31, 2022. Proceeds of borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. The line of credit is collateralized by a blanket lien on all personal property of BK Technologies, Inc. pursuant to the terms of the Continuing Security Agreement with JPMC. We and each subsidiary of BK Technologies, Inc. are guarantors of BK Technologies, Inc.\u2019s obligations under the Credit Agreement, in accordance with the terms of the Continuing Guaranty.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to one-month LIBOR (or zero if the LIBOR is less than zero) plus a margin of 1.90% (2.054% as of December 31, 2020). The line of credit, as modified, is to be repaid in monthly payments of interest only, payable in arrears, commencing on February 1, 2020, with all outstanding principal and interest to be payable in full at maturity, January 31, 2022.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain customary restrictive covenants, including restrictions on liens, indebtedness, loans and guarantees, acquisitions and mergers, sales of assets, and stock repurchases by BK Technologies, Inc. The Credit Agreement contains one financial covenant requiring BK Technologies, Inc. to maintain a tangible net worth of at least $20.0 million at any fiscal quarter end.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default, including: (1) failure to pay principal, interest or fees under the Credit Agreement when due and payable; (2) failure to comply with other covenants and agreements contained in the Credit Agreement and the other documents executed in connection therewith; (3) the making of false or inaccurate representations and warranties; (4) defaults under other agreements with JPMC or under other debt or other obligations of BK Technologies, Inc.; (5) money judgments and material adverse changes; (6) a change in control or ceasing to operate business in the ordinary course; and (7) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, JPMC may declare the entire unpaid balance immediately due and payable and/or exercise any and all remedial and other rights under the Credit Agreement.\nBK Technologies, Inc. was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2020 and the date of filing this report. As of December 31, 2020 and the date of filing this report, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement and there was approximately $5.0 million of borrowing available under the Credit Agreement.\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2020 was approximately $6.8 million. We believe these funds, combined with our cost-saving initiatives, anticipated cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our Credit Agreement, are sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We may, depending on a variety of factors, including market conditions for capital raises, the trading price of our common stock and opportunities for uses of any proceeds, engage in public or private offerings of equity or debt securities to increase our capital resources. However, financial and economic conditions, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could limit our access to credit and impair our ability to raise capital, if needed, on acceptable terms or at all. We also face other risks that could impact our business, liquidity and financial condition. For a description of these risks, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d set forth in this report.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 \u201cLeases,\u201d which amended leasing guidance by requiring companies to recognize a right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) asset and a lease liability for all operating and capital (finance) leases with lease terms greater than twelve months. The lease liability is equal to the present value of lease payments. The lease asset is based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment, such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, leases continue to be classified as operating or capital (finance), with lease expense in both cases calculated substantially the same as under the prior leasing guidance. The updated guidance became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2019. Adoption resulted in the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated financial statements. Based on the Company\u2019s lease portfolio as of January 1, 2019, which consisted solely of operating leases, the Company recognized approximately $2.9 million of ROU assets and $3.0 million of lease liabilities on its consolidated financial statements.. Refer to Note 7 (Leases) for further details on leases.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, \u201cIntangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract,\u201d to help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (hosting arrangement) by providing guidance for determining when the arrangement includes a software license. The amendments in ASU 2018-15 align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license). The accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the amendments in ASU 2018-15. The amendments in ASU 2018-15 became effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption was permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company adopted the new guidance in the fourth quarter of 2018, with no material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, \u201cDisclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement,\u201d which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, including the removal of certain disclosure requirements. The amendments in the ASU are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption was permitted upon issuance of the ASU. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2020, and the adoption did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur revenue recognition process and our more subjective accounting estimation processes affect our reported revenues and current assets and are, therefore, critical in assessing our financial and operating status. The processes for determining the allowance for collection of trade receivables, allowance for slow-moving, excess and obsolete inventory, allowance for product warranty, and income taxes involve certain assumptions that, if incorrect, could create an adverse impact on our operations and financial position.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $50,000 on gross trade receivables of approximately $6.5 million as of December 31, 2020, as compared with $50,000 on gross trade receivables of approximately $4.0 million as of December 31, 2019. This allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Because the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 cannot be known with certainty, we rely on prior experience. Our historical collection losses have typically been infrequent, with write-offs of trade receivables being significantly less than 1% of sales during past years. Accordingly, we have maintained a general allowance of up to approximately 5% of the gross trade receivables balance in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not indicate the inability to pay but turn out to have such an inability. Currently, our general allowance on trade receivables is approximately 0.8% of gross receivables. As revenues and total receivables increase, the allowance balance may also increase. We also maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible due to various reasons, such as bankruptcy and other customer liquidity issues. We analyze our trade receivables portfolio based on the age of each customer\u2019s invoice. In this way, we can identify those accounts that are more likely than not to have collection problems. We may reserve a portion or all of the customer\u2019s balance. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no specific allowance on trade receivables.\nSlow-moving, Excess and Obsolete Inventory\nThe allowance for slow-moving, excess and obsolete inventory was approximately $520,000 and $823,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe allowance for slow-moving, excess, and obsolete inventory is used to state our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Because the amount of inventory that we will actually recoup through sales cannot be known with certainty at any particular time, we rely on past sales experience, future sales forecasts and our strategic business plans. Generally, in analyzing our inventory levels, we classify inventory as having been used or unused during the past year and establish an allowance based upon several factors, including, but not limited to, business forecasts, inventory quantities and historical usage profile. Supplemental to the aforementioned analysis, specific inventory items are reviewed individually by management. Based on the review, considering business levels, future prospects, new products and technology changes, management, using its business judgment, may adjust the valuation of specific inventory items to reflect an accurate valuation estimate. Management also performs a determination of net realizable value for all finished goods with a selling price below cost. For all such items, the inventory is valued at not more than the selling price less cost, if any, to sell.\nAllowance for Product Warranty\nWe offer two-year standard warranties to our customers, depending on the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement. Our typical warranties require us to repair and replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the customer. At the time the product revenue is recognized, we record a liability for estimated costs under our warranties. The costs are estimated based on historical experience. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded liability for product warranties and adjust the amount as necessary.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized. The effect of changes in net deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the change is recognized. Valuation allowances are provided to the extent that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining whether a tax asset is realizable, we consider, among other things, estimates of future earnings based on information currently available, current and anticipated customers, contracts and new product introductions, as well as recent operating results and certain tax planning strategies. If we fail to achieve the future results anticipated in the calculation and valuation of net deferred tax assets, we may be required to increase the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets in the future.\nForward-Looking Statements\nWe believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our security holders and to the public. This report, therefore, contains statements about future events and expectations which are \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Sections 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and 21E of the Exchange Act, including the statements about our plans, objectives, expectations and prospects under the heading \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d You can expect to identify these statements by forward-looking words such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cmight,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d \u201care encouraged\u201d and other similar expressions.

Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: changes or advances in technology; the success of our LMR product line; successful introduction of new products and technologies, including our ability to successfully develop and sell our anticipated new multiband product and other related products in the planned new BKR Series product line; competition in the LMR industry; general economic and business conditions, including federal, state and local government budget deficits and spending limitations and any impact from a prolonged shutdown of the U.S. Government; the availability, terms and deployment of capital; reliance on contract manufacturers and suppliers; risks associated with fixed-price contacts; heavy reliance on sales to agencies of the U.S. Government and our ability to comply with the requirements of contracts, laws and regulations related to such sales; allocations by government agencies among multiple approved suppliers under existing agreements; our ability to comply with U.S. tax laws and utilize deferred tax assets; our ability to attract and retain executive officers, skilled workers and key personnel; our ability to manage our growth; our ability to identify potential candidates for, and consummate, acquisition, disposition or investment transactions, and risks incumbent to being a noncontrolling interest stockholder in a corporation; impact of our capital allocation strategy; risks related to maintaining our brand and reputation; impact of government regulation; rising health care costs; our business with manufacturers located in other countries, including changes in the U.S. Government and foreign governments\u2019 trade and tariff policies; our inventory and debt levels; protection of our intellectual property rights; fluctuation in our operating results and stock price; acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters and other catastrophic events; any infringement claims; data security breaches, cyber attacks and other factors impacting our technology systems; availability of adequate insurance coverage; maintenance of our NYSE American listing; risks related to being a holding company; and the effect on our stock price and ability to raise equity capital of future sales of shares of our common stock.\nAlthough we believe that the plans, objectives, expectations and prospects reflected in or suggested by our forward-looking statements are reasonable, those statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that our plans, objectives, expectations and prospects will be achieved.\nImportant factors that might cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements are contained in \u201cPart I-Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report and in our subsequent filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements made in this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise, after the date of this report.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nSee the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Stockholders\nBK Technologies Corporation\nWest Melbourne, Florida\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BK Technologies Corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As a part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAllowance for slow-moving and obsolete inventory\nAs disclosed in Note 1 of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, the Company records an estimated allowance for slow-moving, excess, and obsolete inventory to state the Company\u2019s inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company relies on, among other things, past usage/sales experience, future sales forecasts, and its strategic business plan to develop the estimate. As a result of management\u2019s assessment, the Company recorded an allowance for slow-moving, excess, and obsolete inventory of approximately $520,000 as of December 31, 2020.\nAuditing management\u2019s estimate of the allowance for slow-moving, excess, and obsolete inventory involved subjective evaluation and high degree of auditor judgement due to significant assumptions involved in estimating future inventory turnover and sales.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design of internal controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to recording inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We tested the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in calculating the allowance, including testing of a sample of inventory usage transactions, and recomputed the allowance calculation. We also evaluated the Company\u2019s ability to accurately estimate the assumptions used to develop the estimate by comparing historical allowance amounts to the history of actual inventory write-offs. Furthermore, we reviewed management\u2019s business plan and forecasts of future sales, including expected changes in technology and product lines.\nAssessment of Realizability of deferred tax assets\nAs disclosed in Note 8 of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, the Company records and measures net deferred tax assets based on estimated realizability. Valuation allowances are provided to the extent that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company recorded approximately $4.3 million in net deferred tax assets after valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020.\nAuditing management\u2019s assessment of realizability of deferred tax assets involved subjective estimation and high degree of auditor judgment in determining whether sufficient future taxable income, including projected pre-tax income, will be generated to support the realization of the existing deferred tax assets before expiration.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design of internal controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the realizability of deferred tax assets, including controls over management\u2019s projections of pre-tax income, and related entity-level controls. We also evaluated the assumptions used by the Company to develop projections of future taxable income, and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the projections, including comparing the projections of pre-tax income with the actual results of prior periods. In addition, we analyzed the nature of items giving rise to deferred tax assets and considered related expiration dates, as applicable. Furthermore, we evaluated management\u2019s analysis of current economic and industry trends, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and compared projections of future pre-tax income to other forecasted financial information prepared by management.\n/s/ MSL, P.A.\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2015.\nOrlando, Florida\nMarch 3, 2021\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share data)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(in thousands)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATIONYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share data and percentages)\n1.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nBK Technologies Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a holding company. The primary business of its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, BK Technologies, Inc., is the designing, manufacturing and marketing of wireless communications equipment primarily consisting of two-way land mobile radios and related products, which are sold in two primary markets: (1) the government and public safety market, and (2) the business and industrial market. The Company has only one reportable business segment.\nOn March 28, 2019, BK Technologies, Inc., the predecessor of BK Technologies Corporation, implemented a holding company reorganization, which resulted in BK Technologies Corporation becoming the direct parent company of, and the successor issuer to, BK Technologies, Inc. For the purpose of this report, references to the \u201cCompany\u201d or its management or business at any period prior to the holding company reorganization (March 28, 2019) refer to those of BK Technologies, Inc. as the predecessor company and its subsidiaries and thereafter to those of BK Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries, except as otherwise specified or to the extent the context otherwise indicates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accounts of the Company have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company consolidates entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. The Company determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d) or a voting interest entity.\nVIEs are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities independently, or (ii) the at-risk equity holders do not have the normal characteristics of a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest in a VIE is present when an enterprise has one or more variable interests that have both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The enterprise with a controlling financial interest is the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE.\nVoting interest entities lack one or more of the characteristics of a VIE. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority voting interest for a corporation or a majority of kick-out or participating rights for a limited partnership.\nWhen the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but exerts significant influence over the entity\u2019s operating and financial policies (generally defined as owning a voting or economic interest of between 20% to 50%), the Company\u2019s investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. If the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in, or exert significant influence over, an entity, the Company accounts for its investment at fair value, if the fair value option was elected, or at cost.\nThe Company has an investment in FG Financial Group, Inc. (formerly 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc.), made through FGI 1347 Holdings, LP, a consolidated VIE (see Note 6).\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined by the average cost method) or net realizable value. Freight costs are classified as a component of cost of products in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATIONYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share data and percentages)\n1.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nThe allowance for slow-moving, excess, and obsolete inventory is used to state the Company\u2019s inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Because the amount of inventory that will actually be recouped through sales cannot be known with certainty at any particular time, the Company relies on past sales experience, future sales forecasts, and its strategic business plans. Generally, in analyzing inventory levels, inventory is classified as having been used or unused during the past year. The Company then establishes an allowance based upon several factors, including, but not limited to, business forecasts, inventory quantities and historic usage profile.\nSupplemental to the aforementioned analysis, specific inventory items are reviewed individually by management. Based on the review, considering business levels, future prospects, new products and technology changes, management, using its business judgment, may adjust the valuation of specific inventory items to reflect an accurate valuation estimate. Management also performs a determination of net realizable value for all finished goods with a selling price below cost. For all such items, the inventory is valued at not more than the selling price less cost, if any, to sell.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations for the period.\nDepreciation and amortization are generally computed on the straight-line method using lives of 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment and 5 to 8 years for leasehold improvements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nManagement regularly reviews long-lived assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value, which considers the discounted future net cash flows. No long-lived assets were considered impaired at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that the Company believes to be uncollectible. The Company also records an additional allowance based on certain percentages of the Company\u2019s aged receivables, which are determined based on historical experience and the Company\u2019s assessment of the general financial conditions affecting the Company\u2019s customer base. If the Company\u2019s actual collections experience changes, revisions to the Company\u2019s allowance may be required. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on the information available, management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 is adequate.\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATIONYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share data and percentages)\n1.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenues in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d and the additional related ASUs (\u201cASC 606\u201d), which replaced previous revenue guidance and outlines a single set of comprehensive principles for recognizing revenue under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). These standards provide guidance on recognizing revenue, including a five-step method to determine when revenue recognition is appropriate:\nStep 1: Identify the contract with the customer;\nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract;\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price;\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and\nStep 5: Recognize revenue as the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nASC 606 provides that sales revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company generally satisfies performance obligations upon shipment of the product or service to the customer. This is consistent with the time in which the customer obtains control of the product or service. For extended warranties, sales revenue associated with the warranty is deferred at the time of sale and later recognized on a straight-line basis over the extended warranty period. Some contracts include installation services, which are completed in a short period of time and the revenue is recognized when the installation is complete. Customary payment terms are granted to customers, based on credit evaluations. Currently, the Company does not have any contracts where revenue is recognized, but the customer payment is contingent on a future event.\nThe Company periodically reviews its revenue recognition procedures to assure that such procedures are in accordance with GAAP. Surcharges collected on certain sales to government customers and remitted to governmental agencies are not included in revenues or in costs and expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method specified by GAAP. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized. The effect of changes in net deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the change is recognized. Valuation allowances are provided to the extent that impairment of tax assets is more likely than not. In determining whether a tax asset is realizable, the Company considers, among other things, estimates of future earnings based on information currently available, current and anticipated customers, contracts and new product introductions, as well as recent operating results and certain tax planning strategies. If the Company fails to achieve the future results anticipated in the calculation and valuation of net deferred tax assets, the Company may be required to increase the valuation allowance related to its deferred tax assets in the future.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers\u2019 financial condition and generally does not require collateral. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, accounts receivable from governmental customers were approximately $2,102 and $353, respectively. Generally, receivables are due within 30 days. Credit losses relating to customers have been consistently within management\u2019s expectations.\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATIONYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share data and percentages)\n1.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nThe Company primarily maintains cash balances at one financial institution. Accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) up to $250. From time to time, the Company has had cash in financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents in excess of FDIC limits of $6,576.\nManufacturing and Raw Materials\nThe Company relies upon a limited number of manufacturers to produce its products and on a limited number of component suppliers. Some of these manufacturers and suppliers are in other countries. Approximately 53.0% of the Company\u2019s material, subassembly and product procurements in 2020 were sourced internationally, of which approximately 48.0% were sourced from three suppliers. For 2019, approximately 67.0% of the Company\u2019s material, subassembly and product procurements were sourced internationally, of which approximately 64.0% were sourced from three suppliers. Purchase orders denominated in U.S. dollars are placed with these suppliers from time to time and there are no guaranteed supply arrangements or commitments.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include accounts receivable allowances, inventory obsolescence allowance, warranty allowance, and income tax accruals. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company\u2019s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, investment in securities, accounts payable, accrued expenses, notes payable, and other liabilities. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, notes payable, and other liabilities approximated their respective fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments.\nThe Company uses observable market data assumptions (Level 1 inputs, as defined in accounting guidance) that it believes market participants would use in pricing investment in securities.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nShipping and handling costs are classified as a part of cost of products in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Amounts billed to a customer, if any, for shipping and handling are reported as revenue.\nAdvertising and Promotion Costs\nThe cost for advertising and promotion is expensed as incurred. Advertising and promotion expenses are classified as part of selling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, such expenses totaled $214 and $555, respectively.\nEngineering, Research and Development Costs\nIncluded in SG&A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are engineering, research and development costs of $7,869 and $9,803, respectively.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based arrangements in accordance with GAAP, which requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service.\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATIONYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share data and percentages)\n1.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nRestricted Stock Units\nOn August 24, 2020, the Company granted to each non-employee director restricted stock units with a grant-date fair value of $40 per award (resulting in total aggregate grant-date fair value of $240), which will vest in five equal, annual installments beginning with the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to the director\u2019s continued service through such date, provided that, if the director makes himself available and consents to be nominated by the Company for continued service as a director, but is not nominated for the Board for election by stockholders, other than for good reason, as determined by the Board in its discretion, then the restricted stock units shall vest in full as of the director\u2019s last date of service as a director of the Company.\nOn April 24, 2020, upon the resignation of former director Ryan Turner, the Company, at the direction of the Board of Directors, accelerated the vesting of Mr. Turner\u2019s unvested restricted stock units granted September 6, 2019 and issued 10,389 shares of common stock.\nOn September 6, 2019, the Company granted to each non-employee director restricted stock units with a grant-date fair value of $40 per award (resulting in total aggregate grant-date fair value of $280), which will vest in five equal, annual installments beginning with the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to the director\u2019s continued service through such date, provided that, if the director makes himself available and consents to be nominated by the Company for continued service as a director, but is not nominated for the Board for election by stockholders, other than for good reason, as determined by the Board in its discretion, then the restricted stock units shall vest in full as of the director\u2019s last date of service as a director of the Company.\nOn September 6, 2018, the Company granted to each non-employee director restricted stock units with a grant-date fair value of $20 per award (resulting in total aggregate grant-date fair value of $140), which vest in five equal, annual installments beginning with the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to the director\u2019s continued service through such date, provided that, if the director makes himself available and consents to be nominated by the Company for continued service as a director, but is not nominated for the Board for election by stockholders, other than for good reason, as determined by the Board in its discretion, then the restricted stock units vest in full as of the director\u2019s last date of service as a director of the Company.

On April 24, 2020, upon the resignation of Mr. Turner, the Company accelerated the vesting of Mr. Turner\u2019s unvested restricted stock units granted September 6, 2018 and issued 4,050 shares of common stock.\nOn June 4, 2018, the Company granted to each non-employee director restricted stock units with a grant fair value of $20 per award (resulting in total aggregate grant-date fair value of $140), which vested on June 4, 2019.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nEarnings (loss) per share amounts are computed and presented for all periods in accordance with GAAP.\nComprehensive Income (loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) was equal to net income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nProduct Warranty\nThe Company offers two-year standard warranties to its customers, depending on the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement. The Company\u2019s typical warranties require it to repair and replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the customer. At the time the product revenue is recognized, the Company records a liability for estimated costs under its warranties. The costs are estimated based on historical experience. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded liability for product warranties and adjusts the amount as necessary.\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATIONYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share data and percentages)\n1.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 \u201cLeases,\u201d which amended leasing guidance by requiring companies to recognize a right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) asset and a lease liability for all operating and capital (finance) leases with lease terms greater than twelve months. The lease liability is equal to the present value of lease payments. The lease asset is based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment, such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, leases continue to be classified as operating or capital (finance), with lease expense in both cases calculated substantially the same as under the prior leasing guidance. The updated guidance became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2019. Adoption resulted in the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated financial statements. Based on the Company\u2019s lease portfolio as of January1, 2019, which consisted solely of operating leases, the Company recognized approximately $2,885 of ROU assets and $2,975 of lease liabilities on its consolidated financial statements.. Refer to Note 7 (Leases) for further details on leases.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, \u201cIntangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract,\u201d to help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (hosting arrangement) by providing guidance for determining when the arrangement includes a software license. The amendments in ASU 2018-15 align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license). The accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the amendments in ASU 2018-15. The amendments in ASU 2018-15 became effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption was permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company adopted the new guidance in the fourth quarter of 2018, with no material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, \u201cDisclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement,\u201d which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, including the removal of certain disclosure requirements. The amendments in the ASU are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2020, and the adoption did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATIONYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share data and percentages)\n2.\nInventories, net\nInventories, which are presented net of allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventory, consisted of the following:\nChanges in the allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventory are as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company wrote off obsolete inventory that had been fully allowed for previously, which had no material impact to the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of operations.\n3.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nChanges in the allowance for doubtful accounts are composed of the following:\n4.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net\nProperty, plant and equipment, net include the following:\nDepreciation and amortization expense relating to property, plant and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $1,344 and $1,219, respectively. During the year ended 31, 2020, the company removed from its records approximately $1,400 of fully depreciated machinery and equipment.\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATIONYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share data and percentages)\n5.\nDebt\nOn January 30, 2020, BK Technologies, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a $5,000 Credit Agreement and a related Line of Credit Note (the \u201cNote\u201d and collectively with the Credit Agreement, as modified by that certain Note Modification Agreement dated as of January 26, 2021, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\u201cJPMC\u201d).\nThe Credit Agreement provides for a revolving line of credit of up to $5,000, with availability under the line of credit subject to a borrowing base calculated as a percentage of accounts receivable and inventory. The line of credit, as modified by the Note Modification Agreement, expires on January 31, 2022. Proceeds of borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. The line of credit is collateralized by a blanket lien on all personal property of BK Technologies, Inc. pursuant to the terms of the Continuing Security Agreement with the Lender. The Company and each subsidiary of BK Technologies, Inc. are guarantors of BK Technologies, Inc.\u2019s obligations under the Credit Agreement, in accordance with the terms of the Continuing Guaranty.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to one-month LIBOR or zero if the LIBOR is less than zero) plus a margin of 1.90% (2.054% as of December 31, 2020). The line of credit, as modified, is to be repaid in monthly payments of interest only, payable in arrears, commencing on February 1, 2020, with all outstanding principal and interest to be payable in full at maturity (January 31, 2022).\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain customary restrictive covenants, including restrictions on liens, indebtedness, loans and guarantees, acquisitions and mergers, sales of assets, and stock repurchases by BK Technologies, Inc. The Credit Agreement contains one financial covenant requiring BK Technologies, Inc. to maintain a tangible net worth of at least $20,000 at any fiscal quarter end.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default, including: (1) failure to pay principal, interest or fees under the Credit Agreement when due and payable; (2) failure to comply with other covenants and agreements contained in the Credit Agreement and the other documents executed in connection therewith; (3) the making of false or inaccurate representations and warranties; (4) defaults under other agreements with JPMC or under other debt or other obligations of BK Technologies, Inc.; (5) money judgments and material adverse changes; (6) a change in control or ceasing to operate business in the ordinary course; and (7) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, JPMC may declare the entire unpaid balance immediately due and payable and/or exercise any and all remedial and other rights under the Credit Agreement.\nBK Technologies, Inc. was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2020 and the date of filing this report. As of December 31, 2020 and the date of filing this report, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.\nOn September 25, 2019, BK Technologies, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of BK Technologies Corporation, and U.S. Bank Equipment Finance, a division of U.S. Bank National Association, as a lender, entered into a Master Loan Agreement in the amount of $425 to finance various items of equipment.

FGI 1347 Holdings, LP was established for the purpose of investing in securities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company indirectly held approximately $110 in cash and 477,282 shares of FG Financial Group, Inc. (formerly 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc.) (Nasdaq: FGF) with fair value of $2,014, through an investment in FGI 1347 Holdings, LP. These shares were purchased in March and May 2018 for approximately $3,741.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized a loss of approximately $620 and a gain of approximately $716, respectively, due to changes in the unrealized loss on investment in securities.\nAffiliates of Fundamental Global Investors, LLC (\u201cFG \u201d) serve as the general partner and the investment manager of 1347 LP, and the Company is the sole limited partner. As the sole limited partner, the Company is entitled to 100% of net assets held by 1347 LP. The general partner of 1347 LP is entitled to a management fee from 1347 LP. There were no fees paid to the general partner or its affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the Company and the affiliates of FG, including, without limitation, Ballantyne Strong, Inc., beneficially owned in the aggregate 3,109,891 shares of FGF\u2019s common stock, representing approximately 62.7% of FGF\u2019s outstanding shares.

Mr. Kyle Cerminara, a member of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, is Chief Executive Officer, Co-Founder and Partner of FG and serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ballantyne Strong, Inc. Mr. Cerminara also serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors of FGF.\n7.\nLeases\nThe Company leases approximately 54,000 square feet (not in thousands) of industrial space in West Melbourne, Florida, under a non-cancellable operating lease. The lease has the expiration date of June 30, 2027. Rental, maintenance and tax expenses for this facility were approximately $510 and $502 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company also leases 8,100 square feet (not in thousands) of office space in Lawrence, Kansas, to accommodate a portion of the Company\u2019s engineering team. In November 2019, this lease was amended to extend the lease term until December 31, 2021. Rental, maintenance and tax expenses for this facility were approximately $124 and $108 in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATIONYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share data and percentages)\n7.\nLeases (Continued)\nIn February 2020, the Company entered into a lease for 6,857 (not in thousands) square feet of office space at Sawgrass Technology Park, 1619 NW 136th Avenue in Sunrise, Florida, for a period of 64 months. The commencement date for this lease was July 1, 2020. Rental, maintenance, and tax expenses for the facility were $169 in 2020.\nThe Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, \u201cLeases\u201d (Topic 842) on January 1, 2019 and applied the modified retrospective approach to adoption whereby the standard is applied only to the current and future periods. The Company leases manufacturing and office facilities and equipment under operating leases and determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. ROU assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.\nAs most of its leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company\u2019s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately.\nLease costs consist of the following:\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATIONYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share data and percentages)\n7.\nLeases (Continued)\nOther information related to operating leases was as follows:\nMaturity of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:\n8.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax expense (benefit) is summarized as follows:\nA reconciliation of the statutory U.S. income tax rate to the effective income tax rate follows:\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATIONYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share data and percentages)\n8.\nIncome Taxes (Continued)\nThe components of the deferred income tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had a net deferred tax asset of approximately $5,000 offset by deferred tax liabilities of $700 derived from accelerated tax depreciation. This asset is primarily composed of net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d), research and development tax credits, and deferred revenue, net of a valuation allowance of approximately $98. The NOLs total approximately $4,829 for federal and $6,332 for state purposes, with expirations starting in 2021 for state purposes. State NOLs of $648 expired in 2020.\nDuring 2019, the Company generated $5,006 of federal NOLs and during 2020, the Company expects to use $176 of available federal NOLs. The deferred tax asset amounts are based upon management\u2019s conclusions regarding, among other considerations, the Company\u2019s current and anticipated customer base, contracts, and product introductions, certain tax planning strategies, and management\u2019s estimates of future earnings based on information currently available, as well as recent operating results during 2020, 2019, and 2018. GAAP requires that all positive and negative evidence be analyzed to determine if, based on the weight of available evidence, the Company is more likely than not to realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset.\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATIONYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share data and percentages)\n8.\nIncome Taxes (Continued)\nManagement\u2019s analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, provides support that the Company does not have the ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the necessary period to utilize the entire benefit for the deferred tax asset. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2020, a valuation allowance has been established totaling approximately $98.\nShould the factors underlying management\u2019s analysis change, future valuation adjustments to the Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset may be necessary. If future losses are incurred, it may be necessary to record an additional valuation allowance related to the Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset recorded as of December 31, 2020. It cannot presently be estimated what, if any, changes to the valuation of the Company\u2019s deferred tax asset may be deemed appropriate in the future. The 2020 federal and state NOLs and tax credit carryforwards could be subject to limitation if, within any three-year period prior to the expiration of the applicable carryforward period, there is a greater than 50% change in ownership of the Company by any stockholder with 5% or greater ownership.\nThe Company performed a comprehensive review of its portfolio of uncertain tax positions in accordance with recognition standards established by GAAP. In this regard, an uncertain tax position represents the Company\u2019s expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return or planned to be taken in a future tax return that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. As a result of this review, on January 1, 2021, the Company is not aware of any uncertain tax positions that would require additional liabilities or which such classification would be required. The amount of unrecognized tax positions did not change as of December 31, 2020, and the Company does not believe there will be any material changes in its unrecognized tax positions over the next twelve months.\nPenalties and tax-related interest expense, of which there were no material amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, are reported as a component of income tax expense (benefit).\nThe Company files federal income tax returns, as well as multiple state and local jurisdiction tax returns. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution on any particular uncertain tax position, the Company believes that its allowances for income taxes reflect the most probable outcome. The Company adjusts these allowances, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. The resolution of a matter would be recognized as an adjustment to the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period of resolution. The calendar years 2017, 2018, and 2019 are still open to IRS examination under the statute of limitations. The last IRS examination on the Company\u2019s 2007 calendar year was closed with no change.\n9.\nIncome (Loss) Per Share\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted loss per share:\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATIONYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share data and percentages)\n9.\nLoss Per Share (Continued)\nApproximately 464,000 stock options and 139,233 restricted stock units for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 569,500 stock options and 101,073 restricted stock units for the year ended December 31, 2019, were excluded from the calculation because they were anti-dilutive.\n10.\nShare-Based Employee Compensation\nThe Company has an employee and non-employee director incentive compensation equity plan. Related to these programs, the Company recorded $129 and $148 of share-based employee compensation expense during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which is included as a component of cost of products and SG&A expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. No amount of share-based employee compensation expense was capitalized as part of capital expenditures or inventory for the years presented.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model to calculate the fair value of a stock option grant. The share-based employee compensation expense recorded in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was calculated using the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock over the period of time, commensurate with the expected life of the stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company\u2019s expectations of dividend payouts at the grant date. In 2020, the Company paid dividends on January 17, for a dividend declared in 2019, April 13, July 20 and October 19. In December 2020, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend that was paid on January 19, 2021. The Company has estimated its future stock option exercises. The expected term of option grants is based upon the observed and expected time to the date of post vesting exercises and forfeitures of options by the Company\u2019s employees. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the average U.S. Treasury rate for the period, which approximates the rate at the time of the stock option grant.\nBK TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATIONYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share data and percentages)\n10.\nShare-Based Employee Compensation (Continued)\nA summary of stock option activity under the Company\u2019s equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2020, and changes during the year ended December 31, 2020, are presented below:\nOutstanding:\nExercisable:\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value per option granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1.27 and $1.64, respectively.

Although we believe the pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on our business through the first three quarters of 2020, it may have the potential of doing so in the future. The extent of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and, given the continuing evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global responses to curb its spread, cannot be predicted. In addition, the pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty and caused a worldwide economic downturn. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of its national and, to some extent, global economic impact, including any recession that may occur in the future.\n14.\nCapital Program\nIn May 2016, the Company implemented a capital return program that included a stock repurchase program and a quarterly dividend. Under the program, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to 500,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock pursuant to a stock repurchase plan in conformity with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In June 2017, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the Company\u2019s capital return program, authorizing the repurchase of 500,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in addition to the 500,000 shares originally authorized, for a total repurchase authorization of one million shares, pursuant to a stock repurchase plan in conformity with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Based on that evaluation, the President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to a change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nAn internal control material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected.\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. In making the assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",
