The evaluations assessed the effectiveness of the Registrants\u2019 disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluations, each PEO and PFO has concluded that, as to the Registrant or Registrants for which they serve as PEO or PFO, the Registrant\u2019s or Registrants\u2019 disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by each Registrant in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms; and that the Registrant\u2019s or Registrants\u2019 disclosure controls and procedures are also effective in reasonably assuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Registrant\u2019s or Registrants\u2019 management, including their respective PEOs and PFOs, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)\nThe managements of Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy (individually \u201cRegistrant\u201d and collectively the \u201cRegistrants\u201d) are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Registrants. Each Registrant\u2019s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of each Registrant\u2019s financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nEach Registrant\u2019s management assessed the effectiveness of each Registrant\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, each Registrant\u2019s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. The 2013 COSO Framework was utilized for management\u2019s assessment.\nBased on each management\u2019s assessment and the criteria set forth by the 2013 COSO Framework, each Registrant\u2019s management believes that each Registrant maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.\nThe report of Deloitte & Touche LLP, Entergy Corporation\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, regarding Entergy Corporation\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is included herein. The report of Deloitte & Touche LLP is not applicable to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy because these Registrants are non-accelerated filers.\nChanges in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of each Registrant\u2019s management, including its respective PEO and PFO, each Registrant evaluated changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 and found no change that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.\nAttestation Report of Registered Public Accounting Firm\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and Board of Directors of\nEntergy Corporation and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries (the \u201cCorporation\u201d) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 of the Corporation and our report dated February 26, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Corporation\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Item 9A, Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nFebruary 26, 2021\nPART III",

It also explains how and why the Personnel Committee of Entergy Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors arrived at the specific compensation decisions involving the NEOs in 2020 who were:\n(1)Messrs. Bakken, Brown, Denault, Marsh, and West hold the positions referenced above as executive officers of Entergy Corporation and are members of Entergy Corporation\u2019s Office of the Chief Executive (\u201cOCE\u201d). No additional compensation was paid in 2020 to any of these officers for their service as NEOs of the Utility operating companies.\nEntergy Corporation\u2019s Compensation Principles and Philosophy\nEntergy Corporation\u2019s executive compensation programs are based on a philosophy of pay for performance that supports its strategy and business objectives. It believes the executive pay programs:\n\u2022Motivate its management team to drive strong financial and operational results by linking pay to performance.\n\u2022Attract and retain a highly experienced, diverse and successful management team.\n\u2022Incentivize and reward the achievement of results that are deemed by the Personnel Committee to be consistent with the overall goals and strategic direction that the Entergy Corporation Board has approved.\n\u2022Create sustainable value for the benefit of all of Entergy Corporation\u2019s stakeholders, including its customers, employees, communities and owners.\n\u2022Align the interests of the executives and Entergy Corporation\u2019s investors in its long-term business strategy by directly tying the value of equity-based awards to Entergy Corporation\u2019s stock price performance and relative total shareholder return.\nExecutive Compensation Best Practices:\nEntergy Corporation regularly reviews its executive compensation programs to align them with commonly viewed best practices in the market and to reflect feedback from discussions with Entergy Corporation\u2019s investors on executive compensation.\nHow Entergy Corporation Makes Compensation Decisions\nThe Personnel Committee oversees the executive compensation programs and policies with the advice of its independent compensation consultant and support from Entergy Corporation\u2019s management team.\n2021 Executive Compensation Program Enhancements\nAnnual Incentive Awards. Feedback from Entergy Corporation\u2019s investors has indicated that environmental, social and governance (or ESG) issues are being viewed as increasingly vital to long-term performance. In addition, investors are expecting more transparency regarding corporate ESG commitments. This echoes Entergy Corporation\u2019s own commitment to ESG and all of its critical stakeholders. Thus, Entergy Corporation conducted a comprehensive review of its incentive program in 2020 to identify and prioritize the optimal incentive metrics - including ESG goals - to use in the 2021 program. Historically, Entergy Corporation has used two financial measures to determine the Entergy Achievement Multiplier (\u201cEAM\u201d), which is the performance metric used to determine the maximum funding available for annual incentive awards. ESG and other performance metrics were considered in determining the allocation of incentive funds to certain workgroups and individual recipients. However, to demonstrate Entergy Corporation\u2019s strong commitment to its ESG goals, and to more explicitly link compensation to the interests of its stakeholders, the EAM will be determined based on financial and non-financial measures beginning in 2021. Specifically, a financial measure will be weighted 60%, while quantitative and qualitative non-financial measures, including ESG metrics, will account for the remaining 40%.\nFinancial Measure: Keeping with the committee\u2019s goal of aligning performance measures with financial results that link to externally communicated investor guidance, ETR Tax Adjusted earnings per share or ETR Tax Adjusted EPS will continue to be used as the financial measure to determine 60% of the EAM. ETR Tax Adjusted EPS is based on Entergy\u2019s Adjusted Earnings Per Share (\u201cETR Adjusted EPS\u201d), which is the earnings measure that is used for external guidance. ETR Adjusted EPS adjusts Entergy Corporation\u2019s as reported (GAAP) earnings per share results to eliminate the impact of its Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, significant tax items and other non-routine items. To arrive at ETR Tax Adjusted EPS, ETR Adjusted EPS is adjusted to add back the effect of significant tax items, and to eliminate the effect of: (i) major storms, including the impact on total debt of pending securitizations, (ii) the resolution of certain unresolved regulatory litigation matters, (iii) unrealized gains or losses on equity securities, (iv) potential effects of federal income tax law changes, and (v) elective contributions to pension plans or trusts related to non-qualified postretirement benefits that deviate from original plan assumptions.\nNon-Financial Measures: The following non-financial metrics will be used to determine 40% of the EAM for 2021:\nTargets for each of the non-financial measures will be clearly defined and will be designed to drive employee behaviors that support all four of Entergy Corporation\u2019s stakeholders - customers, employees, communities and our owners.\nLong-Term Performance Incentive Program (\u201cLTIP\u201d). In recent performance periods, Entergy Corporation has used two financial measures to determine awards under the LTIP - a cumulative earnings per share (EPS) measure (most recently cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS) and relative total shareholder return (\u201cTSR\u201d). To emphasize the importance of strong cash generation for the long-term health of its business, Entergy Corporation is replacing the EPS measure with a credit measure - adjusted FFO/Debt ratio for the 2021 - 2023 performance period. The adjusted FFO/Debt ratio is the ratio of: (i) adjusted funds from operations calculated as operating cash flow adjusted for allowance for funds used during construction, working capital and the effects of securitization revenue, and the pre-defined exclusions discussed above for the annual incentives; to (ii) total debt, excluding outstanding or pending securitization debt. The Personnel Committee decided to use this ratio because it emphasizes financial stability, noting that a financially healthy utility creates the capacity to make investments on behalf of customers, addresses the needs of communities, provides low-cost access to capital markets and promotes employee confidence. Relative TSR will continue to be used as the other performance measure for the 2021 - 2023 LTIP performance period, with relative TSR weighted 80% and the credit measure weighted 20%. Relative TSR measures Entergy Corporation\u2019s total TSR relative to the TSR of the companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index as of December 31, 2020. Targets for the LTIP performance measures will include the same exclusions that will be used to determine the annual incentive financial measure targets.\n2020 Incentive Payouts\nPerformance measures and targets for the 2020 annual incentive awards were determined by the Personnel Committee in January 2020 and the targets and measures for the 2018 - 2020 LTIP performance cycle were\nestablished in January 2018. In January 2021, the Personnel Committee certified the results for the EAM for the 2020 annual incentive awards and the 2018 - 2020 LTIP performance cycle. The Personnel Committee did not make any adjustments to the targets for either program for the impact of COVID-19 on Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nEntergy Corporation believes the 2020 incentive pay outcomes for the NEOs demonstrate the application of its pay for performance philosophy.\nAnnual Incentive Awards\nThe Personnel Committee determined that the 2020 EAM would be based on two equally weighted performance metrics:\n\u2022ETR Tax Adjusted Earnings Per Share (\u201cETR Tax Adjusted EPS\u201d): Entergy Corporation uses a single non-GAAP earnings measure for guidance and investor reporting purposes that reflects its ongoing business. This measure, Entergy Adjusted Earnings Per Share (\u201cETR Adjusted EPS\u201d) adjusts Entergy Corporation\u2019s as reported (GAAP) earnings per share results to eliminate the impact of its Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, significant tax items and other non-routine items. ETR Tax Adjusted EPS is based on the externally reported ETR Adjusted EPS, which is then adjusted to add back the effect of significant tax items, and to eliminate the effect of major storms, the resolution of certain unresolved regulatory litigation matters, changes in federal income tax law and unrealized gains or losses on equity securities (the \u201cPre-Determined Exclusions\u201d), as well as other items the Personnel Committee may consider appropriate adjustments based on management accountability and business rationale.\n\u2022Entergy Adjusted Operating Cash Flow (\u201cETR Adjusted OCF\u201d): ETR Adjusted OCF is calculated based on Entergy Corporation\u2019s as-reported (GAAP) operating cash flow, adjusted to eliminate the effect of any Pre-Determined Exclusions.\nThe 2020 annual incentive award targets and results determined by the Personnel Committee were:\nAnnual Incentive Program Performance Goals 2020 Targets 2020 Results\nETR Tax Adjusted EPS $5.60 $6.90\nETR Adjusted OCF ($ billions) $3.450 $3.127\nEAM as a percentage of target 100% 120%\nAverage NEO Payout (as a percentage of target) 124%\nIn January 2021, the Personnel Committee determined that ETR Adjusted EPS exceeded the maximum by $1.30, but fell short of achieving its ETR Adjusted OCF target of $3.45 billion by approximately $323 million, leading to a preliminary EAM of 118%. In recognition of management\u2019s success in achieving positive outcomes in 2020 on certain strategic efforts deemed critical to Entergy Corporation\u2019s long-term success, the committee exercised its discretion to increase the EAM by 2% to 120%. Based on each NEO\u2019s individual accountabilities and accomplishments, the committee then determined individual annual incentive awards of 115% to 150% of the target opportunity for each of the NEOs.\nLong-Term Performance Unit Program\nIn January 2018, the Personnel Committee chose relative TSR and Cumulative Adjusted Utility, Plant & Other Earnings Per Share (\u201cCumulative Adjusted UP&O EPS\u201d), each weighted equally, as the performance measures for the 2018 - 2020 LTIP performance period. Cumulative Adjusted UP&O EPS adjusts Entergy Corporation\u2019s cumulative operational Utility, Parent & Other results to eliminate the impact of tax items and weather. Similar to the way targets are established for the annual incentive awards, the relative TSR and Cumulative Adjusted UP&O EPS performance measures were established by the Personnel Committee after the Board\u2019s review of Entergy Corporation\u2019s strategic plan.\nThe targets and results for the 2018 - 2020 LTIP performance period as determined by the Personnel Committee were:\nLTIP Results 2018 - 2020 LTIP Target 2018 - 2020 LTIP Result\nRelative TSR Median 2nd Quartile\nCumulative Adjusted UP&O EPS $15.20 $15.25\nPayout (as a percentage of target) 100% 126%\nWhat Entergy Corporation Pays and Why\nPrincipal Executive Compensation Elements\nThe principal components of Entergy Corporation\u2019s 2020 executive compensation programs and the purpose of each component were:\nCompetitive Positioning\nMarket Data for Compensation Comparison\nAnnually, the Personnel Committee reviews:\n\u2022Published and private compensation survey data compiled by Pay Governance, the Personnel Committee\u2019s independent compensation consultant;\n\u2022Both utility and general industry data to determine total cash compensation (base salary and annual incentive) for non-industry specific roles;\n\u2022Data from utility companies to determine total cash compensation for management roles that are utility-specific, such as Group President, Utility Operations; and\n\u2022Utility market data to determine long-term incentives for all positions.\nHow the Personnel Committee Uses the Market Data\nThe Personnel Committee uses this survey data to develop compensation opportunities that are designed to deliver total direct compensation (\u201cTDC\u201d) within a targeted range of approximately the 50th percentile of the surveyed companies in the aggregate. In most cases, the committee considers its objectives to have been met if Entergy Corporation\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and the eight other executive officers (including the applicable NEOs) who constitute the OCE each has a target compensation opportunity that falls within a targeted range of 85% - 115% of the 50th percentile of the survey data. In general, compensation levels for an executive officer who is new to a position tend to be at the lower end of the competitive range, while seasoned executive officers whose experience and skill set are viewed as critical to retain would be positioned at the higher end of the competitive range. Generally, differences in the levels of TDC among the NEOs are primarily driven by the scope of their responsibilities, differences in the competitive market pay range for similar positions, performance and considerations of internal pay equity.\nProxy Peer Group\nAlthough the survey data described above are the primary data used in benchmarking compensation, the committee uses compensation information from the companies included in the Philadelphia Utility Index to evaluate the overall reasonableness of Entergy Corporation\u2019s compensation programs and to determine relative TSR for the 2020 - 2022 LTIP performance period. The companies included in the Philadelphia Utility Index at the time the Personnel Committee approved the 2020 compensation model and framework were:\n*El Paso Electric Co. is no longer included in the Philadelphia Utility Index.\n2020 Compensation Decisions\nBase Salary\nWhen setting the base salaries of the NEOs who are members of the OCE, the Personnel Committee generally targets the range of compensation paid to similarly situated executive officers of the companies included in the market data previously discussed in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis under \u201cCompetitive Positioning.\u201d For the other NEOs, their salaries are established by their immediate supervisors using the same criteria. The base salaries of the NEOs are considered annually as part of the performance review process, and upon a NEO\u2019s promotion or other change in job responsibilities. Based on this review in 2020 and after reviewing the market data above, all of the NEOs, other than Mr. Denault, received increases in their base salaries ranging from approximately 2.5% to 6.15%. In 2020, Mr. Denault did not receive an increase in his base salary. Instead, the\nPersonnel Committee increased Mr. Denault\u2019s TDC by increasing his long-term incentive target opportunities; thereby, increasing the portion of his compensation that is \u201cat risk\u201d and further aligning his interests with those of Entergy Corporation\u2019s shareholders.\nThe following table sets forth the 2019 and 2020 base salaries for the Named Executive Officers. Changes in base salaries for 2020 were effective in April.\nAnnual Incentive Compensation\nIn 2020, annual incentive awards were tied to Entergy Corporation\u2019s financial and operational performance through the EAM. Entergy Corporation uses the following process to determine annual incentive awards:\n\u2022Establish Performance Measures to Determine EAM Pool. Annually, the Personnel Committee engages in a rigorous process to determine the performance measures used to determine the EAM. The Personnel Committee\u2019s goal is to establish measures that are consistent with Entergy Corporation\u2019s strategy and business objectives for the upcoming year, as reflected in its strategic plan, and are designed to drive results that represent a high level of achievement. These measures are approved based on a comprehensive review of Entergy Corporation\u2019s strategic plan by its full Board of Directors conducted in December of the preceding year and updated in January to reflect key drivers of anticipated changes in performance from the preceding year.\n\u2022Establish Target Achievement Levels. In January, after Entergy Corporation\u2019s strategic plan is updated to reflect any changes from that reviewed in December, the Personnel Committee establishes the specific targets that must be achieved for each performance measure. The Personnel Committee also seeks to assure that the targets:\n\u25e6Take into account changes in the business environment and specific challenges facing Entergy Corporation;\n\u25e6Reflect an appropriate balancing of the various risks and opportunities recognized at the time the targets are set; and\n\u25e6Are aligned with external expectations communicated to Entergy Corporation\u2019s shareholders.\n\u2022Establish NEO Target Opportunities. In January of each year, the Personnel Committee establishes the target opportunities for the members of the OCE based on its review of the competitive analysis of job-specific market data prepared by Pay Governance as well as the officer\u2019s role, individual performance and internal equity considerations. For the NEOs who are members of the OCE (Messrs. Bakken, Brown, Denault, Marsh and West), target award opportunities are established based on these factors. For the other NEOs, target award opportunities are determined based on their management level within the Entergy organization. Executive management levels at Entergy Corporation range from ML level 1 through ML level 4 (the \u201cML 1-4 Officers\u201d). At December 31, 2020, Mr. May held a Level 3 position, and Mr. Ellis,\nMr. Fisackerly, Ms. Landreaux and Ms. Rainer held Level 4 positions. Accordingly, their respective incentive award opportunities differ from one another based on either their management level or the external market data developed by the Committee\u2019s independent compensation consultant. The 2020 target opportunities were increased for Mr. Bakken, Mr. Brown, Mr. Marsh and Mr. West to align more closely with market data and internal pay equity. Mr. Denault\u2019s 2020 target opportunity was unchanged from the level set in 2019 due to the Personnel Committee\u2019s decision to increase his TDC by increasing his long-term incentive target opportunities. The target levels for the other NEOs are comparable to the levels set for 2019.\n\u2022Determine the EAM. In January, after the end of the fiscal year, the Finance and Personnel Committees jointly review Entergy Corporation\u2019s financial results and the Personnel Committee determines the EAM, which represents the level of success in achieving the performance objectives established by the committee and determines the maximum funding level of the annual incentive plan, as a percentage of the total target opportunity.\n\u2022Determine Annual Incentive Awards. To determine individual executive officer awards under the annual incentive plan, the Personnel Committee considers not only each executive\u2019s role in executing on Entergy Corporation\u2019s strategies and delivering the financial performance achieved, but also the individual\u2019s accountability for any challenges Entergy Corporation experienced during the year.\nEstablishing 2020 Financial Measures and Targets\nUsing the process described above, in December 2019, the Personnel Committee decided to use ETR Tax Adjusted EPS and ETR Adjusted OCF, with each measure weighted equally, as the performance measures for determining the 2020 EAM pool. ETR Tax Adjusted EPS is based on ETR Adjusted EPS, which is the primary earnings measure used by Entergy Corporation externally and the measure on which it provides annual earnings guidance. To arrive at ETR Tax Adjusted EPS, ETR Adjusted EPS is adjusted to add back the effect of any significant tax items that were excluded to arrive at ETR Adjusted EPS and to eliminate the effects, if any, of the Pre-Determined Exclusions. ETR Adjusted OCF is calculated based on Entergy Corporation\u2019s as-reported (GAAP) operating cash flow, adjusted to eliminate the effect of any significant non-routine items not representative of the ongoing business, such as items associated with the decisions to sell or close the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, and any Pre-Determined Exclusions. The Personnel Committee determined that ETR Tax Adjusted EPS and ETR Adjusted OCF were the appropriate metrics to use for annual incentives in 2020 because:\n\u2022They are based on objective financial measures that Entergy Corporation and its investors consider to be important in evaluating its financial performance;\n\u2022They are based on the same metrics we use for internal and external financial reporting; and\n\u2022They provide both discipline and transparency.\nThe Personnel Committee considered it appropriate to use ETR Tax Adjusted EPS, which adds back the effect of significant tax items that may have been excluded from ETR Adjusted EPS, as the earnings measure because of the significant financial benefits to Entergy Corporation resulting from such tax items and the management effort required to achieve them. The Personnel Committee also considered the appropriateness of excluding the effect of each of the specific Pre-Determined Exclusions it had identified from each of the financial measures. It viewed the exclusion of major storms as appropriate because although Entergy Corporation includes estimates for storm costs in its financial plan, it does not include estimates for a major storm event, such as a hurricane. The Personnel Committee considered the exclusion of any unanticipated effects of the tax reform legislation adopted at the end of 2017 to be appropriate because of the lingering uncertainty around those effects and the inability of management to impact those results. The Personnel Committee approved the other exclusions from reported results - for the impact of certain legacy unresolved regulatory litigation and unanticipated unrealized gains and losses on securities held by Entergy Corporation\u2019s nuclear decommissioning trusts - primarily because of management\u2019s inability to influence either of the related outcomes. The Personnel Committee further provided that in determining the 2020 EAM, the 2020 results would be subject to adjustment for other items the committee may consider appropriate in its review of 2020 performance, considering management accountability and business\nrationale, and the EAM as so calculated would be subject to further adjustment at the committee\u2019s discretion based on business considerations.\nIn determining the targets to set for 2020, the Personnel Committee reviewed anticipated drivers and risks to Entergy Corporation\u2019s expectations for its adjusted earnings and operating cash flow for 2020 as set forth in its financial plan, as well as factors driving the strong financial performance achieved in 2019. The Personnel Committee confirmed that the proposed plan targets for ETR Tax Adjusted EPS and ETR Adjusted OCF reflected significant growth in the core earnings and consolidated operating cash flow measures underlying the annual incentive plan targets. The Personnel Committee also noted that while the 2020 ETR Tax Adjusted EPS target was less than the 2019 results, the 2020 target represented significant growth in the underlying ETR Adjusted EPS both from 2019 results and from the 2019 target, with the primary driver of the higher results in 2019 being certain one-time tax benefits that would not be recurring in 2020. The Personnel Committee also considered the potential impact of a wide range of identified risks and opportunities and confirmed that the related annual incentive plan targets reflected a reasonable balancing of such risks and opportunities and an appropriate degree of challenge.\n2020 Performance Assessment\nThe following table shows the 2020 annual incentive plan performance metrics and targets established by the Personnel Committee to determine the 2020 EAM and 2020 results:\nAnnual Incentive Plan Targets and Results\n(1)Payouts for performance between achievement levels are calculated using straight-line interpolation, with no payout for performance below the minimum achievement level for both performance measures.\nIn January 2021, the Finance and Personnel Committees jointly reviewed Entergy Corporation\u2019s financial results against the performance objectives reflected in the table above. Management discussed with the committees Entergy Corporation\u2019s ETR Tax Adjusted EPS and the ETR Adjusted OCF results for 2020, including primary factors explaining how those results compared to the 2020 business plan and annual incentive plan targets set in January 2020. ETR Tax Adjusted EPS exceeded the ETR Tax Adjusted EPS target of $5.60 per share by $1.30, but management fell short of achieving its ETR Adjusted OCF target of $3.45 billion by approximately $323 million, leading to a preliminary EAM of 118%. These results reflected a positive adjustment of $0.10 to ETR Tax Adjusted EPS and a positive adjustment of $274 million to ETR Adjusted OCF for the effects on earnings and operational cash flow of major storms impacting Entergy Corporation\u2019s service area during 2020, consistent with the Pre-Determined Exclusions approved when the targets were set at the beginning of the year. The results also reflected a positive adjustment of $100 million to ETR Adjusted OCF for the effect on operational cash flow of additional voluntary contributions made to Entergy Corporation\u2019s pension plan in 2020 over and above the required level of contributions, which adjustment was made because the committee did not consider it appropriate for management to be penalized in the incentive compensation process for choosing to make such elective contributions, consistent with the Pre-Determined Exclusion for items the committee determined should be excluded based on management accountability and business rationale.\nThe Personnel Committee considered whether 2020 ETR Tax Adjusted EPS or ETR Adjusted OCF should be adjusted for any other factors that had impacted 2020 results. The committee noted that 2020 revenues and cash flow had been adversely impacted by reduced sales resulting from unfavorable weather, the COVID-19 pandemic and, to a lesser extent, major storms, which collectively reduced ETR Adjusted EPS by approximately $0.71 per share, and ETR Adjusted OCF by approximately $663 million as compared to plan. In addition, the Personnel Committee noted that ETR Adjusted OCF had been further reduced by approximately $178 million due to increased customer arrearages as a result of regulatory moratoria on customer disconnects following the onset of the pandemic. As noted, both ETR Tax Adjusted EPS and ETR Adjusted OCF were adjusted to reflect the impact of\nmajor storms as a Pre-Determined Exclusion. However, the committee decided not to adjust the results to reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the disconnect moratoria or the unfavorable weather experienced in 2020.\nIn addition to the foregoing financial results, the Personnel Committee considered management\u2019s degree of success in achieving various operational and regulatory goals set out at the beginning of the year and in overcoming certain challenges that arose in the business during the course of the year. The committee took note of not only the many ways management had created value for all Entergy Corporation\u2019s key stakeholders during 2020, but also the major challenges that were overcome in the process, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges of responding to three hurricanes in a record-breaking storm season for the Gulf Coast. The committee also noted that despite these challenges, management had remained focused on achieving strong financial results for the benefit of all of its stakeholders while at the same time driving positive outcomes in certain areas that would contribute to Entergy Corporation\u2019s long term sustainability, including particularly the achievement of its 2020 CO2 emissions goal, development and announcement of its goal to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and significant enhancements to its sustainability disclosure and reporting, and substantial progress in other important ESG and sustainability efforts. In recognition of these accomplishments, which the committee considers to be critical to Entergy Corporation\u2019s long-term success, the committee exercised its discretion to increase the EAM by 2% to 120%.\nTo determine individual NEO annual incentive awards for the NEOs who are member of the OCE, the Personnel Committee considered individual performance in executing on Entergy Corporation\u2019s strategies and delivering the strong financial performance achieved in 2020. In addition, the Personnel Committee considered the individual\u2019s key accountabilities and accomplishments in relation to certain operational and regulatory challenges Entergy Corporation experienced during the year. With these considerations in mind, the Personnel Committee approved payouts ranging from 115% to 120% of target for each of the NEOs who are members of the OCE.\nAfter the EAM was established to determine overall funding for the annual incentive awards, Entergy Corporation\u2019s Chief Executive Officer allocated incentive award funding to individual business units based on business unit results. Individual awards were determined for the remaining NEOs who are not members of the OCE by their immediate supervisor based on the individual officer\u2019s key accountabilities, accomplishments, and performance. This resulted in payouts that ranged from 117% of target to 150% of target for the NEOs who are not members of the OCE.\nBased on the foregoing evaluation of management performance, the Named Executive Officers received the following annual incentive payouts for 2020:\nLong-Term Incentive Compensation\nOverview\nLong-term incentive compensation, consisting solely of equity awards in 2020, represents the largest portion of executive officer compensation, and as noted earlier, the increase in Mr. Denault\u2019s TDC opportunity was delivered in the form of long-term incentive compensation. Entergy Corporation believes the combination of long-term incentives it employs provides a compelling performance-based compensation opportunity, acts in retaining the senior management team, and aligns the interests of Entergy Corporation\u2019s executive officers with the interests of its shareholders and customers by enhancing executives focus on Entergy Corporation\u2019s long-term goals. In general, Entergy Corporation seeks to allocate the total value of long-term incentive compensation 60% to performance units and 40% to a combination of stock options and restricted stock, equally divided in value, based on the value the compensation model seeks to deliver.\nFor each NEO who is a member of the OCE, a dollar value is established to determine that NEO\u2019s long-term incentive awards target. The targeted award value for each NEO is determined based on market median compensation data for the officer\u2019s role, adjusted to reflect individual performance and internal equity. In January 2020, the Personnel Committee approved the 2020 long-term incentive award target amounts for each NEO with each NEO\u2019s target amount increasing in recognition of the contributions made to Entergy Corporation in 2019. This target amount was then converted into the number of performance units, stock options and shares of restricted stock granted to each NEO based on the allocation described above.\nIn consultation with Entergy Corporation\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, the Personnel Committee reviews each of the other NEO\u2019s performance, role and responsibilities, strengths, developmental opportunities and internal equity and allocates awards of restricted stock and stock options to each of these officers based on these factors. Grants of long-term performance units for these NEOs were determined based on the average of the market data for the officers within a specific management level, without regard to the officer\u2019s specific job function, and allocated as described above.\n2020 Long-Term Incentive Award Mix\nLong-Term Performance Unit Program\nThe NEOs are issued performance unit awards under the LTIP.\n\u2022Each performance unit represents one share of Entergy Corporation\u2019s common stock at the end of the three-year performance period, plus dividends accrued during the performance period.\n\u2022The performance units and accrued dividends on any shares earned during the performance period are settled in shares of Entergy Corporation common stock.\n\u2022The Personnel Committee sets payout opportunities for the program at the outset of each performance period.\n\u2022No payout under this program will be made if relative TSR for the performance period falls within the lowest quartile of the peer companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index and Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS is below the minimum performance goal.\n\u2022All shares paid out under the LTIP are required to be retained by Entergy Corporation\u2019s officers until applicable executive stock ownership requirements are met.\nThe LTIP specifies a minimum, target and maximum achievement level, the achievement of which will determine the number of performance units that may be earned by each participant. For the 2020 - 2022 LTIP performance period, the Personnel Committee chose the performance measures and targets set forth below.\n2020-2022 LTIP Unit Program Period: Measures and Goals(1)\n(1)Payouts for performance between achievement levels are calculated using straight-line interpolation, with no payouts for performance below the minimum achievement level for both performance measures.\nPerformance Measures\nRelative TSR\n\u2022The Personnel Committee chose relative TSR as a performance measure because it reflects Entergy Corporation\u2019s creation of shareholder value relative to other electric utilities included in the Philadelphia Utility Index over the performance period. By measuring performance in relation to an industry benchmark, this measure is intended to isolate and reward management for the creation of shareholder value that is not driven by events that affect the industry as a whole.\n\u2022Minimum, target and maximum performance levels are determined by reference to the ranking of Entergy Corporation\u2019s TSR in relation to the TSR of the companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index. The Personnel Committee identified the Philadelphia Utility Index as the appropriate industry peer group for determining relative TSR because the companies included in this index, in the aggregate, are deemed to be comparable to Entergy Corporation in terms of business and scale.\nCumulative ETR Adjusted EPS\n\u2022Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS, which adjusts Entergy Corporation\u2019s as reported (GAAP) results to eliminate the impact of earnings or loss from Entergy Wholesale Commodities and other non-routine items, was selected in 2020 as a performance measure because the Personnel Committee wished to incentivize management to achieve steady, predictable earnings growth for Entergy Corporation over the 3 year performance period, and because it aligns with the earnings measure used to communicate Entergy Corporation\u2019s earnings expectations externally to investors.\n\u2022In a manner similar to the way targets are established for the annual incentives, targets for the Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS performance measure were established by the Personnel Committee after the Entergy Corporation Board\u2019s review of Entergy\u2019s strategic plan for the three-year period beginning in 2020 and are consistent with the earnings expectations for Entergy Corporation that are communicated to investors. These targets also incorporate the Pre-Determined Exclusions discussed previously with respect to the annual incentive measures.\nStock Options and Restricted Stock\nEntergy Corporation grants stock options and shares of restricted stock because they align the interests of the executive officers with long-term shareholder value, provide competitive compensation, and increase the executives\u2019 ownership in Entergy Corporation common stock. Generally, stock options are granted with a maximum term of ten years, and vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. The exercise price for each option granted in 2020 was $131.72, which was the closing price of Entergy Corporation\u2019s common stock on the date of grant. Shares of restricted stock vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries\nof the date of grant, are paid dividends which are reinvested in shares of Entergy Corporation common stock and have full voting rights. The dividend reinvestment shares are subject to forfeiture similar to the terms of the original grant.\n2020 Long-Term Incentive Awards\nIn January 2020, the Personnel Committee granted the following long-term performance units, stock options and shares of restricted stock to each NEO. The number of long-term performance units, stock options and shares of restricted stock were determined as discussed above under \u201cLong-Term Incentive Compensation - Overview.\u201d\nAll of the performance units, shares of restricted stock and stock options granted to the NEOs in 2020 were granted pursuant to the 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan or 2019 OIP. The 2019 OIP requires both a change in control and an involuntary job loss without cause or a resignation by the NEO for good reason within 24 months following a change in control (a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d) for the acceleration of these awards upon a change in control.\n2020 LTIP Payouts\nPayout for the 2018 - 2020 LTIP Performance Period. In January 2018, the Personnel Committee chose relative TSR and Cumulative Adjusted UP&O EPS as the performance measures, each weighted equally, for the 2018 - 2020 LTIP performance period. Cumulative Adjusted UP&O EPS, which adjusted Entergy Corporation\u2019s operational Utility, Parent & Other results to eliminate the impact of tax items and weather (the \u201cUP&O Adjustments\u201d), was added as a performance measure because it aligned with Entergy Corporation\u2019s externally communicated earnings measure on its core utility business and was the primary measure on which Entergy Corporation communicated its long term earnings outlooks in 2018. Similar to the way targets are established for the annual incentive program, targets for the Cumulative Adjusted UP&O EPS performance measure were established by the Personnel Committee after the Entergy Corporation Board\u2019s review of Entergy Corporation\u2019s strategic plan. These targets also exclude the Pre-Determined Exclusions discussed previously with respect to the annual incentive measures, as well as the UP&O Adjustments. The payout was determined based on the achievement of the following performance goals established for both performance measures by the committee at the beginning of the performance period:\n2018-2020 LTIP Performance Period Measures and Goals\n(1)Payouts for performance between achievement levels are calculated using straight-line interpolation, with no payouts for performance below the minimum achievement level.\nIn January 2021, the Personnel Committee reviewed Entergy Corporation\u2019s TSR and the Cumulative Adjusted UP&O EPS for the 2018 - 2020 LTIP performance period in order to determine the payout to participants based upon the performance measures and range of potential payouts for the 2018 - 2020 LTIP performance period as provided above. The committee compared Entergy Corporation\u2019s TSR against the TSR of the companies that were included in the Philadelphia Utility Index throughout the three year performance period, which were:\nAs recommended by the Finance Committee, the Personnel Committee concluded that Entergy Corporation\u2019s relative TSR for the 2018 - 2020 performance period was in the second quartile, and that Cumulative Adjusted UP&O EPS was $15.25, yielding a payout of 126% of target for the NEOs.\n(1)Includes accrued dividends.\n(2)Value determined based on the closing price of Entergy Corporation common stock on January 19, 2021 ($95.12), the date the Personnel Committee certified the 2018-2020 performance period results.\n(3)Represents the aggregate grant date fair value calculated in accordance with applicable accounting rules as reflected in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.\n(4)As a new hire in 2018, Mr. Ellis received a pro-rata target award opportunity for the 2018 - 2020 performance period.\n(5)As a new officer in 2018, Ms. Landreaux received a pro-rata target award opportunity for the 2018 - 2020 performance period.\nBenefits and Perquisites\nEntergy Corporation\u2019s NEOs are eligible to participate in or receive the following benefits:\nPlan Type Description\nRetirement Plans Entergy Corporation-sponsored:\nEntergy Retirement Plan - a tax-qualified final average pay defined benefit pension plan that covers a broad group of employees hired before July 1, 2014.\nCash Balance Plan - a tax-qualified cash balance defined benefit pension plan that covers a broad group of employees hired on or after July 1, 2014 and before January 1, 2021.\nPension Equalization Plan - a non-qualified pension restoration plan for a select group of management or highly compensated employees who participate in the Entergy Retirement Plan.\nCash Balance Equalization Plan - a non-qualified restoration plan for a select group of management or highly compensated employees who participate in the Cash Balance Plan.\nSystem Executive Retirement Plan - a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for individuals who became executive officers before July 1, 2014.\nSavings Plan Entergy Corporation-sponsored 401(k) Savings Plan that covers a broad group of employees.\nHealth & Welfare Benefits Medical, dental and vision coverage, health care and dependent care reimbursement plans, life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, business travel accident insurance, and long-term disability insurance.\nEligibility, coverage levels, potential employee contributions, and other plan design features are the same for the NEOs as for the broad employee population.\n2020 Perquisites Corporate aircraft usage and annual mandatory physical exams. The NEOs who are members of the OCE do not receive tax gross ups on any benefits, except for relocation assistance.\nIn 2020, the NEOs who are not members of the OCE also were provided in 2020 with club dues and tax gross up payments on this perquisite.\nFor additional information regarding perquisites, see the \u201cAll Other Compensation\u201d column in the 2020 Summary Compensation Table.\nDeferred Compensation The NEOs are eligible to defer up to 100% of their base salary and annual incentive awards into the Entergy Corporation sponsored Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.\nExecutive Disability Plan Eligible individuals who become disabled under the terms of the plan are eligible for 65% of the difference between their annual base salary and $276,923 (i.e. the annual base salary that produces the maximum $15,000 monthly disability payment under the general long-term disability plan).\nEntergy Corporation provides these benefits to the NEOs as part of its effort to provide a competitive executive compensation program and because it believes that these benefits are important retention and recruitment tools since many of the companies with which it competes for executive talent provide similar arrangements to their senior executive officers.\nSeverance and Retention Arrangements\nThe Personnel Committee believes that retention and transitional compensation arrangements are an important part of overall compensation as they help to secure the continued employment and dedication of the NEOs, notwithstanding any concern that they might have at the time of a change in control regarding their own continued employment. In addition, the Personnel Committee believes that these arrangements are important as recruitment and retention devices, as many of the companies with which Entergy Corporation competes for executive talent have similar arrangements in place for their senior employees.\nTo achieve these objectives, Entergy Corporation has established a System Executive Continuity Plan under which ML 1-4 Officers are entitled to receive \u201cchange in control\u201d payments and benefits if such officer\u2019s employment is involuntarily terminated without cause or if the officer resigns for good reason, in each case, in connection with a change in control of Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation strives to ensure that the benefits and payment levels under the System Executive Continuity Plan are consistent with market practices. Entergy Corporation\u2019s executive officers, including the NEOs, are not entitled to any tax gross up payments on any severance benefits received under this plan. For more information regarding the System Executive Continuity Plan, see \u201c2020 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control.\u201d\nNuclear Retention Plan\nMr. Bakken participates in the Nuclear Retention Plan, a retention plan for officers and other leaders with expertise in the nuclear industry. The Personnel Committee authorized this plan to attract and retain key management and employee talent in the nuclear power field, a field that requires unique technical and other expertise that is in great demand in the utility industry. The plan provides for bonuses to be paid annually over a three-year service period with the bonus opportunity dependent on the participant\u2019s management level and continued employment. Each annual payment is equal to an amount ranging from 15% to 30% of the employee\u2019s base salary as of their date of enrollment in the plan.\nIn recognition of the value Entergy Corporation places on Mr. Bakken as a member of its senior management team and his extensive experience in the nuclear industry, and to keep his pay competitive, in May 2019, Mr. Bakken\u2019s participation in the plan was renewed for another three-year period beginning on May 1, 2019. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Nuclear Retention Plan, in May 2020 Mr. Bakken received, and in May 2021 and 2022, Mr. Bakken will receive a cash bonus equal to 30% of $654,078, his base salary as of May 1, 2019. The three-year period covered and percentage of base salary paid to Mr. Bakken under the plan are consistent with the terms of participation of other senior executive officers who participate in this plan.\nRisk Mitigation and Other Pay Practices\nEntergy Corporation strives to ensure that its compensation philosophy and practices are in line with the best practices of companies in its industry as well as other companies in the S&P 500. Some of these practices include the following:\nClawback Provisions\nEntergy Corporation has adopted a clawback policy that covers all individuals subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, including all of the NEOs. Under the policy, which goes beyond the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley), incentives paid to covered executive officers are required to be reimbursed where:\n\u2022(i) the payment was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial results with respect to the applicable performance period that were subsequently determined to be the subject of a material restatement other than a restatement due to changes in accounting policy; or (ii) a material miscalculation of a performance award occurs, whether or not the financial statements were restated and, in either such case, a lower payment would have been made to the executive officer based upon the restated financial results or correct calculation; or\n\u2022in the Board of Directors\u2019 view, the executive officer engaged in fraud that caused or partially caused the need for a restatement or caused a material miscalculation of a performance award, in each case, whether or not the financial statements were restated.\nThe amount required to be reimbursed is equal to the excess of the gross incentive payment made over the gross payment that would have been made if the original payment had been determined based on the restated financial results or correct calculation. In addition, Entergy Corporation will seek to recover any compensation received by its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that is required to be reimbursed under Sarbanes-Oxley following a material restatement of Entergy Corporation\u2019s financial statements.\nStock Ownership Guidelines and Share Retention Requirements\nFor many years, Entergy Corporation has had stock ownership guidelines for executives, including the NEOs. These guidelines are designed to align the executives\u2019 long-term financial interests with the interests of Entergy Corporation\u2019s shareholders. Annually, the Personnel Committee monitors the executive officers\u2019 compliance with these guidelines with all of the NEOs satisfying the applicable ownership guidelines at that time. The ownership guidelines are as follows:\nThe ownership guidelines are as follows:\nFurther, to facilitate compliance with the guidelines, until an executive officer satisfies the stock ownership guidelines, the officer must retain:\n\u2022all net after-tax shares paid out under the LTIP;\n\u2022all net after-tax shares of the restricted stock and restricted stock units received upon vesting; and\n\u2022at least 75% of the after-tax net shares received upon the exercise of Entergy Corporation stock options.\nTrading Controls\nExecutive officers, including the NEOs, are required to receive permission from Entergy Corporation\u2019s General Counsel or his designee prior to entering into any transaction involving Entergy Corporation securities, including gifts, other than the exercise of employee stock options. Trading is generally permitted only during specified open trading windows beginning shortly after the release of earnings. Employees, who are subject to trading restrictions, including the NEOs, may enter into trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, but these trading plans may be entered into only during an open trading window and must be approved by Entergy Corporation. A NEO bears full responsibility if he or she violates Entergy Corporation\u2019s policy by buying or selling shares of Entergy Corporation stock without pre-approval or when trading is restricted.\nEntergy Corporation also prohibits directors and executive officers, including the NEOs, from pledging any Entergy Corporation securities or entering into margin accounts involving Entergy Corporation securities. Entergy Corporation prohibits these transactions because of the potential that sales of Entergy Corporation securities could occur outside trading periods and without the required approval of the General Counsel.\nEntergy Corporation also has adopted an anti-hedging policy that prohibits officers, directors, and employees from entering into hedging or monetization transactions involving Entergy Corporation\u2019s common stock. Prohibited transactions include, without limitation, zero-cost collars, forward sale contracts, purchase or sale of options, puts, calls, straddles or equity swaps or other derivatives that are directly linked to Entergy Corporation\u2019s stock or transactions involving \u201cshort-sales\u201d of its common stock.\nCompensation Consultant Independence\nAnnually, the Personnel Committee reviews the relationship with its compensation consultant to determine whether any conflicts of interest exist that would prevent Pay Governance from independently advising the Personnel Committee. Factors considered by the committee when assessing the independence of its compensation consultant included, among others:\n\u2022Pay Governance has policies in place to prevent conflicts of interest;\n\u2022No member of Pay Governance\u2019s consulting team serving the committee has a business relationship with any member of the committee or any of Entergy Corporation\u2019s executive officers;\n\u2022Neither Pay Governance nor any of its principals own any shares of Entergy Corporation\u2019s common stock; and\n\u2022The amount of fees paid to Pay Governance is less than 1% of Pay Governance\u2019s total consulting income.\nBased on these factors, the Personnel Committee concluded that Pay Governance is independent in accordance with SEC and NYSE rules and that no conflicts of interest exist that would prevent Pay Governance from independently advising the committee.\nIn addition, Pay Governance has agreed that it will not accept any engagement with management without prior approval from the Personnel Committee, and Entergy Corporation\u2019s Board has adopted a policy that prohibits a compensation consultant from providing other services to it if the aggregate amount for those services would exceed $120,000 in any year. During 2020, Pay Governance did not provide any services to Entergy Corporation other than the services it performed on behalf of the Personnel and Corporate Governance Committees, and it worked with Entergy Corporation\u2019s management only as directed by the committees.\nPERSONNEL COMMITTEE REPORT\nThe Personnel Committee Report included in the Entergy Corporation Proxy Statement is incorporated by reference, but will not be deemed to be \u201cfiled\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. None of the Registrant Subsidiaries has a compensation committee or other board committee performing equivalent functions. The board of directors of each of the Registrant Subsidiaries is comprised of individuals who are officers or employees of Entergy Corporation or one of the Registrant Subsidiaries. These boards do not make determinations regarding the compensation paid to executive officers of the Registrant Subsidiaries.\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES\n2020 Summary Compensation Tables\nThe following table summarizes the total compensation paid or earned by each of the NEOs for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, and to the extent required by SEC executive compensation disclosure rules, the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. For information on the principal positions held by each of the NEOs, see Item 10, \u201cDirectors, Executive Officers, and Corporate Governance of the Registrants.\u201d\nThe compensation set forth in the table represents the aggregate compensation paid by all Entergy System companies. For additional information regarding the material terms of the awards reported in the following tables, including a general description of the formula or criteria to be applied in determining the amounts payable, see \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis.\u201d\n(1)Mr. Ellis was named Chief Executive Officer, Entergy New Orleans in December 2018, and Ms. Landreaux was named Chief Executive Officer, Entergy Arkansas in July 2018.\n(2)The amounts in column (c) represent the actual base salary paid to the NEOs in the applicable year. The 2020 base salary amounts include an amount attributable to an extra pay period that occurred in 2020 as the NEOs are paid on a bi-weekly basis. The 2020 changes in base salaries noted in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis were effective in April 2020.\n(3)The amount in column (d) in 2020, 2019, and 2018 for Mr. Bakken represents the cash bonus paid to him pursuant to the Nuclear Retention Plan. See \u201cNuclear Retention Plan\u201d in Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The amount in column (d) in 2018 for Mr. Ellis represents a cash sign-on bonus paid in connection with his commencement of employment with Entergy New Orleans.\n(4)The amounts in column (e) represent the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock and performance units granted under the 2015 Equity Ownership Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries (the \u201c2015 EOP\u201d) and the 2019 OIP (together with the 2015 EOP, the \u201cEquity Plans\u201d), each calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, without taking into account estimated forfeitures. The grant date fair value of the restricted stock is based on the closing price of Entergy Corporation common stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value of the portion of the performance units with vesting based on the total shareholder return was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model. The simulation model applies a risk-free interest rate and an expected volatility assumption. The risk-free interest rate is assumed to equal the yield on a three-year treasury bond on the grant date. Volatility is based on historical volatility for the 36-month period preceding the grant date. The performance units in the table are also valued based on the probable outcome of the applicable performance condition at the time of grant. The maximum value of shares that would be received if the highest achievement level is attained with respect to both the total shareholder return and Cumulative ETR Adjusted EPS, for performance units granted in 2020 are as follows: Mr. Bakken,\n$2,043,768; Mr. Brown, $1,994,504; Mr. Denault, $8,235,925; Mr. Ellis, $250,268; Mr. Fisackerly, $250,268; Ms. Landreaux $250,268; Mr. Marsh, $2,518,486; Mr. May, $368,816; Ms. Rainer, $250,268; and Mr. West, $2,213,159.\n(5)The amounts in column (f) represent the aggregate grant date fair value of stock options granted under the Equity Plans calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. For a discussion of the relevant assumptions used in valuing these awards, see Note 12 to the financial statements.\n(6)The amounts in column (g) represent annual incentive award cash payments made under the 2019 OIP.\n(7)For all NEOs, the amounts in column (h) include the annual actuarial increase in the present value of these NEOs\u2019 benefits under all pension plans established by Entergy Corporation using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in Entergy Corporation\u2019s financial statements and include amounts which the NEOs may not currently be entitled to receive because such amounts are not vested (see \u201c2020 Pension Benefits\u201d). The increase in pension benefits for all of the NEOs in 2020 was driven by a decline in the discount rate that was a result of the decrease in prevailing interest rates. None of the increases for any of the NEOs is attributable to above-market or preferential earnings on non-qualified deferred compensation. For 2018, the aggregate change in the actuarial present value was a decrease of pension benefits of $52,000 for Mr. Fisackerly, $163,000 for Mr. Marsh, $700 for Mr. May, $110,700 for Ms. Rainer, and $149,300 for Mr. West.\n(8)The amounts in column (i) for 2020 include (a) matching contributions by Entergy Corporation under the Savings Plan to each of the NEOs; (b) dividends paid on restricted stock when vested; (c) life insurance premiums; (d) tax gross up payments on club dues; and (e) perquisites and other compensation as described further below. The amounts are listed in the following table:\n(9)In order to show the effect that the year-over-year change in pension value had on total compensation, as determined under applicable SEC rules, we have included an additional column to show total compensation minus the change in pension value. The amounts reported in the Total Without Change in Pension Value column may differ substantially from the amounts reported in the Total column required under SEC rules and are not a substitute for total compensation. Total Without Change in Pension Value represents total compensation, as determined under applicable SEC rules, minus the change in pension value reported in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column. The change in pension value is subject to many external variables, such as interest rates, assumptions about life expectancy and changes in the discount rate determined at each year end, which are functions of economic factors and actuarial calculations that are not related to Entergy Corporation\u2019s performance and are outside of the control of the Personnel Committee.\nPerquisites and Other Compensation\nThe amounts set forth in column (i) also include perquisites and other personal benefits that Entergy Corporation provides to its NEOs as part of providing a competitive executive compensation program and for employee retention. The following perquisites were provided to the NEOs in 2020.\nFor security and business reasons, Entergy Corporation\u2019s Chief Executive Officer is permitted to use its corporate aircraft for personal use at the expense of Entergy Corporation. The other NEOs may use the corporate aircraft for personal travel subject to the approval of Entergy Corporation\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. The Personnel Committee reviews the level of usage throughout the year. Entergy Corporation believes that its officers\u2019 ability to use its plane for limited personal use saves time and provides additional security for them, thereby benefiting Entergy Corporation. The amounts included in column (i) for the personal use of corporate aircraft, reflect the incremental cost to Entergy Corporation for use of the corporate aircraft, determined on the basis of the variable operational costs of each flight, including fuel, maintenance, flight crew travel expense, catering, communications, and fees, including flight planning, ground handling, and landing permits. The aggregate incremental aircraft usage cost associated with Mr. Denault\u2019s personal use of the corporate aircraft was $86,618 for fiscal year 2020. In addition, Entergy Corporation offers its executives comprehensive annual physical exams at Entergy Corporation\u2019s expense. None of the other perquisites referenced above exceeded $25,000 for any of the other NEOs.\n2020 Grants of Plan-Based Awards\nThe following table summarizes award grants during 2020 to the NEOs.\n(1)The amounts in columns (c), (d), and (e) represent minimum, target, and maximum payment levels under the annual incentive program. The actual amounts awarded are reported in column (g) of the Summary Compensation Table.\n(2)The amounts in columns (f), (g), and (h) represent the minimum, target, and maximum payment levels under the LTIP. Performance under the program is measured by Entergy Corporation\u2019s total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder returns of the companies included in the Philadelphia Utility Index and Cumulative Entergy Adjusted EPS with total shareholder return weighted eighty percent and Cumulative Entergy Adjusted EPS weighted twenty percent. There is no payout under the program if Entergy Corporation\u2019s total shareholder return falls within the lowest quartile of the peer companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index and Cumulative Entergy Adjusted EPS is below the minimum performance goal. Subject to the achievement of performance targets, each unit will be converted into one share of Entergy Corporation\u2019s common stock on the last day of the performance period (December 31, 2022). Accrued dividends on the shares earned will also be paid in Entergy Corporation common stock.\n(3)The amounts in column (i) represent shares of restricted stock granted under the 2019 OIP. Shares of restricted stock vest one-third on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date, have voting rights, and accrue dividends during the vesting period.\n(4)The amounts in column (j) represent options to purchase shares of Entergy Corporation\u2019s common stock. The options vest one-third on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date and have a ten-year term from the date of grant. The options were granted under the 2019 OIP.\n(5)The amounts in column (l) are valued based on the aggregate grant date fair value of the award calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 and, in the case of the performance units, are based on the probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions. See Notes 4 and 5 to the 2020 Summary Compensation Table for a discussion of the relevant assumptions used in calculating the grant date fair value.\n2020 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End\nThe following table summarizes, for each NEO, unexercised options, restricted stock that has not vested, and equity incentive plan awards outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\n(1)Consists of options granted under the 2019 OIP; 1/3 of the options vested on January 30, 2021 and 1/3 of the remaining options will vest on each of January 30, 2022 and January 30, 2023.\n(2)Consists of options granted under the 2015 EOP; 1/2 of the options vested on January 31, 2021 and the remaining options will vest on January 30, 2022.\n(3)Consists of options granted under the 2015 EOP that vested on January 25, 2021.\n(4)Consists of performance units granted under the 2019 OIP that will vest on December 31, 2022 based on two performance measures: 1) Entergy Corporation\u2019s total shareholder return performance over the 2020-2022 performance period and 2) Cumulative Entergy Adjusted EPS with total shareholder return weighted eighty percent and Cumulative Entergy Adjusted EPS weighted twenty percent, as described under \u201cWhat Entergy Corporation Pays and Why - Long-Term Incentive Compensation - 2020 Long-Term Incentive Award Mix - Long-Term Performance Unit Program\u201d in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis.\n(5)Consists of performance units granted under the 2015 EOP that will vest on December 31, 2021 based on two performance measures: 1) Entergy Corporation\u2019s total shareholder return performance over the 2019-2021 performance period and 2) Cumulative Entergy Adjusted EPS with total shareholder return weighted eighty percent and Cumulative Entergy Adjusted EPS weighted twenty percent.\n(6)Consists of shares of restricted stock granted under the 2019 OIP; 1/3 of the shares of restricted stock vested on January 30, 2021 and 1/3 of the remaining shares will vest on each of January 30, 2022 and January 30, 2023.\n(7)Consists of shares of restricted stock granted under the 2015 EOP; 1/2 of the shares of restricted stock vested on January 31, 2021 and the remaining shares of restricted stock will vest on January 31, 2022.\n(8)Consists of shares of restricted stock granted under the 2015 EOP that vested on January 25, 2021.\n(9)Consists of restricted stock units granted under the 2015 EOP which will vest 1/2 on each of April 6, 2022 and April 6, 2025.\n2020 Option Exercises and Stock Vested\nThe following table provides information concerning each exercise of stock options and each vesting of stock during 2020 for the NEOs.\n(1)Represents the value of performance units for the 2018 - 2020 performance period (payable solely in shares based on the closing stock price of Entergy Corporation on the date of vesting) under the LTIP and the vesting of shares of restricted stock in 2020.\n2020 Pension Benefits\nThe following table shows the present value as of December 31, 2020, of accumulated benefits payable to each of the NEOs, including the number of years of service credited to each NEO, under the retirement plans sponsored by Entergy Corporation, determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions set forth in Note 11 to the financial statements. Additional information regarding these retirement plans follows this table.\n(1)As of December 31, 2020, Mr. Brown, Mr. Denault, Mr. Fisackerly, Mr. May, and Ms. Rainer were retirement eligible.\n(2)In 2006, Mr. Denault entered into a retention agreement granting him additional years of service and permission to retire under the non-qualified System Executive Retirement Plan (\u201cSERP\u201d) in the event his employment is terminated by his Entergy employer other than for cause (as defined in the retention agreement), by Mr. Denault for good reason (as defined in the retention agreement), or on account of his death or disability. His retention agreement also provides that if he terminates employment for any other reason, he shall be entitled to up to an additional 15 years of service under the SERP only if his Entergy employer grants him permission to retire subject to the overall 30 year cap on service credit under the SERP. The amount reflected in the table for the SERP is calculated based on 30 years of service. The additional years of service credited to Mr. Denault under his retention agreement increased the present value of Mr. Denault\u2019s benefit by $4,020,200.\n(3)Service under the SERP is granted from the date of hire. Service under the qualified Entergy Retirement Plan is granted from the later of the date of hire or the plan participation date. The SERP amounts reflected in the table for Mr. May and Ms. Rainer are calculated based on 30 years of service pursuant to the terms of the SERP.\nRetirement Benefits\nThe tables below contain summaries of the pension benefit plans sponsored by Entergy Corporation that the NEOs participated in during 2020. Benefits for the NEOs who participate in these plans are determined using the same formulas as for other eligible employees.\nQualified Retirement Benefits\nBenefit Timing Normal retirement age under the plan is 65.\nA reduced terminated vested benefit may be commenced as early as age 55. The amount of this benefit is determined by reducing the normal retirement benefit by 7% per year for the first 5 years commencement precedes age 65, and 6% per year for each additional year commencement precedes age 65.\nA subsidized early retirement benefit may be commenced by employees who are at least age 55 with 10 years of service at the time they separate from service. The amount of this benefit is determined by reducing the normal retirement benefit by 2% per year for each year that early retirement precedes age 65. Normal retirement age under the plan is 65.\nA vested cash balance benefit can be commenced as early as the first day of the month following separation from service. The amount of the benefit is determined in the same manner as the normal retirement benefit described above in the \u201cRetirement Benefit Formula\u201d section.\nNon-qualified Retirement Benefits\nThe NEOs are eligible to participate in certain non-qualified retirement benefit plans that provide retirement income, including the Pension Equalization Plan (\u201cPEP\u201d), the Cash Balance Equalization Plan, and the SERP. Each of these plans is an unfunded non-qualified defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits to key management employees. In these plans, as described below, an executive may participate in one or more non-qualified plans, but is only paid the amount due under the plan that provides the highest benefit. In general, upon disability, participants in the PEP and the SERP remain eligible for continued service credits until the earlier of recovery, separation from service due to disability, or retirement eligibility. Generally, spouses of participants who die before commencement of benefits may be eligible for a portion of the participant\u2019s accrued benefit.\nAdditional Information\n(1)Effective July 1, 2014, (a) no new grants of supplemental service may be provided to participants in the Pension Equalization Plan; (b) supplemental credited service granted prior to July 1, 2014 was grandfathered; and (c) participants in Entergy Corporation\u2019s Cash Balance Plan are not eligible to participate in the Pension Equalization Plan and instead may be eligible to participate in the Cash Balance Equalization Plan.\n(2)Benefits accrued under the SERP, PEP, and Cash Balance Equalization Plan, if any, will become fully vested if a participant is involuntarily terminated without cause or terminates his or her employment for good reason in connection with a change in control with payment generally made in a lump-sum payment as soon as reasonably practicable following the first day of the month after the termination of employment, unless delayed 6 months under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.\n(3)The SERP was closed to new executive officers effective July 1, 2014.\n2020 Non-qualified Deferred Compensation\nAs of December 31, 2020, Mr. May had a deferred account balance under a frozen Defined Contribution Restoration Plan. The amount is deemed invested, as chosen by Mr. May, in certain T. Rowe Price investment funds that are also available to the participant under the Savings Plan. Mr. May has elected to receive the deferred account balance after he retires. The Defined Contribution Restoration Plan, until it was frozen in 2005, credited eligible employees\u2019 deferral accounts with employer contributions to the extent contributions under the qualified savings plan in which the employee participated were subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.\nDefined Contribution Restoration Plan\n(1)Amounts in this column are not included in the Summary Compensation Table.\n2020 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control\nEntergy Corporation has plans and other arrangements that provide compensation to a NEO if his or her employment terminates under specified conditions, including following a change in control of Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries.\nChange in Control\nUnder Entergy Corporation\u2019s System Executive Continuity Plan (the \u201cContinuity Plan\u201d), ML 1-4 Officers are eligible to receive the severance benefits described below if their employment is terminated by their Entergy System employer other than for cause or if they terminate their employment for good reason during a period beginning with a potential change in control and ending 24 months following the effective date of a change in control (a \u201cQualifying Termination\u201d). A participant will not be eligible for benefits under the Continuity Plan if such participant: accepts employment with Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; elects to receive the benefits of another severance or separation program; removes, copies or fails to return any property belonging to Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or violates his or her non-compete provision (which generally runs for two years but extends to three years if permissible under applicable law). Entergy Corporation does not have any plans or agreements that provide for payments or benefits to any of the NEOs solely upon a change in control.\nIn the event of a Qualifying Termination, executive officers, including the NEOs, generally will receive the benefits set forth below:\n* Cash severance payments are capped at 2.99 times the sum of (a) an executive\u2019s annual base salary plus (b) the higher of his or her actual annual incentive payment under the annual incentive program or his or her annual incentive, calculated using the average annual target opportunity derived under the annual incentive program for the two calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which termination occurs. Any cash severance payments to be paid under the Continuity Plan in excess of this cap will be forfeited by the participant.\nTo protect shareholders and Entergy Corporation\u2019s business model, executives are required to comply with non-compete, non-solicitation, confidentiality and non-denigration provisions. If an executive discloses non-public data or information concerning Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or violates his or her non-compete provision, he or she will be required to repay any benefits previously received under the Continuity Plan.\nFor purposes of the Continuity Plan the following events are generally defined as:\n\u2022Change in Control: (a) the purchase of 30% or more of either Entergy Corporation\u2019s common stock or the combined voting power of Entergy Corporation\u2019s voting securities; (b) the merger or consolidation of Entergy Corporation (unless its Board members constitute at least a majority of the board members of the surviving entity); (c) the liquidation, dissolution or sale of all or substantially all of Entergy Corporation\u2019s assets; or (d) a change in the composition of Entergy Corporation\u2019s Board such that, during any two-year period, the individuals serving at the beginning of the period no longer constitute a majority of Entergy Corporation\u2019s Board at the end of the period.\n\u2022Potential Change in Control: (a) Entergy Corporation or an affiliate enters into an agreement the consummation of which would constitute a Change in Control; (b) the Entergy Corporation Board adopts resolutions determining that, for purposes of the Continuity Plan, a potential Change in Control has occurred; (c) a System Company or other person or entity publicly announces an intention to take actions that would constitute a Change in Control; or (d) any person or entity becomes the beneficial owner (directly or indirectly)\nof Entergy Corporation\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock constituting 20% or more of the voting power or value of the Entergy Corporation\u2019s outstanding common stock.\n\u2022Cause: The participant\u2019s (a) willful and continuous failure to perform substantially his or her duties after written demand for performance; (b) engagement in conduct that is materially injurious to Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; (c) conviction or guilty or nolo contendere plea to a felony or other crime that materially and adversely affects either his or her ability to perform his or her duties or Entergy Corporation\u2019s reputation; (d) material violation of any agreement with Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; or (e) disclosure of any of Entergy Corporation\u2019s confidential information without authorization.\n\u2022Good Reason: The participant\u2019s (a) nature or status of duties and responsibilities is substantially altered or reduced; (b) salary is reduced by 5% or more; (c) primary work location is relocated outside the continental United States; (d) compensation plans are discontinued without an equitable replacement; (e) benefits or number of vacation days are substantially reduced; or (f) employment is terminated by an Entergy employer for reasons other than in accordance with the Continuity Plan.\nOther Termination Events\nFor termination events, other than in connection with a Change in Control, the executive officers, including the NEOs, generally will receive the benefits set forth below:\n* If an officer resigns after the completion of an annual incentive plan, he or she may receive, at Entergy Corporation\u2019s discretion, an annual incentive payment.\n** If an officer resigns after the completion of a LTIP performance period, he or she may receive a payout under the LTIP based on the outcome of the performance period.\nMr. Denault\u2019s 2006 Retention Agreement\nIn 2006, Entergy Corporation entered into a retention agreement with Mr. Denault that provides benefits to him in addition to, or in lieu of, the benefits described above. Specifically, in the event of a Termination Event (as defined in his agreement): 1) Mr. Denault is entitled to a Target LTIP Award calculated by using the average annual number of performance units with respect to the two most recent performance periods preceding the calendar year in which his employment termination occurs, assuming all performance goals were achieved at target; and 2) all of Mr. Denault\u2019s unvested stock options and shares of restricted stock will immediately vest.\nIn the event of death or disability, Mr. Denault would receive the greater of the Target LTIP Award calculated as described above or the pro-rated number of performance units for all open performance periods, based on the number of months of his participation in each open performance period.\nUnder the terms of his 2006 retention agreement, Mr. Denault\u2019s employment may be terminated for cause upon Mr. Denault\u2019s: (a) continuing failure to substantially perform his duties (other than because of physical or mental illness or after he has given notice of termination for good reason) that remains uncured for 30 days after receiving a written notice from the Personnel Committee; (b) willfully engaging in conduct that is demonstrably and materially injurious to Entergy; (c) conviction of or entrance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or other crime that has or may have a material adverse effect on his ability to carry out his duties or upon Entergy\u2019s reputation; (d) material violation of any agreement that he has entered into with Entergy; or (e) unauthorized disclosure of Entergy\u2019s confidential information.\nMr. Denault may terminate his employment for good reason upon: (a) the substantial reduction in the nature or status of his duties or responsibilities from those in effect immediately prior to the date of the retention agreement, other than de minimis acts that are remedied after notice from Mr. Denault; (b) a reduction of 5% or more in his base salary as in effect on the date of the retention agreement; (c) the relocation of his principal place of employment to a location other than the corporate headquarters; (d) the failure to continue to allow him to participate in programs or plans providing opportunities for equity awards, incentive compensation and other plans on a basis not materially less favorable than enjoyed at the time of the retention agreement (other than changes similarly affecting all senior executives); (e) the failure to continue to allow him to participate in programs or plans with opportunities for benefits not materially less favorable than those enjoyed by him under any of the pension, savings, life insurance, medical, health and accident, disability or vacation plans or policies at the time of the retention agreement (other than changes similarly affecting all senior executives); or (f) any purported termination of his employment not taken in accordance with his retention agreement.\nAggregate Termination Payments\nThe tables below reflect the amount of compensation each of the NEOs would have received if his or her employment had been terminated as of December 31, 2020 under the various scenarios described above. For purposes of these tables, a stock price of $99.84 was used, which was the closing market price of Entergy Corporation stock on December 31, 2020, the last trading day of the year.\n1)See \u201c2020 Pension Benefits\u201d for a description of the pension benefits Mr. Bakken, Mr. Ellis, Ms. Landreaux, Mr. Marsh, and Mr. West may receive upon the occurrence of certain termination events.\n2)As of December 31, 2020, Mr. Brown, Mr. Denault, Mr. Fisackerly, Mr. May, and Ms. Rainer are retirement eligible and would retire rather than voluntarily resign, and in addition to the payments and benefits in the table, Mr. Brown, Mr. Denault, Mr. Fisackerly, Mr. May, and Ms. Rainer also would be entitled to receive their vested pension benefits under the Entergy Retirement Plan. For a description of these benefits, see \u201c2020 Pension Benefits.\u201d\n3)For purposes of the table, in the event of a qualifying termination related to a change in control, each NEO would receive a payment in respect of his performance units for the 2019 - 2021 performance period and a number of performance units for the 2020 - 2022 performance period, calculated as follows.\nFor the 2019 - 2021 performance period, each NEO would be entitled to receive a single-lump sum payment calculated using the target number of performance units that the officer would have been entitled to receive under the 2015 EOP with respect to the most recent performance period that precedes and does not include the officer\u2019s date of termination. The value of Mr. Denault\u2019s payments was calculated by multiplying the target performance units for the 2017 - 2019 LTIP performance period (48,700) by the closing price of Entergy Corporation stock on December 31, 2020 ($99.84), which would equal a payment of $4,862,208 for the forfeited performance units for the 2019 - 2021 performance period. The value of Mr. Bakken\u2019s, Mr. Brown\u2019s,\nMr. Marsh\u2019s, and Mr. West\u2019s was calculated by multiplying the target performance units for the 2017 - 2019 LTIP performance period (8,300) by the closing price of Entergy Corporation stock on December 31, 2020 ($99.84), which would equal a payment of $828,672 for the forfeited performance units for the 2019 - 2021 performance period. The value of Mr. May\u2019s payment was calculated by multiplying the target performance units for the 2017 - 2019 LTIP performance period (3,150) by the closing price of Entergy Corporation stock on December 31, 2020 ($99.84), which would equal a payment of $314,496 for the forfeited performance units for the 2019 - 2021 performance period. The value of the payments for the other NEOs was calculated by multiplying the target performance units for the 2017 - 2019 LTIP performance period (1,850) by the closing price of Entergy Corporation stock on December 31, 2020 ($99.84), which would equal a payment of $184,704 for the forfeited performance units for the 2019 - 2021 performance period.\nFor the 2020 - 2022 performance period, in the event of a qualifying termination related to a change in control, each NEO would be entitled to receive a number of shares of Entergy Corporation stock equal to the greater of (1) the target number of performance units subject to the 2020 - 2022 performance unit agreement or (2) the number of performance units that would vest under the 2020 - 2022 performance unit agreement calculated based on Entergy Corporation\u2019s actual performance through the NEO\u2019s termination date, in either case pro-rated based on the portion of the performance period that occurs through the termination date. For purposes of the table, the values of the performance unit awards for the 2020 - 2022 performance period for each NEO were calculated as follows, based on the assumption that the target number of performance units was the greater number:\nMr. Bakken: 2,586 (12/36*7,758) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $258,186\nMr. Brown: 2,524 (12/36*7,571) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $251,996\nMr. Denault: 10,421 (12/36*31,263) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $1,040,433\nMr. Ellis: 317 (12/36*950) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $31,649\nMr. Fisackerly: 317 (12/36*950) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $31,649\nMs. Landreaux: 317 (12/36*950) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $31,649\nMr. May: 467 (12/36*1,400) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $46,625\nMr. Marsh: 3,187 (12/36*9,560) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $318,190\nMs. Rainer: 317 (12/36*950) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $31,649\nMr. West: 2,801 (12/36*8,401) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $279,652\nThe total values of the single sum payment for the 2019 - 2021 performance period and the performance units award for the 2020 - 2022 performance period upon a change in control for each NEO is as follows:\nMr. Bakken: $828,672 + $258,186 = $1,086,858\nMr. Brown: $828,672 + $251,996 = $1,080,668\nMr. Denault: $4,862,208 + $1,040,433 = $5,902,641\nMr. Ellis: $184,704 + $31,649 = $216,353\nMr. Fisackerly: $184,704 + $31,649 = $216,353\nMs. Landreaux: $184,704 + $31,649 = $216,353\nMr. May: $314,496 + $46,625 = $361,121\nMr. Marsh: $828,672 + $318,190 = $1,146,862\nMs. Rainer: $184,704 + $31,649 = $216,353\nMr. West: $828,672 + $279,652 = $1,108,324\nFor purposes of the table, the values of the awards payable in the event of retirement in the case of Mr. Denault, Mr. Brown, Mr. Fisackerly, Mr. May, or Ms. Rainer or upon death or disability, other than Mr. Denault, for each NEO were calculated as follows:\nMr. Bakken\u2019s:\n2019 - 2021 LTIP Performance Period: 6,379 (24/36*9,568) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $636,879\n2020 - 2022 LTIP Performance Period: 2,586 (12/36*7,758) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $258,186\nTotal: $895,065\nMr. Brown\u2019s:\n2019 - 2021 LTIP Performance Period: 6,256 (24/36*9,383) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $$624,599\n2020 - 2022 LTIP Performance Period: 2,524 (12/36*7,571) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $251,996\nTotal: $876,595\nMr. Denault\u2019s:\n2019 - 2021 LTIP Performance Period: 27,006 (24/36*40,508) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $2,696,279\n2020 - 2022 LTIP Performance Period: 10,421 (12/36*31,263) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $1,040,433\nTotal: $3,736,712\nMr. Marsh\u2019s:\n2019 - 2021 LTIP Performance Period: 7,913 (24/36*11,869) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $790,034\n2020 - 2022 LTIP Performance Period: 3,187 (12/36*9,560) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $318,190\nTotal: $1,108,224\nMr. May\u2019s:\n2019 - 2021 LTIP Performance Period: 1,434 (24/36*2,150) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $143,171\n2020 - 2022 LTIP Performance Period: 467 (12/36*1,400) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $46,625\nTotal: $189,796\nMr. Ellis\u2019s, Mr. Fisackerly\u2019s, Ms. Landreaux\u2019s and Ms. Rainer\u2019s:\n2019 - 2021 LTIP Performance Period: 967 (24/36*1,450) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $96,545\n2020 - 2022 LTIP Performance Period: 317 (12/36*950) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $31,649\nTotal: $128,194\nMr. West\u2019s:\n2019 - 2021 LTIP Performance Period: 6,716 (24/36*10,073) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $670,525\n2020 - 2022 LTIP Performance Period: 2,801 (12/36*8,401) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $99.84 = $279,652\nTotal: $950,177\n4)For purposes of the table, the value of Mr. Denault\u2019s retention payment was calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the 2016 - 2018 LTIP (41,700) and from the 2017 - 2019 LTIP (48,700). This average number of units (45,200) multiplied by the closing price of Entergy stock on December 31, 2020 ($99.84) would equal a payment of $4,512,768.\n5)Pursuant to the SERP, in the event of a termination related to a change in control, Mr. Bakken, Mr. Marsh, and Mr. West would be eligible to receive Entergy-subsidized COBRA benefits for 18 months and Mr. Ellis and Ms. Landreaux would be eligible to receive Entergy-subsidized COBRA benefits for 12 months.\n6)Upon retirement, Mr. Brown, Mr. Denault, Mr. Fisackerly, Mr. May, and Ms. Rainer would be eligible for retiree medical and dental benefits, the same as all other retirees.\n7)Mr. Bakken\u2019s 20,000 restricted stock units vest in two equal installments on April 6, 2022 and April 6, 2025. In the event of a change in control, the unvested restricted stock units will fully vest upon Mr. Bakken\u2019s Qualifying Termination during a change in control period. Pursuant to his restricted stock unit agreement, Mr. Bakken is subject to certain restrictions on his ability to compete with Entergy and its affiliates or solicit its employees or customers during and for 12 months after his employment with his Entergy employer. In addition, the restricted stock unit agreement limits Mr. Bakken\u2019s ability to disparage Entergy and its affiliates. In the event of a breach of these restrictions, other than following certain constructive terminations of his employment, Mr. Bakken will forfeit any restricted stock units that are not yet vested and paid, and must repay to Entergy any shares of Entergy stock paid to him in respect of the restricted stock units and any amounts he received upon the sale or transfer of any such shares.\nPay Ratio\nAs required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the following disclosure is being provided about the relationship of the annual total compensation of the employees of each of the Utility operating companies to the annual total compensation of their respective Presidents and Chief Executive Officers. The pay ratio estimate for each of the Utility operating companies has been calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.\nIdentification of Median Employee\nFor each of the Utility operating companies, October 2, 2020 was selected as the date on which to determine the median employee. This date is different from the date used in the prior year; however, the methodology used to determine the date is consistent with that used in the prior year. Both dates correspond to the first day of the three month period prior to fiscal year-end for which information can be obtained about employees and all subsidiaries have the same number of pay cycles. To identify the median employee from each of the Utility operating companies\u2019 employee population base, all compensation included in Box 5 of Form W-2 was considered with all before-tax deductions added back to this compensation (\u201cBox 5 Compensation\u201d). For purposes of determining the median employee of each Utility operating company, Box 5 Compensation was selected as it is believed to be representative of the compensation received by the employees of each respective Utility operating company and is readily available.\nThe calculation of annual total compensation of the median employee for each Utility operating company is the same calculation used to determine total compensation for purposes of the 2020 Summary Compensation Table with respect to each of the NEOs.\nEntergy Arkansas Ratio\nFor 2020,\n\u2022The median of the annual total compensation of all of Entergy Arkansas\u2019s employees, other than Ms. Landreaux, was $135,370.\n\u2022Ms. Landreaux\u2019s annual total compensation, as reported in the Total column of the 2020 Summary Compensation Table was $1,150,511.\n\u2022Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mrs. Landreaux to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is estimated to be 8:1.\nEntergy Louisiana Ratio\nFor 2020,\n\u2022The median of the annual total compensation of all of Entergy Louisiana\u2019s employees, other than Mr. May, was $131,155.\n\u2022Mr. May\u2019s annual total compensation, as reported in the Total column of the 2020 Summary Compensation Table, was $2,257,961.\n\u2022Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. May to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is estimated to be 17:1.\nEntergy Mississippi Ratio\nFor 2020,\n\u2022The median of the annual total compensation of all of Entergy Mississippi\u2019s employees, other than Mr. Fisackerly, was $111,238.\n\u2022Mr. Fisackerly\u2019s annual total compensation, as reported in the Total column of the 2020 Summary Compensation Table, was $1,803,939.\n\u2022Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Fisackerly to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is estimated to be 16:1.\nEntergy New Orleans Ratio\nFor 2020,\n\u2022The median of the annual total compensation of all of Entergy New Orleans\u2019s employees, other than Mr. Ellis, was $150,102.\n\u2022Mr. Ellis\u2019s annual total compensation, as reported in the Total column of the 2020 Summary Compensation Table was $804,810.\n\u2022Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Ellis to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is estimated to be 5:1.\nEntergy Texas Ratio\nFor 2020,\n\u2022The median of the annual total compensation of all of Entergy Texas\u2019s employees, other than Ms. Rainer, was $160,680.\n\u2022Ms. Rainer\u2019s annual total compensation, as reported in the Total column of the 2020 Summary Compensation Table, was $1,543,383.\n\u2022Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Ms. Rainer to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is estimated to be 10:1.",
