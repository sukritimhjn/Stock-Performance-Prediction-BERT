    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nSUMMARY\nApplied Minerals, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cApplied Minerals\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) (OTCQB: AMNL) owns the Dragon Mine in central Utah. From the mine we extract, process, or have processed by a third party, halloysite clay and iron oxide for sale to a range of end markets. We market the minerals directly and through distributors and also under a profit-sharing agreement with the Kaolin business unit of BASF Corp. (\u201cBASF\u201d).\nWe also engage in research and development and frequently work collaboratively with potential customers, consultants, distributors, and a third party processor (BASF) to process and enhance our halloysite clay products to improve the performance of our customers\u2019 existing and new products.\nHalloysite\nOur halloysite clay, which we market under the DRAGONITE\u2122 trade name, is an aluminosilicate mineral with a hollow tubular shape. DRAGONITE can utilize halloysite\u2019s shape, high surface area, and reactivity to add significant functionality to a number of applications.\nIron Oxide\nOur iron oxide, which we market under the AMIRON\u2122 trade name, is a high purity product. We have sold it as an absorbent for hydrogen sulfide gas contained in natural gas.\nSales\nIn 2019, we recorded revenues of $486,046, of which $418,587 was related to sales of DRAGONITE to 20 customers and $67,459 was related to sales of AMIRON to 2 customers.\nCharacterization of the Mineralization\nOver the last ten years, the Company has expended significant resources, including commissioning a resource study, to determine the amount, character and mineability of the mineralization of the deposits at the Dragon Mine.\nClassification for SEC Purposes\nThe Company is classified as an \u201cexploration stage\u201d company for purposes of Industry Guide 7 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) Under Industry Guide 7, companies engaged in significant mining operations are classified into three categories, referred to as \u201cstages\u201d - exploration, development, and production. Exploration stage includes all companies that do not have established reserves in accordance with Industry Guide 7. Such companies are deemed to be \u201cin the search for mineral deposits.\u201d Notwithstanding the nature and extent of development-type or production-type activities that have been undertaken or completed, a company cannot be classified as a development or production stage company unless it has established reserves in accordance with Industry Guide 7. The mineralization indicated by the resource study (described below) we have commissioned cannot be classified as a reserve for purpose of Industry Guide 7.\nIn 2018, SEC adopted rules to modernize property disclosures for mining companies. Such rules go into effect in 2021. The mineralization indicated by the resource study would not qualify as a reserve under the new rules.\nProcessing Capability\nIn October 2017 we entered into a Purchase and Supply Agreement with BASF under which BASF, among other things, agreed to provide the Company with up to 15,000 tons of water-based processing capacity. During the fourth calendar quarter of 2019, BASF informed us of its intention to terminate its obligations under the Purchase and Supply Agreement. Per the terms of the termination of the agreement, BASF is obligated to provide the Company with water-based processing capacity into the first calendar quarter of 2021. The Company is currently seeking to obtain water-based processing capacity on a tolling basis to replace the capacity currently provided by BASF.\nWe have a primary processing plant with capacity to mill up to 45,000 tons of mineralization per annum for certain clay applications. This facility can also be used to mill iron oxide. Aditionally, the Company has a second processing facility with a capacity of up to 10,000 tons per annum that is dedicated to processing its halloysite resource. Both facilities utilize dry-based milling equipment that do not eliminate impurities such as iron oxide as effectively as wet processing but are useful in situations where wet processing in not necessary\nDistribution Channels\nThe Company markets and sells its products directly and through distributors. The Company also uses several leading distribution organizations, E.T. Horn, Brandt Technologies, LLC, and Azelis to market its products. The Company has a non-exclusive distribution agreement with a distributor for Taiwan and an exclusive agreement with a distributor for Japan.\nIn October, 2017, we entered into a Purchase and Supply Agreement with the Kaolin business unit of BASF (\u201cSupply Agreement\u201d). The Supply Agreement provided BASF an exclusive license (a) to sell halloysite on a worldwide basis for use within the following third party markets: (i) paints and coatings; (ii) inks; (iii) rubbers (excludes flame retardant and wire and cable applications); (iv) adhesives; (v) paper, and (vi) ceramic honeycomb catalytic substrates and (b) to sell halloysite to other business units of BASF. During the fourth calendar quarter of 2019, BASF informed us of its intention to terminate its obligations under the Purchase and Supply Agreement.\nINFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY\nApplied Minerals, Inc. (OTCQB: AMNL) owns the Dragon Mine from which we can extract halloysite clay and iron oxide, which we then process or have processed and sell. We also engage in research and development and frequently work collaboratively with potential customers, consultants, distributors, and BASF to engineer and enhance our halloysite clay and iron oxide products to improve the performance of our customers\u2019 existing and new products.\nThe Dragon Mine is a 267-acre property located in central Utah, approximately 70 miles south of Salt Lake City, Utah.\nWe market our halloysite clay-based line of products under the tradename DRAGONITE. We have marketed our iron oxide line of products under the tradename AMIRON.\nHalloysite is mined and marketed by other companies, primarily by a French company, Imerys, which owns the other major halloysite mine, which is located in New Zealand. The halloysite from that mine is sold primarily for use in ceramics and tableware. When new management came into the Company in 2009, new management decided to focus on new, premium-priced uses of halloysite. Those premium-priced uses had been, and continue to be, identified typically in published research. Because the Company is primarily dedicated to new, advanced uses of halloysite that would permit the Company to charge premium prices, the sales and marketing process is one that often takes an extended period of time. The Company\u2019s pricing strategy is opportunistic and if significant competition develops, that strategy could be adversely affected.\nThe Company acquired the Dragon Mine primarily to exploit the mine\u2019s halloysite resources. At the time that the Dragon Mine was acquired, it was assumed that the iron oxide mineralization would be useful only for steelmaking. Given historical price conditions and our method of mining (underground), sales of iron oxide for steelmaking would often not be economic and at best would yield marginal or low profits. The iron oxide resource at the Dragon Mine has a high content of Fe2O3, The iron oxide is of high chemical purity, possesses high surface area, fine grains, dispersability, good tinting strength, enhanced color saturation, low color variation, and a low level of heavy metals content, high surface area (25 m2/g - 125 m2/g and reactivity.\nINFORMATION ABOUT THE DRAGON MINE\nHistory of the Dragon Mine\nThe Dragon Mine was first mined in the third quarter of the 19th century and has since been mined by various owners and operators. It was mined for iron oxide from the late nineteenth century until approximately 1931 and it was mined for halloysite clay from approximately 1931 to 1976. From 1949 to 1976, the halloysite was sold for use as a petroleum cracking catalyst. A fire closed the mine in 1976. No mining took place from 1976 until 2001, at which point the Company leased the property with an option to buy it. The Company purchased the property in 2005.\nPrior to a change in management in 2009, the Company did relatively little to categorize the mineralization at the Dragon Mine or to identify and exploit markets for the minerals. Since new management was installed in 2009, the Company has used and proposes to continue to use a consulting geologist to categorize the mineralization at the Dragon Mine and management has identified, developed and exploited premium-priced markets for halloysite and, with respect to the single $5 million sale noted above, iron oxide.\nResource Development/Exploration Drilling Expenses\nIn 2019 and 2018 the Company spent $196,351 and $195,685, respectively, on exploration and resource development.\nMore Detailed Description of the Mineralization at the Dragon Mine\nClays. Kaolinite and halloysite are clays and members of the kaolin group of clays. Both are aluminosilicate clays. Kaolinite and halloysite are essentially chemically identical but have different morphologies (shapes). Kaolinite typically appears in plates or sheets. Halloysite, in contrast, typically appears in the shape of hollow tubes. On average, the halloysite tubes have a length in the range of 0.5 - 3.0 microns, an exterior diameter in the range of 50 - 70 nanometers and an internal diameter (lumen) in the range of 15 - 30 nanometers. Formation of halloysite occurs when kaolinite sheets roll into tubes due to the strain caused by a lattice mismatch between the adjacent silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide layers. Halloysite is non-toxic and natural, demonstrating high biocompatibility without posing any risk to the environment.\nKaolinite is one of the world\u2019s most common minerals. U.S. production in 2016 was approximately 7.3 million tons.\nHalloysite is, by comparison, a rarer mineral and we believe worldwide production is less than 25,000 tons, the majority of which is used in ceramic applications.\nIron Oxide. Hematite is the mineral form of iron oxide, which exists in a range of colors, including black to steel or silver-gray and brown to reddish brown, or red.\nGeothite is an iron hydroxide oxide mineral, which exists in a range of colors, including yellowish to reddish to dark brown. If goethite is sufficiently heated to eliminate its contained water, it is transformed into hematite.\nMixtures of goethite and hematite are the color brown.\nSTATUS OF THE COMPANY FOR SEC REPORTING PURPOSES\nThe Company is classified as an \u201cexploration stage\u201d company for purposes of Industry Guide 7 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nUnder Industry Guide 7, companies engaged in significant mining operations are classified into three categories, referred to as \u201cstages\u201d - exploration, development, and production.\nExploration stage includes all companies engaged in the search for mineral deposits (that is, reserves), which are not in either the development or production stage. In order to be classified as a development or production stage company, the company must have already established reserves. Notwithstanding the nature and extent of development-type or production-type activities that have been undertaken or completed, a company cannot be classified as a development or production stage company unless it has established reserves.\nUnder Industry Guide 7, a \u201creserve\u201d is \u201cthat part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.\u201d Generally speaking, a company may not declare reserves, unless, among other requirements, a competent professional engineer conducts a detailed engineering and economic study and prepares a \u201cbankable\u201d or \u201cfinal\u201d feasibility study that \u201cdemonstrates that a mineral deposit can be mined profitably at a commercial rate.\u201d\nThe Company has commissioned an ongoing study described above that was conducted using the standards of the JORC Code of the Australasian Code for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. The mineralization described in the study does not qualify as reserves for purposes of Industry Guide 7\nIn 2018, SEC adopted rules to modernize property disclosures for mining companies. Such rules go into effect in 2021. The mineralization indicated by the resource study would not qualify as a reserve under the new rules.\nDespite the fact that the Company has not established reserves for purposes of Industry Guide 7, the Company has mined, processed and sold, and intends to continue to mine, process, and sell halloysite clay and iron oxide from the Dragon Mine.\nA consequence of the absence of reserves under Industry Guide 7 is that the mining company, such as the Company, is deemed to lack an objective basis to assert that it has a deposit with mineralization that can be economically and legally extracted or produced and sold to produce revenue.\nPROCESSING CAPABILITIES\nIn October 2017 we entered into a Purchase and Supply Agreement with BASF under which BASF, among other things, agreed to provide the Company with up to 15,000 tons of water-based processing capacity. During the fourth calendar quarter of 2019, BASF informed us of its intention to terminate its obligations under the Purchase and Supply Agreement. Per the terms of the termination of the agreement, BASF is obligated to provide the Company with water-based processing capacity into the first calendar quarter of 2021. The Company is currently seeking to obtain water-based processing capacity on a tolling basis to replace the capacity currently provided by BASF.\nWe have a primary processing plant with capacity to mill up to 45,000 tons of mineralization per annum for certain clay applications. This facility can also be used to mill iron oxide. Aditionally, the Company has a second processing facility with a capacity of up to 10,000 tons per annum that is dedicated to processing its halloysite resource. Both facilities utilize dry-based milling equipment that do not eliminate impurities such as iron oxide as effectively as wet processing but are useful in situations where wet processing in not necessary20w\nMINING AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITY IN 2019 AND 2018\nThe following table discloses for the twelve (12) months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively (i) the number of tons of halloysite clay and iron oxide extracted by the Company from the Dragon Mine and (ii) the number of tons of finished product produced by the Company:\nCUSTOMERS\nDRAGONITE\nDuring 2019 the Company sold its DRAGONITE halloysite clay product to approximately 20 customers. The Company is currently working with a number of prospective customers for its DRAGONITE halloysite clay product and hopes to convert one or more of these prospective customers during 2020. However, the Company cannot provide any assurances that it will be successful in doing so.\nAMIRON\nDuring October 2019 the Company announced it had signed an agreement to supply a manufacture of cement up to 30,000 tons of AMIRON per year over a two-year period. The Company expects to sell the majority of its iron production to this customer during 2020.\nSales by Customer Use\nThe table below discloses the percentage of total revenue by product category for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. \u201cTesting\u201d represents revenue generated from the sale of products used for laboratory testing by customers or potential customers. \u201cScale-Ups\u201d represents revenue generated from the sale of products to customers or potential customers to determine whether our products perform successfully within a production-scale environment. \u201cCommercial Production\u201d represents revenue generated from the sale of products to customers that are either consumed by the costumer or incorporated into a product that is sold by a customer to a third-party. \u201cOther\u201d represents revenue generated from the sale of products for which the Company is not aware of the use by a potential customer.\n* < 1%\nSALES AND MARKETING\nThe Company markets and sells its products directly and/or through distributors.\nE.T. Horn acts as exclusive distributor for AMIRON in the following states: Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico. It acts as exclusive distributor of DRAGONITE in those states plus Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana.\nBrandt Technologies, LLC acts as exclusive distributor for DRAGONITE and AMIRON in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and Michigan.\nAzelis, by itself and through its subsidiaries, Ribelin Sales, Inc., E.W. Kaufman Co., and GMZ Inc., cement acts as exclusive distributor for DRAGONITE in Mississippi. Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine. The Company intends to engage a distributor for AMIRON in these states.\nThe Company has an exclusive agreement with a distributor for Japan.\nIn October, 2017, we entered into an supply agreement with the Kaolin business unit of BASF Corp. (\u201cSupply Agreement\u201d). The Supply Agreement provides that the Company will sell halloysite to BASF and BASF may process and/or treat and will have an exclusive license to sell halloysite on a worldwide basis for use within the following third party markets: (i) paints and coatings; (ii) inks; (iii) rubbers (excludes flame retardant and wire and cable applications); (iv) adhesives; (v) paper, and (vi) ceramic honeycomb catalytic substrates and (b) use by other business units of BASF provided that such BASF business unit only uses or sells the halloysite as part of a product another product. Under the terms of the Supply Agreement, each party is reimbursed from the proceeds of sale for its direct costs and the Company and the BASF Kaolin business unit equally share the profits of any sales of halloysite by the Kaolin business unit. The Supply Agreement has an initial term of three years and automatically renews unless one party terminates.\nDuring the fourth calendar quarter of 2019, BASF terminated its right to market DRAGONITE under the Agreement. At the date of termination of the Agreement, no sales of halloysite had been made by the Kaolin business unit.\nAPPLICATION MARKETS\nDRAGONITE\nThe following is a description of the application markets in which the Company has commercial customers for halloysite-based DRAGONITE products:\nMolecular Sieves and Catalysts.\nMolecular Sieves. DRAGONITE\u2122 is a binder to zeolite crystals to enhance a molecular sieve\u2019s productivity in critical functions such as drying of natural gas and air, separation of liquid from product streams, and separation of impurities from a gas stream. DRAGONITE possesses a dispersion ability that allows it to combine with the zeolite crystals without reducing the rate of diffusion of liquids and gases. DRAGONITE\u2019s fine particle size, porosity, and thermal stability also ensure that adsorbates diffuse rapidly through the sieve without affecting the adsorbent blend\u2019s physical properties.\nCatalysts. DRAGONITE can be used as a catalyst and catalyst support for the hydrotreatment and hydrodemetalation of hydrocarbonaceous feedstocks. DRAGONITE can be used to remove impurities such as metals, sulfur, nitrogen, and asphaltenes. Crude oil petroleum must be processed in order to make it into gasoline and other fuels.. Catalytic cracking involves the addition of a catalyst to speed up the cracking. The reactive nature of halloysite lends itself to being a catalyst especially for high sulfur oil. Halloysite can also be used as a support for catalysts, which are applied to the halloysite as a coating.\nHalloysite from the Dragon Mine was mined and processed as a catalyst for petroleum cracking from 1949 to 1976.\nFlame Retardant Additives\nFlame retardant additives are widely used in flammable and flame resistant plastics and are found in electronics, building insulation, polyurethane foam, and wire and cable.\nPlastic manufacturers typically mix or load a small amount of flame retardant into plastic to lower the risk of flammability of their products. We believe that DRAGONITE can be used as a partial replacement for Alumina Trihydrate (ATH) and Magnesium Hydroxide (MDH) in certain applications and as a synergist to ATH and MDH in other applications.\nAt typical loadings, ATH and MDH can adversely affect certain mechanical properties of plastics. We believe that DRAGONITE, in conjunction with ATH and MDH, exhibits a synergistic performance. Our research and development indicates that DRAGONITE can be used to replace 50% - 75% of antimony trioxide (ATO) in plastic without affecting flame retardancy, retaining the same rating under UL 94, the Standard for Safety of Flammability of Plastic Materials for Parts in Devices and Appliances testing.\nWe believe that in certain applications the use of DRAGONITE instead of other fire retardant products may allow a manufacturer to use less fire retardant and may, in addition, may enable the manufacturer to reduce the weight of the manufactured part. DRAGONITE-XR does not release its naturally bound water until 400\u00b0C, making it suitable for polymers processed under extreme conditions.\nOther clays compete in the markets for partially replacing ATH, MDH, and ATO.\nBinders for Ceramics\nDRAGONITE is an effective binder for traditional ceramic products (any of various hard, brittle, heat-resistant and corrosion-resistant materials made by shaping and then firing a nonmetallic mineral, such as clay, at a high temperature). Binders are substances that improve the mechanical strength of green ceramic bodies so they can pass through production steps before firing without breakage. We believe that DRAGONITE, when used as a binder, also effectuates an improvement in the casting rate of the ceramic manufacturing process. This would equate to an increase in manufacturing efficiency.\nNucleation of Polymers; Reinforcement of Polymers.\nNucleation. Plastics and polymers are composed of long molecular chains that form irregular, entangled coils in a melted resin, the phase in which a resin is liquid and its molecules can move about freely. In semi-crystalline polymers, the chains rearrange upon freezing and form partly ordered regions. Examples of semi-crystalline polymers are polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), Nylon 6 and Nylon 6-6. Crystallization of a polymer occurs as a result of nucleation, a process that starts with small, nanometer-sized domains upon which the polymer chains arrange in an orderly manner to develop larger crystals. The overall rate of crystallization of a polymer be can increased by a nucleating agent. In plastic molding processes, especially in injection molding, the plastic part must remain in the mold until crystallization is complete (freezing). To the extent that crystallization is accelerated, the time in the mold can be reduced, thereby resulting in productivity enhancement. We believe that DRAGONITE added to a resin at a loading of just 1% can significantly speed up the process of crystallization.\nWe believe DRAGONITE can be effective as a nucleating agent for both polyethylene and polypropylene.\nReinforcement Fillers. Many plastics are reinforced with a filler to enhance the mechanical properties of a polymer. Reinforced plastics, in certain instances, can compete with stiffer materials like metal while also offering an opportunity to reduce the weight of a manufactured part (\u201clight-weighting\u201d).\nWe believe that the utilization of DRAGONITE as a reinforcing filler can result in the improvement of one or more mechanical properties of a polymer such as modulus (the measure of how well a polymer resists breaking when pulled apart), strength (the measure of the stress needed to break a polymer), and impact resistance (the measure of a polymer\u2019s resistance when impacted by a sharp and sudden stress).\nPaints and Coatings\nHalloysite has been shown to improve the adhesion and impact resistance properties of polymer-based paints and coatings. Additionally, halloysite has been shown to significantly improve the corrosion resistance of paints and coatings over synthetic anti-corrosion agents. Paints and coatings are one of the application markets on which BASF is focused as part of its Supply Agreement with the Company.\nOther Opportunities.\nOther potential markets that present opportunities for halloysite but as to which the Company does not have commercial customers include cement (halloysite may increase tensile strength more than twice the increase in compressive strength while reducing permeability), batteries (the silicon material in halloysite, which is an aluminasilicate, may be extracted from halloysite and used in anode in lithium ion batteries and halloysite may be used in electrolyte in batteries), and controlled release carrier in cosmetics and in other applications.\nAMIRON\nThe AMIRON line of natural iron oxide-based products can be used in technical and pigmentary application markets. In October 2019 the Company signed an agreement to supply a manufacture of cement up to 30,000 tons of AMIRON per year over a two-year period. The Company expects to sell the majority of its iron production to this customer during 2020.\nTHE SALES PROCESS\nThe Company sells its products using employees, agents, and distributors, selling on a global basis.\nDRAGONITE\nThe Company markets its DRAGONITE into two general types of application markets.\nThe first type is a market in which halloysite has not been previously used, or is to be used as an additive in substitution for another additive, to enhance a functionality of an application. This type of market requires a number of steps to be completed before a sale can be consummated. Like any new material that will be incorporated into a commercial manufacturing process, a significant amount of testing must be performed by a customer before DRAGONITE can be incorporated into a manufacturing process and a product. Sales of this type often require working with the potential customers\u2019 existing formulations, which can vary from potential customer to potential customer.\nWorking with a potential customer could include identifying a solution, such as (i) surface coating or (ii) when to introduce DRAGONITE into the formulation or (iii) the conditions under which it should be introduced or (iv) changes, deletions, additions, or substitutions involving other elements of the customer\u2019s formulation. Without the customer\u2019s collaboration in identifying a solution, DRAGONITE could be unsuccessful in achieving the customer\u2019s goals. This process can take an extended period of time (years in the case of discoloration of polymers as a result of the introduction of DRAGONITE) and, in some cases, there is no solution. In this type of market, price can be an important consideration and in some cases, we are not able to compete.\nThe second type of market is one in which halloysite clay is currently being used in traditional application markets. Within these established markets, we believe our DRAGONITE products often offers an enhanced value proposition with respect to purity and other properties sought by customers, although in some cases DRAGONITE\u2019s purity and/or other properties may not be required or useful. The pricing of our products relative to those of our competitors, however, will always be a significant factor in determining our ability to penetrate these markets.\nAMIRON\nThe Company encounters the same types of challenges marketing AMIRON, as it faces in marketing DRAGONITE. In particular, the Company must compete on price and quality in relation to competitive materials.\nThe Company is not currently devoting significant efforts or resources to marketing AMIRON. It cannot be assured that we will be successful in penetrating markets for AMIRON.\nRESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING\nThe Company\u2019s research and development and testing efforts are focused on the continued creation of commercial applications for our halloysite-based products and our iron oxides. The Company conducts research and development efforts internally and occasionally through consultants. The Company is using BASF to conduct research. The Company also conducts product research and development collaboratively with distributors, customers and potential customers.\nIn 2019 and 2018, the Company spent approximately $18,800 and $0 on testing and research, respectively.\nTRADEMARKS AND PATENTS\nWe have trademarked the name DRAGONITE and AMIRON. We believe these trademarks are important to the successful marketing of our product offering.\nREGULATION\nThe Utah Department of Natural Resources sets the guidelines for exploration and other mineral related activities based on provisions of the Mined Land Reclamation Act, Title 40-8, Utah Code Annotated 1953, as amended, and the General Rules and Rules of Practice and Procedures, R647-1 through R647-5. We have received a large mine permit from the Department. The Company does not believe that such regulations, including environmental regulations, have or will adversely affect the Company\u2019s business or have a material impact on capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company.\nWe carry a Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) license (#4202383) for the Dragon Mine and report as required to MSHA. The Company is subject to extensive regulation and periodic inspections by the Mine Safety and Health Administration, which was created by the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The regulations generally are designed to assure the health and safety of miners and our mine is periodically inspected by MSHA. The Company does not believe that such regulations have or will materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business or have a material impact on capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company.\nThe clays that the Company mines, including halloysite, may contain various levels of crystalline silica when mined. Crystalline silica is considered a hazardous substance under regulations promulgated by the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) and U.S. Mine Health and Safety Administration (MSHA) and as a result is subject to permissible exposure limits (PELs), both in the mine and at the workplaces of our customers. The Company is required to provide Safety Data Sheets (SDS) at the mine and accompanying sales of products to customers. The Company must also apply hazard warning to labels of containers of the product sold to customers, if levels of crystalline silica are present above specified thresholds. Kaolin and halloysite are also subject to PELs.\nEMPLOYEES\nAs of May 29, 2020, the Company had 11 employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, we have never experienced a work stoppage, and we consider our labor relations to be excellent.",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES IS VERY SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS, ALONG WITH THE OTHER MATTERS RELATED TO RISK REFERRED TO HEREIN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO BUY OUR SECURITIES. IF YOU DECIDE TO BUY OUR SECURITIES, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO AFFORD A COMPLETE LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT.\nOur business activities are subject to significant risks, including those described below. Every investor, or potential investor, in our securities should carefully consider these risks. If any of the described risks actually occurs, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Such risks are not the only ones we face, and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also significantly and adversely affect our business.\nSPECIFIC RISKS APPLICABLE TO APPLIED MINERALS\nLOSSES, DEFICITS, GOING CONCERN.\nWe have experienced annual operating losses for as long as we have financial records (since 1998). For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company sustained losses from continuing operations of $5,973,132 and $3,325,993, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had accumulated deficits of $118,734,429 and $107,819,850, respectively. We have very limited cash as of the date of this report, negative cash flow, and continuing unprofitable operations. Accordingly, our independent registered public accounting firm, MaloneBailey, LLP, has included a going concern paragraph in its opinion on our financial statements.\nWe may need to seek additional financing to support our continued operations; however, there are no assurances that any such financing can be obtained on favorable terms, if at all, especially in light of the restrictions imposed on the incurrence of additional debt by the Series A Notes and the Series 2023 Notes.\nMaterial Weakness in our Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock.\nDuring the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, we and our independent registered public accounting firm, identified deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Management determined the control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in the trading price of our stock\nMATURITY OF OUTSTANDING PIK-ELECTION CONVERTIBLE NOTES.\nUnless the Company becomes quite successful its outstanding PIK-Election Convertible Notes may not elect to voluntarily convert into common stock. Unless the Company is able to generate significant cash flow, the Company may not have sufficient funds to pay outstanding PIK-Election Convertible Notes when such notes mature. Unless the stock price increases very significantly, the Company may not be able to force conversion of the notes before maturity.\nThe Company has two series of convertible, PIK notes outstanding, 3% PIK-Election Convertible Notes due May 1, 2023 (\"Series A Notes\") and 3% PIK-Election Notes due August 1, 2023 (\u201cSeries 2023 Notes\u201d). As of May 29, 2020, the outstanding balance of the Series A Notes was approximately $28.7 million and the outstanding balance of the Series 2023 Notes was approximately $17.0 million. If the Company continues to pay interest in additional PIK Notes, the outstanding balances will increase to approximately $50.4 million in 2023.\nThe description of the risks associated with maturity and mandatory conversion set forth below is limited to the Series A Notes, but the risks related to the Series 2013 Notes are similar.\nThe Series A Notes mature on May 1, 2023. The Series 2023 Notes mature on August 1, 2023.\nThe holders of the Series A Notes may convert their principal and accrued but unpaid interest into shares of common stock of the Company at any time. As of May 29, 2020, the conversion price of the Series A Notes was $0.40 per share and would have converted into approximately 71.6 million shares of common stock of the Company. As of May 29, 2020, the conversion price of the Series 2023 Notes was $0.59 per shares and would have converted into approximately 28.8 million shares of common stock of the Company.\nThe Series A Notes are mandatorily convertible by the Company at any time when (i) the volume weighted average price of the shares of the common stock of the Company is equal to or greater than $1.00 for thirty (30) consecutive trading days and (ii) the closing market price of the shares of the common stock of the Company is equal to or greater than $1.00.\nThe Series 2023 are mandatorily convertible by the Company at any time when the weighted average trading price of a share of the Company\u2019s common stock is in excess of $0.59 for ten (10) consecutive trading days.\nThe Series A Notes and Series 2023 Notes contain significant negative covenants that limit or eliminate, without the consent of a majority by principal of the each series of Notes, among other things, mergers, sales of assets, dividends, borrowings, secured transactions, liens and transactions with affiliates.\nPENETRATING MARKETS\nFor the Company to survive, we must penetrate our target markets and achieve sales levels and generate sufficient cash flow to break-even. To be a success, we must do better than that. As outlined below, and in light of the disclosures above, there is significant uncertainty that we will be able to do so.\nMany of the applications for which we are selling for our halloysite-based material are applications for which halloysite has not been used previously. As a result, there are a number of obstacles that we need to overcome to achieve sales in these markets. It may be necessary to convince manufacturers to change their manufacturing processes and substitute our halloysite-based material for the product they are currently using, and in some cases, to use our halloysite-based material where no product was used before.\nThe process beginning with introducing our halloysite-based material to manufacturers and ending with the manufacturers using our products in their production (i) can encounter inertia, skepticism, and different corporate priorities, (ii) requires educating potential customers (some of whom can be resistant) on whether our product actually works for the manufacturer\u2019s particular need, the benefits of our material, and how to test and use our material (how much to add, when to add, and so forth), and (iii) often requires working with potential customers to assure that the potential customers test the materials under proper conditions to assure that our products provide the desired results, do not adversely affect the customer\u2019s product and do not interfere with the other constituents of, or processes to make, the customer\u2019s product. In summary, while we believe that our halloysite-based material often adds significant value, we can say two things about the process that ends with manufacturers using our halloysite-based material: it can take a long time and there is no certainty that we will be able to convince enough manufacturers to use our halloysite-base material.\nSimilarly, we have attempted to sell our iron oxides, which are natural, into markets where synthetic iron oxides have been used in the past. In trying to make such sales, we encounter the same or similar types of problems described in the preceding paragraph\nOther applications for our halloysite-based material and our iron oxides are applications for which halloysite or natural iron oxides have been used previously. To penetrate these markets, we face the difficulties encountered by any company trying to enter an established market competing against established players that may be in better financial condition that we are and are already familiar to, and in many cases have relationships with, the potential customers, which may make purchasing from such competitors more attractive than purchasing from us. While we believe that in many cases, our products are superior to those already in the market; there is uncertainty that we will be able to penetrate those markets to a sufficient degree. Because individual halloysite and iron oxide deposits can differ in significant respects, we may have to demonstrate that our halloysite or iron oxide will actually work for the manufacturer\u2019s particular need and thus we can encounter the problems discussed in the third paragraph of this section.\nCOMPETITION\nCompetition from Other Miners of Halloysite\nCurrently there is limited competition involving the sale of our halloysite-based DRAGONITE products in our advanced-applications target markets. If our DRAGONITE products penetrate our advanced-application target markets, we may face significant competition from competitors as well as from non-halloysite solutions often sold by larger, more established companies. The basis for competition is performance, price and reliability. The Company\u2019s pricing strategy is opportunistic and if significant competition develops, that strategy could be adversely affected.\nDespite the widespread occurrences of halloysite, large deposits from which high purity halloysite can be economically extracted are comparatively rare. These include deposits with high-grade zones that are dominantly halloysite and lower grade deposits where halloysite can be readily separated to give a high purity product. Relatively pure halloysite typically occurs as narrow lenses or pockets in altered rock and often requires selective mining and sorting to produce a high-grade product. Halloysite is often associated with fine-grained kaolinite, silica or other fine-grained mineral contaminants and as such, for many applications, requiring beneficiation methods that rely primarily on wet processing.\nTo our knowledge, significant production of high-grade halloysite from large deposits for specialist industrial use at present is limited to the Dragon Mine and open pit mines owned by Imerys, a large French minerals company, in Northland, New Zealand, and in mines in Turkey and in China\nThe New Zealand mines produce about 15,000 tons of halloysite per year. The raw clay from New Zealand contains around 50% halloysite, 50% silica minerals (quartz, cristobalite, tridymite, amorphous silica), and minor feldspar. It must be processed to eliminate the crystalline silica materials. A 2014 Safety Data Sheet for Imerys\u2019 product states \u201cThis product contains between 1% and 10% of quartz (fine fraction), and quartz (fine fraction) is classified as STOT RE1, which means definitely toxic to humans or toxic effect was determined in animal experiments after repeated exposure.\u201d\nOur Safety Data Sheet indicates that our processed halloysite \u201cmay contain naturally occurring Respirable Crystalline Silica (CAS #\u2019s 14808-60-7 and 14464-46-1) at trace concentration levels below HazCom 2012 and GHS Revision 3 hazard classification limits. Per XRC analysis, which combines the analytical capabilities of X-Ray Diffraction, Computer Controlled Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy and Raman Spectroscopy to conduct particle-by-particle inter-instrumental relocation and physicochemical/mineralogical analysis - naturally occurring trace level substances in these products, including Respirable Crystalline Silica, are inextricably bound, environmentally unavailable and at de minimis concentrations. Thus, in the current and anticipated future physical state of these products, they are believed to be incapable of causing harm under normal conditions of use or as a result of extreme upset.\u201d Our halloysite does not contain cristobalite.\nImerys\u2019 halloysite has low amounts of Fe2O3. Some of our raw halloysite may contain more Fe2O3 but it can be processed out through bleaching or can be reduced through blending with purer halloysite.\nTo our knowledge, Imerys has not made any significant efforts so that its halloysite can penetrate that advanced markets that the Company is attempting to penetrate.\nHalloysite from Turkey is sold for use in catalysts for a very low price, but it may not have the same functionality as the Company\u2019s halloysite. For some uses such functionality may not be necessary.\nHalloysite from China is being sold for use in molecular sieves.\nA company owning a deposit in Idaho claims to have proven and probable reserves of halloysite of 382,000 tons and that it will produce halloysite products and market them for some of several uses. Some of those uses are the same as the uses for which the Company is marketing its Dragonite.\nSmaller deposits occur in many countries including Japan, Korea, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, South America, and Europe. It is reported that halloysite from China, Brazil, Poland, and Turkey is sold commercially, but halloysite from other locations may be sold commercially. Halloysite is typically used for ceramics and paper coating.\nThe degree or extent to which the halloysite from other deposits can or will compete with our halloysite-based products is subject to a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf Deposits of halloysite are formed under a variety of geological conditions of hydrothermal alteration and weathering. As a result, the nature and extent of impurities, the length of the tube, thickness of the walls, and the size of the pore or lumen can all vary. In many deposits, the halloysite is mixed with significant amounts of other clays, limiting its usefulness for certain applications. Other deposits can contain significant amounts of crystalline silica and/or cristobalite, which may limit the usefulness for certain applications and/or require additional processing, although given the fine grain of silica and cristobalite, there are limits to the ability to eliminate them. Other deposits contain more iron oxide than is acceptable, requiring additional processing. Other deposits may be of high quality.\n\u25cf Some deposits are subject to difficulties relating to mining. Some deposits are located in geographically isolated areas.\nThe global resource base for economically mineable halloysite might be expanded to meet substantial growth in demand, especially if demand was for higher-value markets that would justify higher costs for mining and processing out containments. Such expansion might be anticipated both through the discovery of new deposits and through the adoption of more elaborate process methods to separate halloysite occurring within lower-grade sources. Competition from the other halloysite producers could arise and could adversely affect sales and margins and such competition would be based on performance and/or price. In particular, competition could affect the Company\u2019s sales strategy of opportunistic pricing.\nCompetition from Suppliers of Alternative Solutions to Halloysite\nWhen we market halloysite for use in situations where halloysite has not been previously used, or is to be used as an additive in substitution for another additive to enhance certain functionality of an application, we will face competition from suppliers of other solutions and the competition will be based on performance, price and reliability.\nCompetition for Iron Oxide\nWe expect to compete with companies that, in some cases, may be larger and better capitalized than us. Because individual iron oxide deposits can differ in significant respects, our iron oxide may not be suitable for certain uses and we may have to demonstrate that our iron oxide will actually work for the manufacturer\u2019s particular need and we can encounter problems in getting manufacturers to test our product and even if such tests are successful, to use our iron oxide. We also compete with synthetic iron oxide.\nTHE COMPANY\u2019S SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT\nOur senior management has played a critical role in leading the effort to commercialize our halloysite-based products and iron oxides. If the Company loses the services of members of senior management, there is no assurance that the Company would be able to attract and retain qualified replacements.\nOTHER MORE GENERALIZED RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nThe actual Dragon Mine profitability or economic feasibility may be adversely affected by any of the following factors, among others:\n\u25cf Changes in tonnage, grades and characteristics of mineralization to be mined and processed;\n\u25cf Higher input and labor costs;\n\u25cf The quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made;\n\u25cf Adverse geotechnical conditions;\n\u25cf Availability and cost of adequate and skilled labor force and supply and cost of water and power;\n\u25cf Availability and terms of financing;\n\u25cf Environmental or other government laws and regulations related to the Dragon Mine;\n\u25cf Changes in tax laws, including percentage depletion and net operating loss carryforwards;\n\u25cf Weather or severe climate impacts;\n\u25cf Potential delays relating to social and community issues;\n\u25cf Industrial accidents, including in connection with the operation of mining and transportation equipment and accidents associated with the preparation and ignition of blasting operations, milling equipment and conveyor systems;\n\u25cf Underground fires or floods;\n\u25cf Unexpected geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form);\n\u25cf Ground and water conditions;\n\u25cf Accidents in underground operations;\n\u25cf Failure of mining pit slopes;\n\u25cf Seismic activity; and\n\u25cf Other natural phenomena, such as lightning, cyclonic or storms, floods or other inclement weather conditions.\nTHERE IS COMPREHENSIVE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATION OF THE EXPLORATION AND MINING INDUSTRY THAT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT OUR MINING OPERATIONS.\nExploration and mining operations are subject to federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment, including laws regulating removal of natural resources from the ground, the discharge of materials into the environment, restoration the property after mining operations are completed. Exploration and mining operations and some of the products we sell are also subject to federal, state and/or local laws and regulations that seek to maintain health and safety standards. No assurance can be given that standards imposed by federal, state or local authorities will not be changed or that any such changes would not have material adverse effects on our activities, including mine closure. Moreover, compliance with such laws may cause substantial delays or require capital outlays in excess of those anticipated, thus causing an adverse effect on our financial position. Additionally, we may be subject to liability for pollution or other environmental damages that we may elect not to insure against due to prohibitive premium costs and other reasons.

PROPERTIES\nPRINCIPAL OFFICE\nThe corporate office is located at 55 Washington Street, Suite 301, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201.\nMINING PROPERTY\nThe following section describes our right, title, or claim to the Dragon Mine property.\nThe Dragon Mine property, located in Juab County, Utah, within the Tintic Mining District, has been principally exploited for halloysite clay and iron oxide. It is located approximately 2 miles southwest of Eureka, Utah and can be accessed via state highway and county road. There is no evidence of a water source on the property.\nThe property covers approximately 267 acres with a large mining permit covering 40 acres allowing for the extraction of minerals. The property consists of 38 patented and six unpatented mining claims located in the following sections: T10S, R2W, sections 29, 30, 31, and T10S, R3W, Section 36, all relative to the Salt Lake Base Meridian. The Company pays approximately $800 in annual maintenance fees to the U.S. Department of Interior Bureau of Land Management to maintain rights to its unpatented claims. The BLM Claim Numbers are: UMC385543, UMC 385544, UMC394659, UMC394660, UMC408539, and UMC408540.\nThe Company has no underlying royalty agreements with any third-party with respect to the Dragon Mine. We leased the property in 2001 and in 2005 we purchased the property for $500,000 in cash. As more fully explained in the \u201cBusiness\u201d section, the property has two mining areas, the Dragon Pit, which contains high purity halloysite, mixed clays and iron oxide and the Western Area, which contains mixed clays and iron oxides.\nProcessing Facilities at Dragon Mine; Plant and Equipment\nThe Company has two dry-process facilities at its Dragon Mine property. One facility, is able process halloysite clay and iron oxide, has a capacity of up to 45,000 ton per year for certain types of clay processing and includes a Hosokawa Alpine mill. Before processing, the mineral is crushed. If only crushing is needed for a particular product, our production capacity will be significantly higher. The other facility is dedicated to dry processing of halloysite clay resource and has an annual capacity of up to 10,000 tons per year.\nIn October 2017 we entered into a Purchase and Supply Agreement with BASF under which BASF, among other things, agreed to provide the Company with up to 15,000 tons of water-based processing capacity. During the fourth calendar quarter of 2019, BASF informed us of its intention to terminate its obligations under the Purchase and Supply Agreement. Per the terms of the termination of the agreement, BASF is obligated to provide the Company with water-based processing capacity into the first calendar quarter of 2021. The Company is currently seeking to obtain water-based processing capacity on a tolling basis to replace the capacity currently provided by BASF.\nWe believe the physical plant and equipment utilized at the Dragon Mine are in satisfactory condition to continue our current mining and processing activity except where the Company anticipates using a third party to beneficiate its halloysite. The Company continually reviews the adequacy of its physical plant and equipment inventory and expects to invest accordingly to ensure that the size and quality of its physical plant and equipment can meet its needs. Currently, our physical plant includes, but is not limited to, two processing mills, a dry house, a site office, a general storage facility, an equipment repair facility, and a structure housing three IR compressors, which are used to power the mill and certain drilling equipment used underground. Our mining equipment includes, but is not limited to, a road header, an underground drill, a deep drill, a skid steer, a front-end loader and a number of other pieces traditionally used to mine underground. There are some pieces of equipment we choose to rent on a daily basis rather than own or lease to own. The Company uses diesel fuel and propane and has water transported to the property from an external source. The property has sufficient access to roads to enable the transportation of materials and products. The property also has a well-equipped laboratory used for quality control and research.\nSEC Industry Guide 7 and Resource Study\nAs of the filing of this report, the Company was classified as an exploration stage company for purposes of Industry Guide 7 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nUnder Industry Guide 7, companies engaged in significant mining operations are classified into three categories, referred to as \u201cstages\u201d- exploration, development, and production. Exploration stage includes all companies engaged in the search for mineral deposits (reserves). In order to be classified as a development or production stage company, a company must have already established reserves. Unless a company has established reserves, it cannot be classified as a development or production stage company, notwithstanding the nature and extent of development-type or production- type activities that have been undertaken or completed.\nThe Company has commissioned a study of the mine\u2019s \u201cresources\u201d that was conducted using the standards of the JORC Code of the Australasian Code for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. The mineralization described in the study does not qualify as reserves under Industry Guide 7.\nIn 2018, SEC adopted rules to modernize property disclosures for mining companies. Such rules go into effect in 2021. The mineralization indicated by the resource study would not qualify as a reserve under the new rules.\nFor purposes of Industry Guide 7, a consequence of the absence of reserves is that the mining company, such as the Company, is deemed to lack an objective basis to assert that it has a deposit with mineralization that can be economically and legally extracted or produced and sold to produce revenue.\nDespite the fact that the Company has not established reserves, the Company has mined, processed and sold, and intends to continue to mine, process, and sell, halloysite clay and iron oxide from the Dragon Mine.\nExploration Agreement\nOn December 22, 2017, the Company and Continental Mineral Claims, Inc. (\u201cCMC\u201d) entered into an Exploration Agreement with Option to Purchase (\u201cAgreement\u201d). The Company granted to CMC the exclusive right and option to enter upon and conduct mineral exploration activities (the \u201cExploration License\u201d) for Metallic Minerals on the Company\u2019s Dragon Mine minesite in Utah (the \u201cMining Claims\u201d). Metallic Minerals are defined to include minerals with a high specific gravity and metallic luster, such as gold, silver, lead, copper, zinc, molybdenum, titanium, tungsten, uranium, tin, iron, etc., but shall exclude any such Metallic Minerals that are intermingled within any economically-recoverable, non-metallic mineral deposits located at or above an elevation of 5,590 feet above sea level. Non-metallic minerals include clay and iron oxide, the minerals mined by the Company. The Company believes that all economic recoverable non-metallic mineral deposits are well above 5,590 feet above sea level. The Exploration License is for a period of ten years.\nIn consideration of the Exploration License CMC paid the Company $350,000 upon the execution of the agreement and paid it $150,000 on the first anniversary of the Exploration License in December 2018. CMC will pay the Company $250,000 on or before each subsequent anniversary during the Exploration License term following the first anniversary of the Effective Date of this Agreement unless the Exploration License is terminated earlier by CMC by exercising the option or failing to make the required payment for the Exploration License.\nIn March 2020 CMC exercised its option to acquire 100% of the Metallic Rights within the Mining Claims from the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. The proceeds paid to the Company upon the exercise of the option totalled $1,050,000.\nUpon the exercise of the option, the Company retained the all rights and title to (1) the surface interest (with exception of those rights associated with the Metallic Rights), and (2) all non-metallic minerals (expressly including all industrial minerals including clays and iron oxides).\nUpon the exercise of the option the Company retained protections against unreasonable interference of its current and future mining operations by CMC. CMC may not do anything that may, at the Company\u2019s determination, adversely impact the Company\u2019s Mining Operations. \u201cMining Operations\u201d shall mean the activities incident to mineral extraction, permitting, and any operations by CMC or the Company relating to the removal of minerals, respectively, that are or may reasonably be conducted on the Mining Claims, including the exploration for, and development, active mining, removing, producing and selling of any minerals, including the Metallic Minerals. The Agreement states that the parties understand that the Company is willing to enter into the Agreement only if it is assured that CMC will not have any right to unreasonably interfere with the Company\u2019s current mining operations and possible future Mining Operations on the Mining Claims.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nApplied Minerals, Inc. is a global producer of DRAGONITE halloysite clay and AMIRON advanced natural iron oxides. We are a vertically integrated operation focused on developing grades of DRAGONITE and AMIRON that can be utilized for both traditional and advanced end-market applications. We have mineral production capacity of up to approximately 55,000 tons per year.\nSee \u201cITEM 1. BUSINESS\u201d for further details regarding both our business strategy.\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Financial Statements\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of COVID-19 was reported in China. Since then, COVID-19 has spread globally, to include Canada, the United States and several European countries. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a \u201cpandemic,\u201d or a worldwide spread of a new disease, on March 11, 2020. Many countries around the world have imposed quarantines and restrictions on travel and mass gatherings to slow the spread of the virus and have closed non-essential businesses.\nAs local jurisdictions continue to put restrictions in place, our ability to continue to operate our business may also be limited. Such events may result in a period of business, supply and product manufacturing disruption, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In response to COVID-19, the Company implemented remote working and thus far, has not experienced a significant disruption or delay in our operations\nTo date, COVID-19 has not had a material financial impact on the Company. However, COVID-19 has caused severe disruptions in transportation and limited access to the Company\u2019s facility, resulting in limited support from its staff and professional advisors. The small size of the Company\u2019s accounting staff and the additional responsibilities emanating from COVID-19 have presented difficulties to the Company\u2019s ability to complete this Report on Form 10-K, resulting in its delay, and may continue to cause a delay in the Company\u2019s ability to complete subsequent reports in a timely manner.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe following accounting policies have been identified by management as policies critical to the Company\u2019s financial reporting:\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and market-specific or other relevant assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the Company\u2019s balance sheets and the amount of expenses and income reported for each of the periods presented are affected by estimates and assumptions, which are used for, but are not limited to, determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, warrant and PIK note derivative liabilities, stock compensation, impairment of long-lived assets and valuation allowance on income taxes. Actual results could differ from such estimates or assumptions.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company periodically reviews the carrying amounts of long-lived assets to determine whether current events or circumstances warrant adjustment to such carrying amounts. Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset to its carrying amount. If this comparison indicates that there is impairment, the amount of the impairment is typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows where observable fair values are not readily determinable. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of assets. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their financial statement carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell.\nRECENT ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. This ASU eliminates, modifies, and adds disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact the standard will have on its financial statements.\nIn November 2018, FASB issued ASU 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction Between Topic 808 and Topic 606, which, among other things, provides guidance on how to assess whether certain collaborative arrangement transactions should be accounted for under Topic 606. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact the standard will have on its financial statements.\nResults of Operations - 2019 Compared to 2018\nThe following sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain components of our operating earnings, including such data stated as percentage of revenues:\n* Includes $249,116 and $533,089 of non-cash stock compensation expense for 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to employee, director and consultant stock options.\nRevenue generated during 2019 was $486,046 compared to $4,873,161 of revenue generated during the same period in 2018, a decrease of $4,387,115 or 90%. The decrease was driven primarily by the absence in 2019 of the sale of the Company\u2019s five surface piles to a leading building products and construction materials group for total proceeds of $4,546,145 that took place in 2018. The surface piles consisted of approximately 4.5 million tons of extracted material comprised primarily of clay and iron oxide. Per the terms of the agreement, the purchaser of the five surface piles will pay the Company an additional $1.00 for every ton of surface pile material it eventually removes from the Dragon Mine property.\nExcluding the sale of the Company\u2019s five surface piles, revenue during 2019 increased $159,030, or 49%, versus revenue of $327,016 in 2018. Sales of DRAGONITE during 2019 totaled $413,587, a decline of $322,426, or 28%, when compared to 2018. Sales of AMIRON during 2019 totaled $67,459, an increase of $66,488, or approximately 6,850%, when compared to 2018. During 2019 the Company generated $5,000 from tolling clay for a third-party. During 2018 the Company generated $3,620 of equipment rental revenue.\nThe $91,161 increase in sales of DRAGONITE during 2019 was due primarily to $288,000 sale to a manufacturer of advanced molecular sieves, partially offset by a decline in sales comprised of (i) $86,918 to a manufacturer of flame retardant additives, (ii) $36,000 to a manufacturer of plastic lawn and garden equipment, (iii) $25,941 to a distributor of R&D chemicals, (iv) $22,500 to a manufacturer of ceramic clay bodies, and (v) $18,006 to a distributor of specialty chemicals.\nThe $66,488 increase in sales of AMIRON was driven primarily by sales to a manufacturer of cement that did not occur during 2018. .\nOperating expenses incurred during 2019 totalled $4,529,483, a decrease of $2,344,387, or 34%, when compared to 2018. The decline in operating expenses was driven primarily by a $294,418 decline in production costs, a 1,047,501 decline in asset impairment and a 1,277,953 decline in depreciation expense, partially offset by a $274,819 increase in general and administrative expense.\nProduction costs include those operating expenses which management believes are directly related to the mining and processing of the Company\u2019s iron oxide and halloysite minerals, which result in the production of its AMIRON and DRAGONITE products for commercial sale. Production costs include, but are not limited to, wages and benefits of employees who mine material and who work in the Company\u2019s milling operations, energy costs associated with the operation of the Company\u2019s two mills, the cost of mining and milling supplies and the cost of the maintenance and repair of the Company\u2019s mining and milling equipment. Wages and energy expenses are the two largest components of the Company\u2019s production costs.\nProduction costs during 2019 were $934,865, a decline of $294,418, or 24%, when compared to 2018. Productions costs during 2019 declined mainly due to a $108,143 reduction in clay processing expense due to lower volumes of clay master batch produced in 2019 and a $234,097 reduction in sales commission related to the sale of the Company\u2019s surface piles in August, 2018 partially offset by an increase of $50,411 in repair & maintenance and $57,469 in energy costs.\nExploration costs include operating expenses incurred at the Dragon Mine that are not directly related to production activities. Exploration costs, excluding depreciation expense, incurred during 2019 totalled $196,351 compared to $195,685 incurred during 2018, an increase of $666.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for 2019 totalled $3,398,267 compared to $3,123,448 of expense incurred during the same period in 2018, an increase of $274,819 or 9%. The Company\u2019s general and administrative expenses are associated with expenses incurred at its New York operations. The largest component of the Company\u2019s general and administrative expense includes employee compensation and expense related to the issuance of stock options to employees and consultants. The decrease was primarily driven by reduction of $101,909 in employee compensation, $69,426 in professional fees and $74,027 in stock-based compensation expenses to employees and consultants.\nOperating loss incurred during the year was $4,043,437, an increase of $2,042,728, or 102%, when compared to 2018. The increase was driven primarily by a $4,387,115 decrease in revenue partially offset by a decrease in total operating expenses of $2,344,387.\nTotal other expense for 2019 was $1,929,695 compared to $1,325,284 during the same period in 2018, an increase of $604,411 or 46%. The increase in total other expense was driven primarily by a $478,591, or 100%, decrease in the gain on the revaluation of PIK Note derivative liability due to the elimination of its valuation in 2019, a $ $241,560, or 49%, decrease on other income due primarily to a decline in exploration lease payments received from Continental Mineral Claims, Inc., and a $115,740, or 5%, decrease in interest expenses associated with PIK Notes and amortization expense associated with the PIK Note discount partially.\nNet loss for 2019 was $5,973,132, an increase of $2,647,139, or 80%, when compared to a net loss of $3,325,993 for 2018. The increase in net loss was driven primarily by the $2,042,728, or 102%, increase in operating loss and a $604,411, or 64%, increase in total other expense compared to 2018.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company has a history of recurring losses from operations and the use of cash in operating activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s net loss was $5,973,132 and cash used in operating activities was $2,380,328. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had current assets of $415,309 and current liabilities of $2,430,707 of which $176,903 was accrued PIK Note interest to be paid in additional PIK Notes. The Company\u2019s current liabilities also include (i) $135,392 of disputed or erroneously accrued expenses for which the Company believes it will eventually reverse, (ii) $119,269 of payables to a toll processor which has agreed to be paid in-kind with halloysite clay, (iii) $426,672 of accrued salaries and related payroll taxes related to the deferral of management compensation, (iv) $721,219 of accrued directors\u2019 fees, and (v) $250,000 of a note payable due to Overlook Investment, LLC.\nCash used in operating activities in 2019 was $2,380,328 compared to $1,325,266 of cash provided during the same period in 2018. Cash used in operating activities during 2019, after adjusting for non-cash items but before adjusting for changes in operating assets and liabilities, was $3,595,185 compared to $1,403,549 of cash provided during the comparable period in 2018. The primary reason for this decrease was the $4,137,115 decrease in revenue in 2019 compared to 2018.\nCash used in investing activities during 2019 was $0 compared to $23,063 during the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to acquire less equipment in 2019.\nCash used in financing activities during 2019 was $459,220 compared to $1,542,485 cash provided in 2018. The $2,001,705 decrease was due primarily to a decrease of 1,735,000 in proceeds generated from the sale of common stock and $80,000 in proceeds generated from exercise of warrants, an increase of $30,137 payments on notes payable and an increase of $356,568 payments on PIK notes, partially offset by an increase of $200,000 in proceeds generated from notes payable issuance.\nOur total assets as of December 31, 2019 were $1,489,180 compared to $4,136,978 as of December 31, 2018, or a decrease of $2,647,798. The decrease in total assets was due primarily to a $2,839,547 decrease in cash.\nManagement believes that in order for the Company to meet its obligations arising from normal business operations through May 29, 2021 that the Company may be required (i) to raise additional capital either in the form of a private placement of common stock or debt and/or (ii) generate additional sales of its products that will generate sufficient operating profit and cash flows to fund operations. Without additional capital or additional sales of its products, the Company\u2019s ability to continue to operate may be limited.\nBased on the Company\u2019s current cash usage expectations, management believes it may not have sufficient liquidity to fund its operations through May 29, 2021. Further, management cannot provide any assurance that it is probable that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans to raise debt or equity financing or generate additional product sales. Collectively these factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company\u2019s ability to continue as going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a going concern.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThere are no off-balance sheet arrangements between the Company and any other entity that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 that require us to make future cash payments. For contractual obligations, we included payments that we have an unconditional obligation to make:\nRent expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $114,000 and $127,000, respectively.",

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of\nApplied Minerals, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Applied Minerals, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders\u2019 deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern Matter\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ MaloneBailey, LLP\nwww.malonebailey.com\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2018.\nHouston, Texas\nMay 29, 2020\nAPPLIED MINERALS, INC.\n(An Exploration Stage Mining Company)\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nAPPLIED MINERALS, INC.\n(An Exploration Stage Mining Company)\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nAPPLIED MINERALS, INC.\n(An Exploration Stage Mining Company)\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders\u2019 (Deficit)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nAPPLIED MINERALS, INC.\n(An Exploration Stage Mining Company)\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nAPPLIED MINERALS, INC.\n(An Exploration Stage Mining Company)\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nAPPLIED MINERALS, INC.\n(An Exploration Stage Mining Company)\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nApplied Minerals, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is the owner of the Dragon Mine located in the Tintic Mining District of the State of Utah from where it produces halloysite clay and iron oxide. The Company is currently selling its DRAGONITE halloysite clay product regularly to four customers. Several prospective customers are conducting either commercial-scale trials or field trials for an array of products that are expected to use DRAGONITE as a functional additive. In October 2019 the Company entered into an agreement to supply a manufacturer of cement with up to 30,000 tons AMIRON iron oxide per year over a two-year period.\nApplied Minerals, Inc. is a publicly traded company incorporated in the state of Delaware. The common stock trades on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol \u201cAMNL.\u201d\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Financial Statements\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of COVID-19 was reported in China. Since then, COVID-19 has spread globally, to include Canada, the United States and several European countries. The spread of COVID-19 from China to other countries has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a \u201cpandemic,\u201d or a worldwide spread of a new disease, on March 11, 2020. Many countries around the world have imposed quarantines and restrictions on travel and mass gatherings to slow the spread of the virus and have closed non-essential businesses.\nAs local jurisdictions continue to put restrictions in place, our ability to continue to operate our business may also be limited. Such events may result in a period of business, supply and product manufacturing disruption, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In response to COVID-19, the Company implemented remote working and thus far, has not experienced a significant disruption or delay in our operations\nTo date, COVID-19 has not had a financial impact on the Company. However, COVID-19 has caused severe disruptions in transportation and limited access to the Company\u2019s facility, resulting in limited support from its staff and professional advisors. The small size of the Company\u2019s accounting staff and the additional responsibilities emanating from COVID-19 have presented difficulties to the Company\u2019s ability to complete this Report on Form 10-K, resulting in its delay, and may continue to cause a delay in the Company\u2019s ability to complete subsequent reports in a timely manner.\nNOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThe Company has a history of recurring losses from operations and the use of cash in operating activities. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s net loss was $5,973,132 and cash used in operating activities was $2,380,327. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had current assets of $415,309 and current liabilities of $2,430,707 of which $176,903 was accrued PIK Note interest to be paid in additional PIK Notes. The Company\u2019s current liabilities also include (i) $135,392 of disputed or erroneously accrued expenses for which the Company believes it will eventually reverse, (ii) $119,269 of payables to a toll processor the has agreed to be paid in-kind with halloysite clay, (iii) $426,672 of accrued salaries and related payroll taxes related to the deferral of management compensation, (iv) $721,219 of accrued directors\u2019 fees, and (v) $250,000 of a note payable due to Overlook Investment, LLC.\nBased on the Company\u2019s current cash usage expectations, management believes it may not have sufficient liquidity to fund its operations through May 29, 2021. Furthermore, management cannot provide any assurance that that the Company would be successful in funding operations through (i) the issuance of debt and/or equity financing, (ii) the sale of non-core assets and/or (iii) the generation of increased product sales. Collectively these factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company\u2019s ability to continue as going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a going concern.\nManagement believes that for the Company to meet its obligations arising from normal business operations through May 29, 2021 it may need to (i) raise additional capital through the sale of common stock and/or debt, (ii) generate proceeds through the sale of non-core assets and/or (iii) the generation of increased product sale. Without additional capital or additional sales of its products, the Company\u2019s ability to continue to operate may be limited.\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nExploration-Stage Company\nEffective January 1, 2009, the Company was, and still is, classified as an \u201cexploration stage\u201d company for purposes of Industry Guide 7 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) Under Industry Guide 7, companies engaged in significant mining operations are classified into three categories, referred to as \u201cstages\u201d - exploration, development, and production. Exploration stage includes all companies that do not have established reserves in accordance with Industry Guide 7. Such companies are deemed to be \u201cin the search for mineral deposits.\u201d Notwithstanding the nature and extent of development-type or production-type activities that have been undertaken or completed, a company cannot be classified as a development or production stage company unless it has established reserves in accordance with Industry Guide 7\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Applied Minerals, Inc. and its inactive subsidiary, which holds 100 acres of timber and mineral property in northern Idaho.\nBasis of Presentation\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and market-specific or other relevant assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the Company\u2019s balance sheets and the amount of expenses and income reported for each of the periods presented are affected by estimates and assumptions, which are used for, but are not limited to, determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, warrant and PIK note derivative liabilities, stock compensation, impairment of long-lived assets and valuation allowance on income taxes. Actual results could differ from such estimates or assumptions.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents represent unrestricted cash on hand and all highly liquid investments with original contractual maturities of three months or less.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nCash balances, accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments are financial instruments potentially subject to credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained in bank deposit accounts, which, at times, may exceed the federally insured limits. Management periodically reviews and assesses the financial condition of the banks to mitigate the risk of loss.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, revenues from the Company\u2019s largest two customers accounted for 73%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from the Company\u2019s largest customer account for 94% of total revenues. Excluding the sale of the surface piles in August 2018, revenue from the Company\u2019s largest two customers in 2018 accounted for 56%. As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, amounts owed from these customers comprised 0% of accounts receivable.\nReceivables\nTrade receivables are reported at outstanding principal amounts, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.\nManagement evaluates the collectability of receivable account balances to determine the allowance, if any. Management considers the other party\u2019s credit risk and financial condition, as well as current and projected economic and market conditions, in determining the amount of the allowance. Receivable balances are written off when management determines that the balance is uncollectable. No allowance was required at December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter, as follows:\nEstimated\nUseful Life\n(years)\nBuilding and Building Improvements\n5 - 40\nMining equipment\n2 - 7\nOffice and shop furniture and equipment\n3 - 7\nVehicles\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe Company periodically reviews the carrying amounts of long-lived assets to determine whether current events or circumstances warrant adjustment to such carrying amounts. Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset to its carrying amount. If this comparison indicates that there is impairment, the amount of the impairment is typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows where observable fair values are not readily determinable. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of assets. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their financial statement carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. The Company recorded a $0 and $1,047,501 impairment of its long-lived assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue includes sales of halloysite clay and iron oxide, and is recognized when title passes to the buyer and when collectability is reasonably assured. Title passes to the buyer based on terms of the sales contract. Product pricing is determined based on contractual arrangements with the Company\u2019s customers.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC Topic 606. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued guidance on revenue recognition, which provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance. The main principle under this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue at the amount it expects to be entitled to in exchange for the transfer of goods or services to customers.\nThe Company identified the predominant changes to its accounting policies resulting from the application of this guidance and quantified the impact on its consolidated financial statements. The cumulative effect of the initial adoption of this guidance did not have any significant impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements as the Company did not have any significant customer contracts in place at December 31, 2017. As a result, comparative prior periods have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (\u201cASC 605\u201d).\nThe Company\u2019s revenue recognition policies are established in accordance with the Revenue Recognition topics of ASC 606, and accordingly, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nMining Exploration and Development Costs\nLand and mining property are carried at cost. The Company expenses prospecting and mining exploration costs. At the point when a property is determined to have proven and probable reserves, subsequent development costs will be capitalized and will be charged to operations using the units-of-production method over proven and probable reserves. Upon abandonment or sale of a mineral property, all capitalized costs relating to the specific property are written off in the period abandoned or sold and a gain or loss is recognized.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company uses an asset and liability approach which results in the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences or benefits of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. A full valuation allowance has been provided for the Company\u2019s net deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized.\nAuthoritative guidance provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return can be recognized in our financial statements only if the position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position. As of December 31, 2019, no benefit from uncertain tax positions was recognized in our financial statements. The Company has elected to classify interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nStock Options and Warrants\nThe Company follows ASC 718 (Stock Compensation) and 505-50 (Equity-Based Payments to Non-employees), which provide guidance in accounting for share-based awards exchanged for services rendered and requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of these awards over the requisite service period. The Company instituted a formal long-term and short-term incentive plan on November 20, 2012, which was approved by its shareholders. Prior to that date, we did not have a formal equity plan, but all equity grants, including stock options and warrants, were approved by our Board of Directors. We determine the fair value of the stock-based compensation awards granted to non-employees as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either of (1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date at which the counterparty\u2019s performance is complete. Beginning in the quarter ended June 30, 2013 the Company began using the simplified method to determine the expected term for any options granted because the Company did not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The Company previously utilized the contractual term as the expected term.\nEnvironmental Matters\nExpenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental regulations that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures resulting from the remediation of existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenue generations are expensed. Liabilities are recognized when environmental assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated.\nEstimates of such liabilities are based upon currently available facts, existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations taking into consideration the likely effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors and include estimates of associated legal costs. These amounts also reflect prior experience in remediating contaminated sites, other companies\u2019 clean-up experience and data released by The Environmental Protection Agency or other organizations. Such estimates are by their nature imprecise and can be expected to be revised over time because of changes in government regulations, operations, technology, and inflation. Recoveries are evaluated separately from the liability and, when recovery is assured, the Company records and reports an asset separately from the associated liability.\nThe Company has posted a cash bond in the amount of $295,000 required by the Utah Department of Oil, Gas and Minerals to cover estimated reclamation costs related the Company large mining permit for its Dragon Mine property.\nReclassification\nCertain amounts reported in prior year in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year\u2019s presentation.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all of their leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The liability is equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset is based on the liability, subject to certain adjustments, such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, a dual model was retained, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance leases. Operating leases result in straight-line expense (similar to operating leases under the prior accounting standard) while finance leases result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to capital leases under the prior accounting standard). Lessor accounting is similar to the prior model, but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model (e.g., certain definitions, such as initial direct costs, have been updated) and the new revenue recognition standard that was adopted in 2018.\nThe Company adopted this new accounting standard on January 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and applied the new standard to all leases through a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings. As a result, comparative financial information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which includes, among other things, the ability to carry forward the existing lease classification. The new standard had a material impact on the unaudited consolidated balance sheet but did not materially impact the Company\u2019s consolidated operating results and had no impact on the Company\u2019s cash flows.\nThe following is a discussion of the Company\u2019s lease policy under the new lease accounting standard:\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company\u2019s leases is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement and exclude lease incentives.\nImpact of New Lease Standard on Balance Sheet Line Items\nAs a result of applying the new lease standard using a modified retrospective method, the following adjustments were made to accounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019:\nSee Note 4 for additional information\nASU 2017-11, Part I accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features\nIn July 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-11 to simplify the accounting for equity contracts (e.g., freestanding warrants) or equity-linked embedded features (e.g., conversion options in convertible instruments) with down round features. Under the new guidance, entities are no longer required to consider down round features when determining whether these financial instruments containing a down round feature are indexed to the issuer\u2019s own stock pursuant to ASC 815-40. Being indexed to an entity\u2019s own stock is required for a freestanding financial instrument to be classified in shareholders\u2019 equity and may exempt an embedded feature from bifurcation and derivative accounting.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2017-11 on January 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and applied the new standard to all financial instruments with down round features through a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings. As a result, comparative financial information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. On January 1, 2019, the Company recorded a transition adjustment to reduce retained earnings by $4,950,396. The new standard had a material impact on the unaudited consolidated balance sheet but did not materially impact the Company\u2019s consolidated operating results and had no impact on the Company\u2019s cash flows.\nImpact of ASU 2017-11 on Balance Sheet Line Items\nAs a result of applying ASU 2017-11 using a modified retrospective method, the following adjustments were made to accounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019:\nSee Note 8 for additional information\nASU 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting\nEffective January 1, 2019 the Company adopted ASU 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The guidance expands the scope of ASC 718 to include share-based payments granted to nonemployees in exchange for goods or services used or consumed in an entity\u2019s own operations and supersedes the guidance in ASC 505-50. The adoption of ASU 2018-07 had no material impact on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nRecent Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. This ASU eliminates, modifies, and adds disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact the standard will have on its financial statements.\nIn November 2018, FASB issued ASU 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction Between Topic 808 and Topic 606, which, among other things, provides guidance on how to assess whether certain collaborative arrangement transactions should be accounted for under Topic 606. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact the standard will have on its financial statements.\nNOTE 4 - LEASES\nOn March 16, 2017, the Company entered into a 5-year operating lease agreement for permanent office space, base rent payment is approximately $9,000 per month, subject to annual adjustments.\nThe following table summarizes the maturity of lease liabilities under operating leases as of December 31, 2019:\nNOTE 5 - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nThe following is a summary of property, plant, and equipment - at cost, less accumulated depreciation:\nThe Company did not record any depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nNOTE 6 - DEPOSIT\nThe following is a summary of deposit:\nNOTE 7 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity\u2019s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels:\n\u25cf Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\n\u25cf Level 2 - Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\n\u25cf Level 3 - Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use.\nLiabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized as follows:\nThe following table summarizes the activity for financial instruments at fair value using Level 3 inputs for 2019 and 2018:\nThe recorded value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value at December 31, 2018 and 2017 based upon the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms, and the remaining short-term period outstanding, the carrying value of notes payable other than PIK notes approximate fair value. The estimated fair value of the PIK Notes Payable was approximately $0 and $13,863,433 at December 31, 2019 and 2018 (Level 3), respectively.\nFor the Company's warrant and PIK note derivative liabilities, Level 3 fair value hierarchy was estimated using a Monte Carlo Model using the following assumptions:\nNOTE 8 - NOTES PAYABLE\nNotes payable at December 31, 2019 and 2018 consist of the following:\n(a) On November 13, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with a related party. Per the terms of the agreement, the Company has borrowed $250,000 against an expected annual renewal payment for an exploration license it granted as part of an Exploration Agreement with Option to Purchase entered into with Continental Minerals Claims, Inc. in December 2017, in exchange for $200,000 in cash. The loan was unsecured and paid off in February 2020. There was no interest rate specified.\n(b) On October 2018, the Company signed two notes payable with interest rate of 4.89% with an insurance company for liability insurance, payable in 10 monthly installment which started on November 17, 2018\n(c) On October 2019, the Company signed a note payable with interest rate of 4.89% with an insurance company for liability insurance, payable in 10 monthly installment payments which started on November 17, 2019\n(d) On October 2019, the Company signed a note payable with interest rate of 7.04% with an insurance company for liability insurance, payable in 10 monthly installment which started on November 17, 2019\nDuring the 2019 and 2018, the Company's interest payments totalled $12,982 and $9,156, respectively.\nNOTE 9 - CONVERTIBLE DEBT (PIK NOTES)\nThe Company raised $23 million of financing through the issuance of two series of Paid-In-Kind (\u201cPIK\u201d)-Election Convertible Notes in 2013 (\u201cSeries 2023 Notes\u201d) and 2014 (\u201cSeries A Notes\u201d). The original terms of the Series A Notes included among other things: (i) a maturity of November 1, 2018 with an option to extend to November 1, 2019, (ii) a stated interest rate of 10% paid semi-annually and (iii) a conversion price of $0.90, adjusted downward based on an anti-dilution provision. The original terms of the Series 2023 Notes included among other things: (i) a maturity of August 1, 2023, (ii) a stated interest rate of 10% paid semi-annually and (iii) a conversion price of $1.40, adjusted downward based on an anti-dilution provision. On December 14, 2017, an amendment agreement, entered into between the Company and the holders of the Series A Notes and Series 2023 Notes, went into effect. The agreement resulted in changes to certain terms of the Series A and Series 2023 Notes. The key terms of the Series A and Series 2023 Notes, as amended, are highlighted in the table below:\nKey Terms\nSeries 2023 Notes\nSeries A Notes\nInception Date\n08/01/2013\n11/03/2014\nCash Received\n$10,500,000\n$12,500,000\nPrincipal (Initial Liability)\n$10,500,000\n$19,848,486\nMaturity (Term)\nMatures on August 1, 2023, but convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at the discretion of the holder or by the Company based on the market price of the Company\u2019s stock;\nMatures on May 1, 2023 but extends to August 1, 2023 if the Series 2023 Notes are still outstanding. Convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at the discretion of the holder or by the Company based on the market price of the Company\u2019s stock;\nExercise Price\n$0.59, adjusted downward based on anti-dilution provisions/downround protection\n$0.40, adjusted downward based on anti-dilution provisions/down-round protection;\nStated Interest\n10% per annum through December 14, 2017, 3% per annum thereafter, due semiannually;\n10% per annum through December 14, 2017, 3% per annum thereafter, due semiannually;\nDerivative Liability\n$2,055,000 established at inception due to the existence of down-round protection; revalued every quarter using Monte Carlo model\n$9,212,285 established at inception due to existence of down-round protection; revalued every quarter using a Monte Carlo model\nAs of December 31, 2019, the liability components of the PIK Notes on the Company\u2019s balance sheet are listed in the following table:\nAs of December 31, 2018, the liability components of the PIK Notes on the Company\u2019s balance sheet are listed in the following table:\nSeries A Notes (Amended)\nOn November 3, 2014 (\u201cIssue Date\u201d), the Company issued, in a private placement pursuant to investment agreements, $19,848,486 principal amount of 10% PIK-Election Convertible Notes due 2018 (\"Series A Notes\") in exchange for $12,500,000 in cash and the cancellation of previously-issued warrants held by one investor.\nThe original terms of the Series A Notes included among other things: (i) a maturity of November 1, 2018 with an option to extend to November 1, 2019, (ii) a stated interest rate of 10% paid semi-annually and (iii) a conversion price of $0.90, adjusted downward based on an anti-dilution provision. The original terms of both the Series A notes and Series 2023 Notes can be as exhibits to Forms 8-K filed on November 5, 2014.\nBelow are key amended terms of the Series A Notes:\n\u25cf Maturity: May 1, 2023 but extends to August 1, 2023 if the Series 2023 Notes are outstanding.\n\u25cf Exercise Price: $0.40 per share and will be adjusted from time to time pursuant anti-dilution provisions.\n\u25cf Stated Interest: 10% payable semiannually in arrears through December 14, 2017, 3% payable semiannually in arrears thereafter.\n\u25cf Liquidated Damages: The Company is required to pay the noteholders 1% of the principal amount of the Series A Notes if a Registration statement is not filed and effective within 90 days of the inception date (and further damages for every 30 days thereafter).\n\u25cf The number of shares issuable under the Notes may be affected by the anti-dilution provisions of the Notes. The antidilution provisions adjust the Exercise Price of the Notes in the event of stock dividends and splits, issuance below the market price of the common stock, issuances below the conversion price of the Notes, pro rata distribution of assets, rights plans, tender offers, and exchange offers.\nThe entire principal amount of the Series A Notes and accrued interest thereon shall be mandatorily converted into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock if (i) the Volume Weighted Average Price (\u201cVWAP\u201d) of the thirty (30) preceding trading days is at or greater than $1.00 or the VWAP of the ten (10) preceding trading days is at or greater than $1.40; (ii) the closing market price of the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock is at or greater than $1.00; (iii) all outstanding amounts under each Series 2023 Note or replacement financing, if any, shall have been converted into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock pursuant to the terms of such Series 2023 Note or the replacement financing, if any, on or prior to the date on which a notice of mandatory conversion is received; and (iv) either (x) a registration statement is effective and available for the resale of all of the shares into which the Series A Notes convert on the date on which the Series A notes are mandatorily converted and each of the five (5) trading days prior to the date of mandatory conversion and on the date of mandatory conversion the holders of the Series A Notes are not restricted from selling or distributing any shares into which the Series A Notes convert pursuant to the provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement or (y) the holders Series A Notes may sell all such shares into which the Series A Notes convert immediately under Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nThese Series A Notes were not issued with the intent of effectively hedging any future cash flow, fair value of any asset, liability, or any net investment in a foreign operation. In addition to the customary anti-dilution provisions the notes contain a down-round provision whereby the conversion price would be adjusted downward in the event that additional shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or securities exercisable, convertible or exchangeable for the Company\u2019s common stock were issued for cash consideration (e.g. a capital raise) at a price less than the conversion price. Therefore, the estimated fair value of the conversion feature of $9,212,285 (based on observable inputs using a Monte Carlo model) was bifurcated from the Series A Notes and accounted for as a separate derivative liability, which resulted in a corresponding amount of debt discount on the Series A Notes. In addition, an additional debt discount of $7,348,486 was recorded as a result of the difference between the $12,500,000 of cash received and the $19,848,486 of principal on the Series A Notes. This combined debt discount of $16,560,771 is being amortized using the effective interest method over the 9-year term of the Notes as Interest Expense, while the PIK Note Derivative is carried at fair value (using a Monte Carlo model) until the Notes are converted or otherwise extinguished. Any changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company issued additional Series A PIK Notes in lieu of interest payments of $833,305 and paid down $233,986 of PIK notes, increasing the Series A Notes Payable gross carrying value to $28,265,165 as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $5,433,052 impact of accounting change and amortized $786,502 of debt discount and deferred financing cost relating to the Series A Notes Payable, increasing the Series A Notes Payable net carrying value to 26,800,854 as of December 31, 2019.\nAt December 31, 2018, the fair value of the Series A Note Derivative was estimated to be $1,526,857, which includes the value of the derivative related to the additional PIK Notes issued in May and November 2018 for the semi-annual interest payments due. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company issued additional Series A PIK Notes in lieu of interest payments of $713,197, increasing the Series A Notes Payable gross carrying value to $27,622,913 as of December 31, 2018. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company amortized $709,173 of debt discount and deferred financing cost relating to the Series A Notes Payable, increasing the Series A Notes Payable net carrying value to 20,097,227 as of December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the covenants of the Series A Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Samlyn Offshore Master Fund, Ltd. and Samlyn Onshore Fund, LP owned $9,284,784 and $4,955,681, respectively, of principal of the Series A Notes. Samlyn Offshore Master Fund, Ltd. and Samlyn Onshore Fund, LP are managed by Samlyn Capital, LLC. As of December 31, 2019, Michael Barry, a director of the Company, was the General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer of Samlyn Capital, LLC.\nAs of December 31, 2019, The IBS Turnaround Fund, LP, The IBS Turnaround (QP) (A Limited Partnership) and The IBS Opportunity Fund, Ltd. owned $1,347,172, $2,705,266 and $262,852, respectively, of principal of the Series A Notes. The IBS Turnaround Fund, LP, The IBS Turnaround (QP) (A Limited Partnership) and The IBS Opportunity Fund, Ltd. are managed by IBS Capital, LLC. At December 31, 2019, IBS Capital, LLC owned 13.6% of the shares of the common stock of the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2019, M. Kingdon Offshore Master Fund, LP, a fund managed by Kingdon Capital Management, LLC, owned $4,315,293 of principal of the Series A Notes. As of December 31, 2019, Michael Pohly, a director of the Company, was an employee of Kingdon Capital Management, LLC.\nSeries 2023 Notes (Amended)\nIn August 2013, the Company received $10,500,000 of financing through the private placement of 10% mandatory convertible Notes due 2023 (\"Series 2023 Notes\"). The principal amount of the Notes is due on maturity. The Company can elect to pay semi-annual interest on the Series 2023 Notes with additional PIK Notes containing the same terms as the Series 2023 Notes, except interest will accrue from issuance of such notes. The Company can also elect to pay interest in cash.\nThe Series 2023 Notes convert into the Company\u2019s common stock at a conversion price of $0.59 per share, which is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments; the holders may convert the Series 2023 Notes at any time. The Series 2023 Notes are mandatorily convertible after one year when the weighted average trading price of a share of the common stock for the preceding ten trading days is in excess of the conversion price. The Series 2023 Notes contain customary representations and warranties and several covenants. The proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes. No broker was used and no commission was paid in connection with the sale of the Series 2023 Notes.\nThese Series 2023 Notes were not issued with the intent of effectively hedging any future cash flow, fair value of any asset, liability or any net investment in a foreign operation. In addition to the customary anti-dilution provisions the notes contain a down-round provision whereby the conversion price would be adjusted downward in the event that additional shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or securities exercisable, convertible or exchangeable for the Company\u2019s common stock were issued for cash consideration (e.g. a capital raise) at a price less than the conversion price. Therefore, the estimated fair value of the conversion feature of $2,055,000 (based on observable inputs using a Monte Carlo model) was bifurcated from the Series 2023 Notes and accounted for as a separate derivative liability, which resulted in a corresponding amount of debt discount on the Series 2023 Notes. The debt discount is being amortized using the effective interest method over the 10-year term of the Series 2023 Notes as Interest Expense, while the PIK Note Derivative is carried at fair value (using a Monte Carlo model) until the Series 2023 Notes are converted or otherwise extinguished. Any changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company issued additional Series 2023 PIK Notes in lieu of interest payments of $640,693 and paid down $133,936 of PIK notes, increasing the Series 2023 Notes Payable gross carrying value to $16,901,445 as of December 31, 2019.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company issued additional Series 2023 PIK Notes in lieu of interest payments of $303,967, increasing the Series 2023 Notes Payable gross carrying value to $16,394,688 as of December 31, 2018. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company amortized $399,064 of debt discount and deferred financing cost relating to the Series 2023 Notes Payable, increasing the Series 2023 Notes Payable net carrying value to $14,939,093.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the covenants of the Series 2023 Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2019, M. Kingdon Offshore Master Fund, LP, a fund managed by Kingdon Capital Management, LLC, owned $4,024,152 of principal of the Series 2023 Notes. As of December 31, 2019, Michael Pohly, a director of the Company, was an employee of Kingdon Capital, Management, LLC.\nNOTE 10 - STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of noncumulative, non-voting, nonconvertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, no shares of preferred stock were outstanding.\nCommon Stock\nThe Company is authorized to issue 700,000,000 and 400,000,000 shares of common stock with a $0.001 par value per share at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, 175,513,549 shares were issued and outstanding.\nThere were no issuances in 2019.\nDuring 2018, the Company issued (i) 1,500,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.06 per share to a consultant for investor relation services to be performed, (ii) 17,375,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.04 per share, (iii) 3,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.05 per share, (iv) 1,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.10 per share, (v) 2,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.04 per share upon the exercise of a warrant to purchase shares of common stock, and (vi) 9,875,000 units, (one unit consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $0.15) at a price of $0.08 per unit.\nNOTE 11 - OPTIONS AND WARRANTS TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK\nOutstanding Stock Warrants\nA summary of the status and changes of the warrants issued for 2019 and 2018 is as follows:\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, the intrinsic values of the outstanding warrants were $0 and $20,688, respectively.\nA summary of the status of the warrants outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2019 is presented below:\nDuring June and July of 2018, the Company issued 9,875,000 units in exchange for $790,000 in cash proceeds. Each unit consists of one share of common stock and a 3-year warrant to purchase one share of common stock for $0.15.\nOutstanding Stock Options\nOn November 20, 2012, the shareholders of the Company approved the adoption of the Applied Minerals, Inc. 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (\u201cLTIP\u201d) and the Short-Term Incentive Plan (\u201cSTIP\u201d) and the performance criteria used in setting performance goals for awards intended to be performance-based. Under the LTIP, 8,900,000 shares are authorized for issuance. The STIP does not refer to a particular number of shares under the LTIP, but would use the shares authorized in the LTIP for issuance under the STIP. The CEO, the CFO, and named executive officers, and directors, among others are eligible to participate in the LTIP and STIP. Prior to the adoption of the LTIP and STIP, stock options were granted under individual arrangements between the Company and the grantees, and approved by the Board of Directors.\nOn December 7, 2016, the stockholders of the Company approved the 2016 Incentive Plan. The purpose of the 2016 Incentive Plan is to enhance the profitability and value of the Company for the benefit of its stockholders by enabling the Company to offer eligible employees, consultants, and non-employee directors incentive awards in order to attract, retain and reward such individuals and strengthen the mutuality of interests between such individuals and the Company\u2019s stockholders. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued or used for reference purposes under the 2016 Incentive Plan or with respect to which awards may be granted may not exceed 15,000,000 shares, which may be either (i) authorized and unissued Common Stock or (ii) Common Stock held in or acquired for the treasury of the Company.\nThe Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors has full authority to administer and interpret the 2016 Incentive Plan, to grant awards under the 2016 Incentive Plan, to determine the persons to whom awards will be granted, to determine the types of awards to be granted, to determine the terms and conditions of each award, to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by each award and to make all other determinations in connection with the 2016 Incentive Plan and the awards thereunder as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or desirable.\nThe fair value of each of the Company's stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatility is based on an average of historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury Bond on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award.\nThe significant assumptions relating to the valuation of the Company's options issued for 2019 and 2018 were as follows on a weighted average basis:\nA summary of the status and changes of the options granted under stock option plans and other agreements for 2019 and 2018 is as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company granted 7,683,334 options to purchase the Company\u2019s common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $0.04. Total grant date fair value was $223,903 of which $34,037 was unamortized compensation expense at December 31, 2019. Of the 7,683,334 options granted, the options vest as follows:\n(1) 450,000 options vested on 03/13/2019, 49,999 options vested on 04/13/2019, 49,999 options vested on 05/13/2019 and 50,002 options vested on 06/13/2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company granted 5,224,999 options to purchase the Company\u2019s common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $0.10. Of the 5,224,999 options granted, the options vest as follows:\n(1) 138,889 options vested on 04/30/2018 and 208,333 options vested on 07/01/2018.\n(2) 69,444 options vested on 06/01/2018 and 208,333 options vested on 07/01/2018.\nA summary of the status of the options outstanding at December 31, 2019 is presented below:\nCompensation expense of $249,116, and $533,089, has been recognized for the vested options for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of the outstanding options at December 31, 2019 was $0. At December 31, 2019, (i) $34,037 of unamortized compensation expense for time-based unvested options will be recognized over the next 1.31 years on a weighted average basis; and (ii) $223,105 of unamortized compensation expense for performance-based unvested options will be recognized as the performance targets are achieved.\nOn August 18, 2017, the Company\u2019s management was granted performance-based options to purchase 27.5 million shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at $0.06 per share. The options expire on August 18, 2027. On November 1, 2017, the first fifty percent (50%) of the performance-based options vested as management was able to (i) close the sale of an aggregate of $600,000 of units (consisting of a share of common stock of the Company and a warrant to buy 0.25 of a share of common stock of the Company) at $0.04 per unit and (ii) establish toll processing arrangements with two toll processors of halloysite that, in management\u2019s good faith belief, can process halloysite to the Company\u2019s specifications. An additional twenty-five percent (25%) of the performance-based options vested on January 18, 2018 when management generated $900,000 of additional cash proceeds through (i) the sale of common stock and (ii) the licensing of a right to explore the Dragon Mine property for certain precious metals. The vesting of the remaining 8.3%, 8.3% and 8.4% of the performance-based options occurs when (i) EBITDA is positive over a twelve-month period, (ii) EBITDA is at or greater than $2 million over a twelve-month period and (iii) EBITDA is at or greater than $4 million over a twelve-month period, respectively. At December 31, 2019, management, based on its financial expectations for 2020, did not consider the vesting of the remaining 25% of the option grant to be probable.\nNOTE 12 - PER SHARE DATA\nThe computation of basic earnings (loss) per share of common stock is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The computation of diluted earnings per common share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year plus the common stock equivalents that would arise from the exercise of stock options and warrants outstanding under the treasury method and the average market price per share during the year as well as the conversion of notes. At December 31, 2019, the weighted average shares outstanding excluded options to purchase 60,676,568 shares of common stock of the Company, warrants to purchase 26,688,373 shares of common stock of the Company and 99,698,391 shares of common stock of the Company issuable upon the conversion of notes payable because their effect would be anti-dilutive. At December 31, 2018, the weighted average shares outstanding excluded options to purchase 54,866,845 shares of common stock of the Company, warrants to purchase 26,688,373 shares of common stock of the Company and 97,539,420 shares of common stock of the Company issuable upon the conversion of notes payable because their effect would be anti-dilutive.\nNOTE 13 - INCOME TAXES\nThe Company calculates its deferred tax assets and liabilities using the federal tax rate of 21% and the effective state rate, net of federal benefits of 2.4%.\nThe tax effect of items that give rise to the deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nIn assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management determines whether it is more likely than not some, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the carryforward period as well as the period in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the reversal of taxable temporary differences, projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon historical losses and the possibility of continued losses over the periods that the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets and thus recorded a valuation allowance against the entire deferred tax asset balance. The valuation allowance increased by $842,145 in the year ended December 31, 2019 and decreased by $543,895 in the years ended December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards of $104,267,844 for federal income tax purposes and $73,599,750 for state and local income tax purposes. The federal net operating loss carry-forwards are available to be utilized against future taxable income through fiscal year 2039 and state loss carry-forwards expire from 2025 through 2039, subject to substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses in the event of an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. Utilization of the Company\u2019s federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards are subject to limitations as a result of these restrictions. No amounts were provided for unrecognized tax benefits attributable to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) provides for a limitation of the annual use of net operating losses following certain ownership changes (as defined by the Code) that could limit the Company\u2019s ability to utilize these carryforwards. At this time, the Company has not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code has occurred, or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since the Company\u2019s formation, due to the costs and complexities associated with such a study. The Company may have experienced various ownership changes, as defined by the Code, as a result of past financing transactions. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s ability to utilize the aforementioned carryforwards may be limited. Additionally, U.S. tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes. Therefore, the Company may not be able to take full advantage of these carryforwards for Federal or state income tax purposes.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduces the US corporate rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. The Company remeasured its deferred tax assets based upon the new 21% tax rate. As a result, the Company decreased its deferred tax assets by $15,181,980 with a corresponding adjustment to its valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nA reconciliation of the differences between the effective and statutory income tax rates is as follows:\nNOTE 14 - RELATED PARTIES\nOn November 13, 2019, Overlook Investments, LLC (\u201cOverlook\u201d), whose managing member is Ali Zamani, a director of the Company, loaned $200,000 to the Company under a loan agreement.

The Company paid a monthly rent of $6,000 through March 31, 2017 for the temporary office. On March 16, 2017, the Company entered into a 5-year lease agreement for permanent office space, base rent payment is approximately $9,000 per month, subject to annual adjustments.\nRent expense is calculated using the straight-line method based on total minimum lease payments over the initial term of the lease. Landlord tenant improvement allowances and rent expense exceeding actual rent payments are accounted for as deferred rent liability in the balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the respective leases.\nFuture minimum payments, by year and in the aggregate, under non-cancellable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more, consist of the following at December 31, 2019:\nNOTE 16 - SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS\nOn August 21, 2018 (\u201cEffective Date\u201d), Applied Minerals, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) and the purchaser of the Company\u2019s Surface Piles (\u201cPurchaser\u201d) entered into a Sale Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) for the sale of five Surface Piles for Initial Consideration of $4,546,145 and Additional Consideration of $1.00 per ton of Surface Pile material removed by Purchaser or its Agents from the Dragon Mine property. The Surface Piles include 4,546,145 tons of Surface Pile material, a mixture of halloysite, kaolinite and illite clays and a range of non-clay minerals.\nIt is solely the responsibility of Purchaser to remove the Surface Pile material from the Company\u2019s Dragon Mine Property. Purchaser will have 60 years to remove Surface Pile material. Thereafter, ownership of any Surface Pile material remaining on the Dragon Mine property will automatically revert to the Company. Purchaser may from time to time transfer to the Company any Surface Pile material that it decides will not be removed.\nPurchaser may bring on to Dragon Mine Property equipment and personnel reasonably acceptable to the Company for measuring, weighing, testing, crushing and otherwise processing, air-drying, commingling, storing, loading, removing documenting, or selling in connection with the Surface Piles\nThe Company may relocate a Surface Pile if the Purchaser agrees and such agreement will not be unreasonably withheld. Purchaser will not, and will cause its Agents not to, interfere in any material respect with the operations of the Company.\nNOTE 17 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nFirstFire Global Opportunities Fund LLC - Loan\nOn February 13, 2020, the Company entered loan agreement with, and issued a note to, Firstfire Global Opportunities Fund LLC (\u201cFirstFire\u201d). The note is in the principal amount of up to $250,000, including an original issue discount (\u201dOID\u201d) of 5%, so the maximum that can received by the Company is $237,500.\nThe principal amount is to be funded in tranches. The first tranche was in the principal amount of $125,000 (including the 5% OID), so that, after paying FirstFire\u2019s legal fees of $5,000, the Company received proceeds of $113,500. FirstFire may fund additional amounts up to $118,500 at such dates as it may choose.\nThe tranche or tranches will bear interest a 5% per annum on the principal amount of the tranches. If the Company exercises its right to prepay the respective tranche at any time within the initial 45 calendar days following the tranche funding date, the Company shall pay to FirstFire an amount equal to 105% multiplied by the principal amount then outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest and default interest, if any. If the prepayment is made from the 46th to the 90th day, the percentage is 110%. If the payment is made from the 91st day to the 180th day, the percentage is 120%; at any time from the 181st calendar day through the last trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the respective tranche, the percentage is 130%. The maturity date of each tranche is 12 months from the tranche funding date.\nThe note is convertible at any time in to the Company\u2019s Common Stock. The initial conversion price is $.02 per share. After one hundred eighty days after the date of the note, the conversion price will be the lower of (i) $.02 or (ii) 75% multiplied by the lowest traded price of the common stock during the 20 consecutive trading day period immediately preceding the date of the respective conversion;\nThe note is secured by a security agreement under which the Company granted a security interest to FirstFire in two pieces of equipment that are not being used in, and are not anticipated to be used in future, operations of the Company.\nIn connection with entering into the loan agreement with FirstFire, the Company issued 125,000 shares of common stock to FirstFire on February 19, 2020.\nExploration Agreement with Option to Purchase\nIn 2017, the Company and Continental Mineral Claims, Inc.

    "item_9A": "ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2019. Our principal executive and financial officers supervised and participated in the evaluation. Based on the evaluation, our principal executive and financial officers each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s forms and rules as of December 31, 2019.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u25cf pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n\u25cf provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n\u25cf provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2019 due to the material weaknesses defined below. In arriving at that conclusion, we considered the criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d) and we performed a complete assessment as outlined in Commission Guidance Regarding Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (\"SOX\").\nTo address these material weaknesses, management performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial statements included herein fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.\nIn performing our assessment, we identified the risks that most likely affect reliable financial reporting and are most likely to have a material impact on the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, documented each business process within the risk area, determined the control points related to the business process and tested the design and effectiveness of each control. In addition to process (transactional) level controls, we evaluated entity level controls to determine if compensating controls mitigated any process level risks. Entity level controls include a broad range of non-transactional activities including account reconciliations, management review of results, the company\u2019s Code of Conduct and Audit Committee review of practices and results.\nSEC Release 33-8809 defines \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrant\u2019s financial statement will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. SEC release 33-8809 defines \u201csignificant deficiency\u201d as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the registrant\u2019s financial reporting.\nManagement has identified the following material weaknesses, which have caused management to conclude that as of December 31, 2019, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective at the reasonable assurance level:\n\u25cf Insufficient segregation of duties, oversight of work performed and lack of compensating controls in our finance and accounting functions due to limited personnel; and\n\u25cf We lack a sufficient process for periodic financial reporting, including timely preparation and review of financial reports and statements.\nNotwithstanding the existence of these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the management believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.\nInternal Control Remediation Efforts\nManagement has taken the following steps to remedy the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting:\n1. During the third calendar quarter of 2018, management engaged an experienced accounting consultant to (i) assist with ongoing GAAP and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission compliance requirements (ii) and develop a sufficient process for periodic financial reporting, including timely preparation and review of financial reports and statements. Additionally, management may further expand the accounting and finance function by hiring appropriate staff to resolve this material weakness in 2020 if the necessary resources become available.\n2. The Company\u2019s accounting consultant will assist management with strengthening its internal controls in 2020.\nThe annual report does not include an attestation report of the independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permits us to provide only management's report in this annual report.",

We believe the successful marketing of such applications will generate material profits for the Company, which, in turn, will create significant value for its stockholders. To realize this objective, the Company must attract and retain individuals, including our Named Executive Officers (\u201cNamed Executive Officers\u201d or \u201cNEOs\u201d) (Messrs. Zeitoun, Carney and Gleeson), who possess the skill sets and experience needed to effectively develop and implement the business strategies and corporate governance infrastructure necessary to achieve commercial success.\nAccordingly, compensation for the Named Executive Officers is designed to:\n\u25cf Attract, motivate, and retain qualified Named Executive Officers;\n\u25cf Incentivize the Named Executive Officers to lead the Company to profitable operations and to increase stockholder value;\n\u25cf Assure that over time a significant part of NEO compensation is linked to the Company\u2019s long-term stock price performance, which aligns the Named Executive Officers\u2019 financial interests with those of the Company\u2019s stockholders\n\u25cf Motivate the Named Executive Officers to develop long-term careers at the Company and contribute to its future prospects; and\n\u25cf Permit the Named Executive Officers to remain focused on the development of the Company\u2019s business in the midst of actual or potential change-in-control transactions.\nThe Company does not have a policy concerning minimum ownership or hedging by officers of Company securities.\nCompensation of Mr. Zeitoun\nMr. Zeitoun has been president and CEO of the Company since 2009.\n2017 Compensation\nOn March 8, 2017, the Board determined that Mr. Zeitoun\u2019s 2017 compensation is as follows: salary - $350,000; cash receipts bonus - 4% of monthly gross cash receipts, up to a maximum bonus of $150,000; revenue bonus - $100,000 if GAAP revenue exceeds $6 million; cash flow bonus - $100,000 if the Company is cash flow positive for 2017.

Depending on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of exercise of options that are not performance-based, the compensation of certain executive officers in future years may be in excess of $1 million for purposes of Section 162(m). The Compensation Committee reserves the right to pay compensation that may be non-deductible to the Company if it determines that it would be in the best interests of the Company.\nTax and Accounting Treatment of Options\nWe are required to recognize in our financial statements compensation cost arising from the issuance of stock options. GAAP requires that such that compensation cost is determined using fair value principles (we use the Black-Scholes method of valuation) and is recognized in our financial statements over the requisite service period of an instrument. However, the tax deduction is only recorded on our tax return when the option is exercised. The tax benefit received at exercise and recognized in our tax return is generally equal to the intrinsic value of the option on the date of exercise.\nCompensation of Policies and Practices as they relate to Risk Management\nThe Company does not believe that its compensation policies and practices (cash compensation and at-the-market or above-market five- and ten-year options without or without performance standards and with or without vesting schedules) are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company as they relate to risk management practices and risk-taking incentives.\nCompensation Committee Report\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management.
