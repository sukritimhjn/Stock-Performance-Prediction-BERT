    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nEarthstone Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cEarthstone\u201d and together with our consolidated subsidiaries, the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or similar terms), is a growth-oriented independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition and development of oil and gas reserves through activities that include the acquisition, drilling and development of undeveloped leases, asset and corporate acquisitions and mergers. Our operations are all in the upstream segment of the oil and natural gas industry and all our properties are onshore in the United States. At present, our assets are located in the Midland Basin of west Texas and the Eagle Ford Trend of south Texas.\nOur primary focus is concentrated in the Midland Basin of west Texas, a high oil and liquids rich resource basin which provides us with multiple horizontal targets with proven production results, long-lived reserves and historically high drilling success rates.\nIRM Acquisition\nOn January 7, 2021, Earthstone, Earthstone Energy Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company (\u201cEEH\u201d and collectively with Earthstone, the \u201cBuyer\u201d), Independence Resources Holdings, LLC (\u201cIndependence\u201d), and Independence Resources Manager, LLC (\u201cIndependence Manager\u201d and collectively with Independence, the \u201cSeller\u201d) consummated the transactions contemplated in the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated December 17, 2020 (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) that was previously reported on Form 8-K. The Seller was unaffiliated with the Company. At the closing of the Purchase Agreement, among other things, EEH acquired (the \u201cIRM Acquisition\u201d) all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Independence and Independence Manager (collectively, the \u201cAcquired Entities\u201d) for aggregate consideration consisting of the following: (i) an aggregate amount of cash from EEH equal to approximately $131.2 million (the \u201cCash Consideration\u201d) and (ii) 12,719,594 shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock, $0.001 par value per share (\u201cClass A Common Stock\u201d), issued to Independence (such shares, the \u201cAcquisition Shares,\u201d and such issuance, the \u201cStock Issuance\u201d). As a result of the Stock Issuance, Earthstone is no longer considered a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE rules.\nAmendment to Credit Agreement - In preparation for the IRM Acquisition, on December 17, 2020, Earthstone, EEH, as Borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d), as Administrative Agent, the guarantors party thereto, and the lenders party thereto (the \u201cLenders\u201d) entered into an amendment (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to the credit agreement dated November 21, 2019, by and among EEH, as Borrower, Earthstone, as Parent, Wells Fargo, as Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank, BOKF, NA dba Bank of Texas, as Issuing Bank with respect to Existing Letters of Credit, Royal Bank of Canada, as Syndication Agent, Truist Bank, as successor by merger to SunTrust Bank, as Documentation Agent, and the Lenders party thereto (together with all amendments or other modifications, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). The Amendment was effective upon the closing of the IRM Acquisition on January 7, 2021. Among other things, the Amendment (i) joined certain financial institutions as additional lenders, increased the borrowing base from $240.0 million to $360.0 million, (ii) increased the interest rate on outstanding borrowings; and (iii) adjusted some of the financial covenants.\nRegistration Rights Agreement - On January 7, 2021, in connection with the closing of the Purchase Agreement, Earthstone and Independence entered into a registration rights agreement (the \u201cRegistration Rights Agreement\u201d) relating to the IRM Acquisition Shares and the shares of Class A Common Stock that Independence acquired from EnCap Investments L.P. and its affiliates (\u201cEnCap\u201d) on January 7, 2021 (collectively, the \u201cRegistrable Securities\u201d). The Registration Rights Agreement provides that Earthstone will file a registration statement to permit the public resale of the Registrable Securities. Earthstone shall cause the registration statement to be continuously effective from its effective date until all of the Registrable Securities have been disposed of in the manner set forth in the registration statement or under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, until the distribution of the Class A Common Stock does not require registration under the Securities Act, or until there are no longer any Registrable Securities outstanding.\nVoting Agreement - On January 7, 2021, in connection with the closing of the Purchase Agreement, Warburg Pincus Private Equity (E&P) XI - A, L.P. (\u201cWPXI-A\u201d), Warburg Pincus XI (E&P) Partners - A, L.P. (\u201cWPPXI\u201d), WP IRH Holdings, L.P. (\u201cWPIRH\u201d), Warburg Pincus XI (E&P) Partners - B IRH, LLC (\u201cWPXI-B\u201d), Warburg Pincus Energy (E&P)-A, LP (\u201cWPE-A\u201d), Warburg Pincus Energy (E&P) Partners-A, LP (\u201cWPEP-A\u201d), Warburg Pincus Energy (E&P) Partners-B IRH, LLC (\u201cWPEP-B\u201d), WP Energy Partners IRH Holdings, L.P. (\u201cWPEPIRH\u201d), and WP Energy IRH Holdings, L.P. (\u201cWPEIRH\u201d and collectively with WPXI-A, WPPXI, WPIRH, WPXI-B, WPE-A, WPEP-A, WPEP-B and WPEPIRH, the \u201cWarburg Parties\u201d), EnCap and Earthstone entered into a voting agreement (the \u201cVoting Agreement\u201d) containing provisions by which the Warburg Parties will have the right to appoint one director to the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) of Earthstone. The Warburg Parties\u2019 right to appoint one director will terminate when the Warburg Parties, in the aggregate, no longer own: (i) 8% of the outstanding Class A Common Stock; or (ii) 10% or more of the outstanding Class A Common Stock as a result of a sale by the\nWarburg Parties. The Warburg Parties nominated David S. Habachy and the Board appointed Mr. Habachy as a Class II director who will hold office until Earthstone\u2019s annual meeting of stockholders in 2023.\nLock-Up Agreement - In connection with the closing of the Purchase Agreement, on January 7, 2021, Earthstone entered into a Lock-up Agreement (the \u201cLock-up Agreement\u201d) with the Warburg Parties, pursuant to which the Warburg Parties are restricted for a period of 120 days (the \u201cLock-up Period\u201d) after January 7, 2021 from offering, pledging, selling, contracting to sell, selling any option or contract to purchase, purchasing any option or contract to sell, granting any option, right or warrant to purchase, lending or otherwise transferring or disposing of any shares of Class A Common Stock or any other class of Earthstone\u2019s capital stock (collectively, \u201cCapital Stock\u201d), or enter into any swap or other agreement, arrangement or transaction that transfers to another any of the economic consequence of ownership of any Capital Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for any Capital Stock. The foregoing restrictions will not apply to certain other transfers customarily excepted and any shares of Class A Common Stock acquired by the Warburg Parties in the open market after January 7, 2021.\nOur Properties\nWith 407 potential gross horizontal drilling locations (262 operated / 145 non-operated) in the Midland Basin as of December 31, 2020, we are focused on developmental drilling and completion operations in the area. As a result of the IRM Acquisition, we added 43,400 additional net acres with 750 gross / 738.5 net operated producing wells and 2 gross / 1.0 net non-operated wells. The acquisition includes 4,900 net core acres located in Midland and Ector counties with 70 additional gross drilling locations. The remaining acreage is located primarily in Irion and Sterling Counties.\nWe continue to pursue acreage trades or bolt-on acreage acquisitions in the Midland Basin with the intent of increasing our operated acreage and drilling inventory, drilling and completing longer laterals and realizing greater operating efficiencies.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 27,900 net acres in the core of the Midland Basin that are highly contiguous on a project-by-project basis which allow us to drill multi-well pads. Of this acreage, 78% is operated and 22% is non-operated. We hold an approximate 93% working interest in our operated acreage and an approximate 40% working interest in our non-operated acreage. Our operated acreage in the Midland Basin is primarily located in Reagan, Upton and Midland counties which includes 88 gross / 77.3 net producing wells. Our non-operated acreage in the Midland Basin is located primarily in Howard, Glasscock, Martin, Midland and Reagan counties which includes 140 gross / 48.4 net producing wells.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 12,500 net leasehold acres in the Eagle Ford Trend, primarily in the crude oil window in Fayette, Gonzales and Karnes counties which include 115 gross / 51.4 net operated producing wells and 6 gross / 1.1 net non-operated wells.\nAs operator, we manage and are able to directly influence development and production of our operated properties. Independent contractors engaged by us provide all the equipment and personnel associated with drilling and completion activities. We employ petroleum engineers, geologists and land professionals who work on improving operating cost, production rates and reserves. Our producing properties have reasonably predictable production profiles and cash flows, subject to commodity price and cost fluctuations. Our status as an operator has allowed us to pursue the development of undeveloped acreage, further develop existing properties and generate new projects.\nAs is common in our industry, we selectively participate in drilling and developmental activities in non-operated properties. Decisions to participate in non-operated properties are dependent upon the technical and economic nature of the projects and the operating expertise and financial standing of the operators.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were approximately 78,875 MBOE based on the reserve report prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (\u201cCG&A\u201d), our independent petroleum engineers. Based on this report, at December 31, 2020, our estimated proved reserve quantities were approximately 51% oil, 24% natural gas and 26% NGLs with 49% of those reserves classified as proved developed.\nAs a result of the IRM Acquisition, we added an estimated 16,300 MBoe of proved developed producing reserves which were approximately 60% oil, 18% natural gas and 23% NGLs.\nOur Business Strategy\nWe believe that the current industry environment will result in more consolidations; however, execution may be hampered by the high debt levels of many producers. We continue to pursue value-accretive and scale-enhancing consolidation opportunities, as we believe we are in a position to operate effectively despite the volatility in commodity prices experienced over the past several years. We are focusing our attention on acquisition and corporate merger opportunities that would increase the scale of our operations, without materially altering our debt metrics in relation to our cash flows and capital. In addition, we believe the current industry environment presents unique opportunities to acquire distressed assets or corporations that will be financially distressed in the near future which should provide us the potential for further consolidation based on our financial strength. At the same time, we will seek to block up acreage in the Midland Basin that would allow for longer horizontal laterals and should\ntherefore provide for higher economic returns. In summary, we believe we are well qualified to be a consolidator which would increase the scale of our operations and add value to our shareholders.\nOur current business strategy is to focus on the economic development of our existing acreage, increase our acreage and horizontal well locations in the Midland Basin and increase stockholder value through the following:\n\u2022developing our acreage and profitably growing our production while seeking to achieve Free Cash Flow (defined in \u201cNon-GAAP Measures\u201d below);\n\u2022operating our properties efficiently and continuing to improve our operating margins;\n\u2022deploying capital efficiently by drilling multi-well pads, reducing drilling times and increasing completions per day;\n\u2022operating our assets in a safe and environmentally sensitive manner;\n\u2022continuing to hedge commodity prices as opportunities arise;\n\u2022pursuing value-accretive acquisition and corporate merger opportunities, which could increase the scale of our operations;\n\u2022maximizing operating margins and corporate level cash flows by minimizing operating and overhead costs;\n\u2022expanding our acreage positions and drilling inventory in our primary areas of interest through acquisitions and farm-in opportunities, with an emphasis on operated positions;\n\u2022blocking up acreage to allow for longer horizontal lateral drilling locations which provide higher economic returns; and\n\u2022maintaining a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility.\nOur Strengths\nWe believe that the following strengths are beneficial in achieving our business goals:\n\u2022extensive horizontal development potential in one of the most oil rich basins of the United States;\n\u2022experienced management team with substantial technical and operational expertise;\n\u2022ability to attract technical personnel with experience in our core area of operations;\n\u2022history of successful acquisition and merger transactions;\n\u2022operating control over the majority of our production and development activities;\n\u2022financial discipline;\n\u2022conservative balance sheet;\n\u2022commitment to cost efficient operations; and\n\u2022a management team that is well known and respected throughout the industry.\n2020 Highlights\nThe following are highlights of our 2020 activities compared to activity in 2019:\n\u2022Signed Purchase and Sale Agreement on the IRM Acquisition on December 17, 2020 which was closed on January 7, 2021 (see below)\n\u2022Full year 2020 average daily sales volumes of 15,276 Boepd exceeded our production goals and increased 14%\n\u2022Reduced outstanding long-term debt in 2020 by 32%, from $170.0 million to $115.0 million\n\u2022Realized $56.0 million from our hedge positions thereby mitigating commodity price volatility\n\u2022Strong balance sheet and liquidity position with $125.0 million of undrawn capacity on a $240.0 million senior revolving credit facility and a cash balance of $1.5 million as of December 31, 2020\n\u2022Advanced our business strategy despite the impact of COVID-19 on commodity prices and the industry.\nCommodity Price Recovery\nAs oil prices have recovered recently from their 2020 lows, we are preparing to resume drilling operations with the deployment of a rig late in the first quarter of 2021 and we expect to spend $90-$100 million in total capital expenditures during 2021 based on our current 2021 capital spending plan.\nOfficer Appointments\nEffective April 1, 2020, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Frank A. Lodzinski, was appointed Executive Chairman and our President, Mr. Robert J. Anderson, was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer.\nCOVID-19\nDespite the recent recoveries in commodity prices, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity markets. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions, business closures and the institution of quarantining and other restrictions on movement in many communities. As a result, there has been significant volatility in demand for and prices of oil and natural gas. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, is uncertain and depends on various factors, including how the pandemic and measures taken in response to its impact on demand for oil and natural gas, the availability of personnel, equipment and services critical to our ability to operate our properties and the impact of potential governmental restrictions on travel, transports and operations. There is uncertainty around the extent and duration of disruption, including any resurgence, and we expect that the longer the duration of any such disruption, the greater the adverse impact may be on our business. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health crisis adversely impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, its impact on the U.S. and world economies, the U.S. capital markets and market conditions, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nOperational Status\nAs a producer of oil, natural gas and NGLs, we are recognized as an essential business under various federal, state and local regulations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have continued to operate as permitted under these regulations while taking mitigation efforts and steps to protect the health and safety of our employees. The safety of our employees is paramount, and we have emphasized the respective guidelines to support our mitigation efforts. Our field personnel are performing their job responsibilities and practicing mitigation guidelines with no issues to date. Our non-field personnel had been working remotely, using information technology in which we previously invested. More recently, the majority of our non-field personal have been working at our corporate offices while adhering to local county and CDC guidelines. Upon returning to work at our corporate offices, we implemented protocols that consist of required mask wearing zones, use of installed sanitization equipment in various locations and practice social distancing in gathering areas such as conference rooms. We have managed and conducted both field and non-field functions effectively thus far, including our day-to-day operations, our accounting and financial reporting systems and our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to focus on the health and safety of our employees in conformity with the applicable jurisdictional mitigation guidelines.\nCommodity Market Challenges\nThe significant decline in commodity prices resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted producers of oil, natural gas and NGLs in the U.S. and elsewhere. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in global consumer demand contraction and the ensuing supply/demand imbalance has had a disruptive impact on oil and gas exploration and production. In April 2020, WTI crude oil prices averaged $16.55/Bbl and briefly fell below $0/Bbl, closing at -$36.98/Bbl on April 20, 2020. In response, management began to voluntarily shut-in as much production as was feasible in an effort to preserve reserves to sell in the future. As prices returned to economic levels, management returned those wells to production as quickly as possible, beginning in late May and early June. Management estimates that total net production was curtailed by approximately 60% in May, with minimal volumes curtailed in April and June. Since June 2020, we have returned to operating at full production capacity as oil prices have continued to recover. Additionally, based on the current recovered commodity price levels, we plan to commence a drilling program late in the first quarter of 2021.\nOperational/Financial Challenges\nIt is difficult to model and predict how our operations and financial status may change as a result of COVID-19. In our industry, any forecast, plans and changes to operations and financial status are a function of commodity prices. If oil prices decline due to a resurgence of COVID-19, we believe we can continue to operate and produce our properties at a minimum in a cash flow neutral position for the next 12 months. We will have to manage the possibility of well shut-ins, both voluntary and involuntary,\nto preserve our assets and cash flows. A significant driver in the future may be the financial institutions\u2019 view on commodity prices with respect to borrowing base redeterminations. If a resurgence of COVID-19 triggers additional volatility in our business or global economies, our borrowing base, currently set at $360 million, could be reduced. Significant reductions in the borrowing base under our Credit Agreement could create a borrowing base deficiency depending on or loans then outstanding which may lead to a default. We believe global, as well as national, mitigation efforts currently being implemented to fight COVID-19 have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on commodity prices and may continue to present significant challenges to our industry.\nThe effects of COVID-19, including a substantial decrease in economic activity, have contributed to significant credit, debt and equity market volatility. Similar to other producers in our business, we experienced volatility in the price of our Class A common stock.\nImpairments\nWe recorded impairments in the first quarter of 2020 resulting, in part, from the effects of COVID-19 (in thousands):\n(1)Impairments in unproved properties resulting from acreage deemed expired (not planned to be renewed)\nGovernment Assistance\nAlthough management explored all assistance available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), the Company was not eligible for any of the programs therein with the exception of the deferral of employment tax deposits and payments which management has currently not elected to pursue.\nEmployee Reduction Measures\nIn June 2020, management completed a workforce reduction effort that reduced the number of full-time employees from 68 to 60 by month end, resulting in over a 10% decrease in aggregate salaries and wages. Severance related costs associated with these reduction measures resulted in operating expenses of $0.4 million in June 2020. At this time, management has no future plans for further workforce reductions; however, if adverse industry conditions occur, further employee reduction measures may be necessary.\nOrganizational Structure\nEarthstone is the sole managing member of EEH, with a controlling interest in EEH. Earthstone, together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lynden Energy Corp., a corporation organized under the laws of British Columbia (\u201cLynden Corp\u201d), and Lynden Corp\u2019s wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary, Lynden USA, Inc. (\u201cLynden US\u201d) and also a member of EEH, consolidates the financial results of EEH and records a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements representing the economic interests of EEH\u2019s members other than Earthstone and Lynden US. Additionally, on January 7, 2021, upon closing of the IRM Acquisition, IRM became a wholly owned subsidiary of EEH.\nOperational Risks\nOil and natural gas exploitation, development and production involve a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. There is no assurance that we will acquire, discover or produce additional oil and natural gas in commercial quantities. Oil and natural gas operations also involve the risk that well fires, blowouts, equipment failure, human error and other events may cause accidental leakage or spills of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids or drilling fluids into the environment or cause significant injury to persons or property. In such event, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the satisfaction of which could substantially reduce our available cash and possibly result in loss of oil and natural gas properties. Such hazards may also cause damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and pipeline or other processing facilities.\nAs is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we do not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by\ninsurance could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows. For further discussion of these risks see",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of our business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially affect our business. When considering an investment in our shares of Class A Common Stock, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in this report under \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and other information included and incorporated by reference into this report.\nOur business and operations have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe spread of COVID-19 caused, and is continuing to cause, severe disruptions in the worldwide and U.S. economies, including contributing to the reduced global and domestic demand for oil and natural gas, which has had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, since the beginning of January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the United States. The continued spread of COVID-19 could also negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business. If COVID-19 continues to spread or the response to contain or mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic through the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, including the vaccines recently approved by the FDA for emergency use in the U.S., is unsuccessful, we could continue to experience material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Due to the rapid development and fluidity of this situation, we cannot make any prediction as to the ultimate material adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices are volatile. Their prices at times since 2014 have adversely affected, and in the future may adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our\ncapital expenditure obligations and financial commitments. Volatile and lower prices may also negatively impact our stock price.\nThe prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production heavily influence our revenues, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. These hydrocarbons are commodities, and therefore, their prices may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the market for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids has been volatile. For example, during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2020, the WTI spot price for oil declined from a high of $107.95 per Bbl in June 2014 to -$36.98 per Bbl in April 2020. The Henry Hub spot price for natural gas has declined from a high of $8.15 per MMBtu in February 2014 to a low of $1.33 per MMBtu in September 2020. During 2020, WTI spot prices ranged from -$36.98 to $63.27 per Bbl and the Henry Hub spot price of natural gas ranged from $1.33 to $3.14 per MMBtu. Likewise, natural gas liquids, which are made up of ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline, each of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics, have experienced significant declines in realized prices since the fall of 2014. The prices we receive for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce and our production levels depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022worldwide, regional and local economic and financial conditions impacting supply and demand;\n\u2022the level of global exploration, development and production;\n\u2022the level of global supplies, in particular due to supply growth from the United States;\n\u2022the price and quantity of oil, natural gas and NGLs imports to and exports from the U.S.;\n\u2022political conditions in or affecting other oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids producing countries and regions, including the current conflicts in the Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe;\n\u2022actions of the OPEC and state-controlled oil companies relating to production and price controls;\n\u2022the extent to which U.S. shale producers become swing producers adding or subtracting to the world supply totals;\n\u2022future regulations prohibiting or restricting our ability to apply hydraulic fracturing to our wells;\n\u2022current and future regulations regarding well spacing;\n\u2022prevailing prices and pricing differentials on local oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids price indices in the areas in which we operate;\n\u2022localized and global supply and demand fundamentals and transportation, gathering and processing availability;\n\u2022weather conditions;\n\u2022technological advances affecting fuel economy, energy supply and energy consumption;\n\u2022the effect of energy conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements and increasing demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas;\n\u2022global or national health concerns, including health epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of 2020;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u2022domestic, local and foreign governmental regulation and taxes.\nLower oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices have and may continue to reduce our cash flows and borrowing capacity. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our hydrocarbon reserves as existing reserves are depleted. A decrease in prices could render development projects and producing properties uneconomic, potentially resulting in a loss of mineral leases. Low commodity prices have, at times, caused significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, and may cause us to make further downward adjustments in the future. Furthermore, our borrowing capacity could be significantly affected by decreased prices. A sustained decline in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices could adversely impact our borrowing base in future borrowing base redeterminations, which could trigger repayment obligations under the Credit Agreement to the extent our outstanding borrowings exceed the redetermined borrowing base and could otherwise materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures. In addition, lower oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids gas prices may cause a decline in the market price of our shares.\nAs a result of low prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, we may be required to take significant future write-downs of the financial carrying values of our properties.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our proved and unproved properties for possible impairment. Based on prevailing commodity prices and specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to significantly write-down the financial carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties, which constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are recorded.\nA write-down could occur when oil and natural gas prices are low or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves, if operating costs or development costs increase over prior estimates, or if exploratory drilling is unsuccessful.\nThe capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, on a field-by-field basis, may exceed the estimated future net cash flows of that field. If so, we would record impairment charges to reduce the capitalized costs of such field to our estimate of the field\u2019s fair market value. Unproved properties are evaluated at the lower of cost or fair market value. These types of charges will reduce our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity and could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe periodically assess our properties for impairment based on future estimates of proved and non-proved reserves, oil and natural gas prices, production rates and operating, development and reclamation costs based on operating budget forecasts. Once incurred, an impairment charge cannot be reversed at a later date even if price increases of oil and/or natural gas occur and in the event of increases in the quantity of our estimated proved reserves.\nIf oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices fall below current levels for an extended period of time and all other factors remain equal, we may incur impairment charges in the future. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which they are recorded. See Note 7. Oil and Natural Gas Properties to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information.\nAny significant reduction in our borrowing base under our Credit Agreement may negatively impact our liquidity and, consequently, our ability to fund our operations, including capital expenditures, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under our Credit Agreement or any other obligation if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination.\nAvailability under the Credit Agreement is currently subject to a borrowing base of $360.0 million, as increased with the closing of the IRM Acquisition on January 7, 2021. The borrowing base is subject to scheduled semiannual redeterminations (on or about May 1 and November 1), as well as other lender-elective borrowing base redeterminations. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Reductions in estimates of our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves may result in a reduction in our borrowing base under the Credit Agreement (if prices are kept constant). Reductions in our borrowing base under the Credit Agreement could also arise from other factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022lower commodity prices or production;\n\u2022increased leverage ratios;\n\u2022inability to drill or unfavorable drilling results;\n\u2022changes in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserve engineering techniques;\n\u2022increased operating and/or capital costs;\n\u2022the lenders\u2019 inability to agree to an adequate borrowing base; or\n\u2022adverse changes in the lenders\u2019 practices (including required regulatory changes) regarding estimation of reserves.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $115.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement with a borrowing base of $240 million. When adjusted to include the IRM Acquisition on January 7, 2021, we had $260 million of long-term debt outstanding under the Credit Agreement with a borrowing base of $360 million. We may make further borrowings under the Credit Agreement in the future. Any significant reduction in our borrowing base under the Credit Agreement as a result of borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise will negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Further, if the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination, we could be required to repay the excess.\nUnless we replace our reserves, our production and estimated reserves will decline, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs are generally characterized by declining production rates that may vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Decline rates are typically greatest early in the productive life of a well, particularly horizontal wells. Estimates of the decline rate of an oil or natural gas well are inherently imprecise and may be less precise with respect to new or emerging oil and natural gas formations with limited production histories than for more developed formations with established production histories. Our production levels and the reserves that we currently expect to recover from our wells will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change under other circumstances. Thus, our estimated future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flows and results of operations are highly dependent upon our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current properties and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional\nreserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, our cash flows and the value of our reserves may decrease, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves involve assumptions and any material inaccuracies in these assumptions will materially affect the quantities and the value of those reserves.\nThis report contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves. These estimates are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by SEC regulations relating to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex and requires significant decisions, complex analyses and assumptions in evaluating available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise.\nOur actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from those estimated. Any significant variance will likely materially affect the estimated quantities and the estimated value of our reserves. In addition, we may later adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development activities, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nQuantities of estimated proved reserves are based on economic conditions in existence during the period of assessment. Changes to oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in the markets for these commodities may shorten the economic lives of certain fields because it may become uneconomical to produce all recoverable reserves in such fields, which may reduce proved reserves estimates.\nNegative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves have the effect of increasing the rates of depletion on the affected properties, which decrease earnings or result in losses through higher depletion expense. These revisions, as well as revisions in the assumptions of future estimated cash flows of those reserves, may also trigger impairment losses on certain properties, which may result in non-cash charges to earnings. See Note 7. Oil and Natural Gas Properties to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nThe development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately 51% of our estimated proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. The development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves of 40,577 MBOE will require an estimated $285.1 million of development capital over the next five years. Development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. The future development of our proved undeveloped reserves is dependent on successful drilling and completion results, future commodity prices, costs and economic assumptions that align with our internal forecasts, as well as access to liquidity sources, such as the capital markets, the Credit Agreement and derivative contracts. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the PV-10 value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. Moreover, under the SEC regulations, we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill or have a development plan to drill wells within a prescribed five-year period. The estimated reserve data assumes that we will make specified capital expenditures to timely develop our reserves. The estimates of these oil and natural gas reserves and the costs associated with development of these reserves have been prepared in accordance with SEC regulations; however, actual capital expenditures may vary from estimated capital expenditures, development may not occur as scheduled and actual results may not be as estimated.\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves may not be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves set forth in this report is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements in effect at December 31, 2020 and 2019, we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas unweighted arithmetic average prices without giving effect to derivative transactions and costs in effect as of the date of the estimate, holding prices and costs constant through the life of the properties. Actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as: the actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas; the actual cost of development and production expenditures; the amount and timing of actual production; and changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and incurring expenses related to developing and producing oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general. As a corporation, we are treated as a taxable entity for statutory income tax purposes and our future income taxes will be dependent on our future taxable income. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the estimates included in this report which could have a material effect on the value of our estimated reserves.\nOur development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.\nWe have acquired significant amounts of unproved property in order to further our development efforts and expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future. Development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered. We acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our results of operations over time. However, we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our leaseholds. Additionally, we cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed, that wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells.\nProperties we acquire may not produce as projected and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities.\nAcquiring oil and natural gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics, including recoverable reserves, development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain. In connection with the assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties, but such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems. In the course of our due diligence, we may not inspect every well or pipeline. We cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems, such as pipe corrosion, when an inspection is made. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to our purchase of a property. We may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of properties in addition to the risk that they may not perform in accordance with our expectations. If properties we acquire do not produce as projected or have liabilities we were unable to identify, we could experience a decline in our reserves and production, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture drilling and completion activities associated with identified drilling locations may be adversely affected by factors that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling and completion, which in certain instances could prevent production prior to the expiration date of mineral leases for such locations.\nAlthough our management team has identified numerous potential drilling locations as a part of our long-range planning related to future drilling activities on our existing acreage, our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors, which are beyond our control, including, the availability and cost of capital, oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, drilling and production costs, the availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results (including the impact of increased horizontal drilling density and longer laterals), lease expirations, gathering systems, marketing and pipeline transportation constraints, regulatory permits and approvals and other factors. In addition, we may alter the spacing between our anticipated drilling locations, which could impact the number of our drilling locations, the number of wells that we drill, and the volumes of oil and gas we ultimately recover. As such, our actual drilling and completion activities, may materially differ from those presently anticipated. Accordingly, it is uncertain to what degree that these potential drilling locations will be developed or if we will be able to produce significant oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids from these or any other potential drilling locations. Unless production is established, in accordance with the terms of mineral leases that are associated with these locations, such leases could expire.\nMany of our properties are in areas that may have been partially depleted or drained by offset wells and certain of our wells may be adversely affected by actions we or other operators may take when drilling, completing, or operating wells that we or they own.\nMany of our properties are in reservoirs that may have already been partially depleted or drained by earlier offset drilling. The owners of leasehold interests adjoining any of our properties could take actions, such as drilling and completing additional wells, which could adversely affect our operations. When a new well is completed and produced, the pressure differential in the vicinity of the well causes the migration of reservoir fluids toward the new wellbore (and potentially away from existing wellbores). As a result, the drilling and production of these potential locations by us or other operators could cause depletion of our proved reserves and may inhibit our ability to further develop our proved reserves. In addition, completion operations and\nother activities conducted on adjacent or nearby wells by us or other operators could cause production from our wells to be shut in for indefinite periods of time, could result in increased lease operating expenses and could adversely affect the production and reserves from our wells after they re-commence production. We have no control over the operations or activities of offsetting operators.\nMulti-well pad drilling may result in volatility in our operating results.\nWe utilize multi-well pad drilling where practical. Because wells drilled on a pad are not brought into production until all wells on the pad are drilled and completed and the drilling rig is moved from the location, multi-well pad drilling delays the commencement of production from a given pad, which may cause volatility in our operating results. In addition, problems affecting one pad could adversely affect production from all wells on such pad. As a result, multi-well pad drilling can cause delays in the scheduled commencement of production or interruptions in ongoing production.\nThe unavailability or high cost of equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services used to drill and complete wells could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nThe demand for drilling rigs, pipe and other equipment and supplies, as well as for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry, can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. Our operations are concentrated in areas in which activity has increased rapidly, and as a result, demand for such drilling rigs, equipment and personnel, as well as access to transportation, processing and refining facilities in these areas, has increased, as have the costs for those items. In addition, to the extent our suppliers source their products or raw materials from foreign markets, the cost of such equipment could be impacted if the United States imposes tariffs on imported goods from countries where these goods are produced. Such shortages or cost increases could delay or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur acquisition, development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could limit growth or lead to a decline in our reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas reserves. We expect to fund our 2021 capital expenditures with cash on hand, cash generated by operations, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and possibly through additional capital market transactions. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, oil and natural gas prices, actual drilling results, the availability of high-quality drilling rigs and other services and equipment and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. A reduction in commodity prices from current levels may result in a decrease in our actual capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production.\nOur cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including: our proved reserves; the level of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells; the prices at which our production is sold; our ability to acquire, locate and produce reserves; and our ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under the Credit Agreement decrease as a result of low oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations and growth at current levels. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our properties, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production and would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA negative shift in investor sentiment towards the oil and gas industry could adversely affect our ability to raise equity and debt capital.\nMuch of the investor community has developed negative sentiment towards investing in our industry. Recent equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices. Some investors, including certain public and private fund management firms, pension funds, university endowments and family foundations, have stated policies to reduce or eliminate their investments in the oil and gas sector based on environmental, social and governance considerations. Certain other stakeholders have pressured private equity firms and commercial and investment banks to stop funding oil and gas projects. Such developments have resulted and could continue to result in downward pressure on the stock prices of oil and gas companies, including ours. This may also result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects, further impacting our future financial results.\nWe have incremental cash inflows and outflows as a result of our hedging activities. To the extent we are unable to obtain future hedges at attractive prices or our derivative activities are not effective, our cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nIn an effort to achieve more predictable cash flows and reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we often enter into derivative instrument contracts for a portion of our oil and natural gas production, including swaps, collars, puts and basis swaps. We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities, measured at fair value, and recognize changes in the fair value of derivatives in current earnings. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly and our results of operations may be significantly and adversely affected because of changes in the fair market value of our derivative instruments. As our derivative instrument contracts expire, there is no assurance that we will be able to replace them comparably.\nDerivative instruments can expose us to the risk of financial loss in varying circumstances, including, but not limited to, when: production is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments; the counter-party to the derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations; there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price stated in the derivative instrument contract and actual prices received; or there are issues with regard to legal enforceability of such instruments.\nFor additional information regarding our hedging activities, please see Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 6. Derivative Financial Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive, and our small size puts us at a disadvantage in competing for resources.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive particularly in the Permian Basin of Texas where our properties and operations are concentrated. We compete with major integrated and larger independent oil and natural gas companies in seeking to acquire desirable oil and natural gas properties and leases and for the equipment and services required to develop and operate properties. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources that are substantially greater than ours, which makes acquisitions of acreage or producing properties at economic prices difficult. Significant competition also exists in attracting and retaining technical personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers, landmen and other specialists, as well as financial and administrative personnel hence we may be at a competitive disadvantage to companies with larger financial resources than ours.\nFailure to complete additional acquisitions could limit our potential growth.\nOur future success is highly dependent on our ability to acquire and develop mineral leases and oil and gas properties with economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves. Without continued successful acquisition, of economic development projects, our current estimated oil and natural gas reserves will decline due to continued production activities. Acquiring additional oil and natural gas properties, or businesses that own or operate such properties is an important component of our business strategy. If we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, management may be unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with the seller, finance the acquisition or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. Our limited access to financial resources compared to larger, better capitalized companies may limit our ability to make future acquisitions. If we are unable to complete suitable acquisitions, it may be more difficult to replace and increase our reserves, and an inability to replace our reserves may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks, including the risk that we will discover unanticipated liabilities or other problems associated with the acquired business or property.\nIn assessing potential acquisitions, we consider information available in the public domain and information provided by the seller. In the event publicly available data is limited, then, by necessity, we may rely to a large extent on information that may only be available from the seller, particularly with respect to drilling and completion costs and practices, geological, geophysical and petrophysical data, detailed production data on existing wells, and other technical and cost data not available in the public domain. Accordingly, the review and evaluation of businesses or properties to be acquired may not uncover all existing or relevant data, obligations or actual or contingent liabilities that could adversely impact any business or property to be acquired and, hence, could adversely affect us as a result of the acquisition. These issues may be material and could include, among other things, unexpected environmental liabilities, title defects, unpaid royalties, taxes or other liabilities. If we acquire properties on an \u201cas-is\u201d basis, we may have limited or no remedies against the seller with respect to these types of problems.\nThe success of any acquisition that we complete will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to accurately assess the reserves associated with the acquired properties, assumptions related to future oil and natural gas prices and operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors. These assessments are often inexact and subjective. As a result,\nwe may not recover the purchase price of a property from the sale of production from the property or recognize an acceptable return from such sales or operations.\nOur ability to achieve the benefits that we expect from an acquisition will also depend on our ability to efficiently integrate the acquired operations. Management may be required to dedicate significant time and effort to the integration process, which could divert its attention from other business opportunities and concerns. The challenges involved in the integration process may include retaining key employees and maintaining employee morale, addressing differences in business cultures, processes and systems and developing internal expertise regarding acquired properties.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations, including our drilling operations.\nOil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities are subject to numerous significant operating risks, including the possibility of:\n\u2022unanticipated, abnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022significant mechanical difficulties, such as stuck drilling and service tools and casing collapses;\n\u2022blowouts, fires and explosions;\n\u2022personal injuries and death;\n\u2022uninsured or underinsured losses; and\n\u2022environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater contamination.\nAny of these operating hazards could cause damage to properties, reduced cash flows, serious injuries, fatalities, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages, which could expose us to significant liabilities. We may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe nature of our business and assets exposes us to significant compliance costs and liabilities.\nOur operations involving the exploration, development and production of hydrocarbons are subject to stringent federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment as well as protection of the environment, operational safety, and related employee health and safety matters. Laws and regulations applicable to us include those relating but not limited to the following: land use restrictions; delivery of our oil and natural gas to market; drilling bonds and other financial responsibility requirements; spacing of wells; air emissions; property unitization and pooling; habitat and endangered species protection, reclamation and remediation; containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials; drilling permits; use of saltwater injection wells, which affects the disposal of saltwater from our wells; safety precautions; prevention of oil spills; operational reporting; and taxation and royalties.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is a significant cost of doing business. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory and remedial liabilities; the issuance of injunctions that may restrict, inhibit or prohibit our operations; and claims of damages to property or persons.\nSome environmental laws and regulations impose strict liability, which means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability for clean-up costs and other damages as a result of conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of prior operators of properties we acquired or of other third parties. Similarly, some environmental laws and regulations impose joint and several liability, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of a particular reclamation or other obligation, and potentially the entire obligation, where other parties were involved in the activity giving rise to the liability. In addition, we may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations, for example by installing and maintaining pollution control devices. Similarly, our actual plugging and abandonment obligations may be more than our estimates. It is not possible for us to estimate reliably the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters, but we estimate that they will be material. Environmental risks are generally not fully insurable.\nFederal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nWe engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with many of the wells for which we are the operator. Federal, state and local governments have been adopting or considering restrictions on or prohibitions of fracturing in areas where we currently conduct operations, or in the future plan to conduct operations.\nConsequently, we could be subject to additional levels of regulation, operational delays or increased operating costs and could have additional regulatory burdens imposed upon us that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.\nFrom time to time, for example, legislation has been proposed in Congress to amend the SDWA to require federal permitting of hydraulic fracturing and the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Further, the EPA completed a study finding that hydraulic fracturing could potentially harm drinking water resources under adverse circumstances such as injection directly into groundwater or into production wells lacking mechanical integrity. Other governmental reviews have also been recently conducted or are under way that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the rules will be implemented, and what impact they would have on our operations. Further, legislation to amend the SDWA to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing (except when diesel fuels are used) from the definition of \u201cunderground injection\u201d and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed in recent sessions of Congress. Several states and local jurisdictions in which we operate also have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids.\nMore recently, federal and state governments have begun investigating whether the disposal of produced water into underground injection wells has caused increased seismic activity in certain areas. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report regarding the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances such as water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability, surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water, injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources, discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters, and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. The results of these studies could lead federal and state governments and agencies to develop and implement additional regulations. In addition, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment (\u201cCWT\u201d) facilities) accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities.\nThe proliferation of regulations may limit our ability to operate. If the use of hydraulic fracturing is limited, prohibited or subjected to further regulation, these requirements could delay or effectively prevent the extraction of oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nExtreme weather conditions could adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling, completion and production activities in the areas where we operate.\nOur exploitation and development activities and equipment could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes or freezing temperatures, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity from regional power outages or lost or damaged facilities and equipment. Such extreme weather conditions could also impact access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance and repairs and the availability of and our access to, necessary third-party services, such as gathering, processing, compression and transportation services. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay or temporarily halt our operations and materially increase our operation and capital costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of greenhouse gases, investor pressure concerning climate-related disclosures, and lawsuits could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and gas we produce as well as reductions in the availability of capital.\nStudies have found that emission of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d), impact the earth\u2019s climate. The U.S. Congress and various states have been evaluating, and in some cases implementing, climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of GHGs. On January 20, 2021, President Biden\u2019s first day in office, he signed an executive order on climate action and reconvened an interagency working group to establish interim and final social costs of three GHGs: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane. Carbon dioxide is released during the combustion of fossil fuels, including oil, natural gas, and NGLs, and methane is a primary component of natural gas. The Biden administration stated it will use updated social cost figures to inform federal regulations and major agency actions and to justify\naggressive climate action as the United States moves toward a \u201c100% clean energy\u201d economy with net-zero GHG emissions. These actions could result in increased costs and reduced demand for our products.\nIn December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to the warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act that establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\u201cPSD\u201d) and Title V permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD and/or Title V permits under EPA\u2019s GHG Tailoring Rule for their GHG emissions also may be required to meet \u201cBest Available Control Technology\u201d standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain oil and natural gas production facilities on an annual basis, which includes certain of our operations. In recent proposed rulemaking, the EPA is widening the scope of annual GHG reporting to include not only activities associated with completion and workover of natural gas wells with hydraulic fracturing and activities associated with oil and natural gas production operations, but also completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing, gathering and boosting systems, and transmission pipelines.\nWhile the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs in recent years, it has not adopted any significant GHG legislation. This is expected to change with the Democratic Party now in control of the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the office of the President. In the absence of federal GHG legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged, aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions through cap-and-trade programs, which typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting GHGs. Any future laws or regulations that require reporting of, or otherwise limit emissions of, GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to both develop and implement new practices aimed at reducing GHG emissions, such as emissions control technologies, and monitor and report GHG emissions associated with our operations, any of which could increase our operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce. At this time, it is not possible to quantify the impact of such future laws and regulations on our business.\nSeveral policy makers and political candidates have made, or expressed support for, a variety of more comprehensive proposals, such as cap-and-trade or carbon tax programs, as well as the more sweeping \u201cgreen new deal\u201d resolutions the U.S. Congress introduced in early 2019. As generally proposed, the \u201cgreen new deal\u201d includes (i) a cap-and-trade program capping overall GHG emissions on an economy-wide basis and requiring major sources of GHG emissions or major fuel producers to acquire and surrender emission allowances and (ii) a carbon tax, which would impose taxes based on emissions from our operations and the downstream uses of our products. The \u201cgreen new deal\u201d calls for a 10-year national mobilization effort to, among other things, transition 100% of the U.S. power demand to zero-emission sources and overhaul the U.S. transportation systems so that GHG emissions are eliminated as much as is technologically feasible. The enactment of any such legislation would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are sold in a limited number of geographic markets so an oversupply in any of those areas could have a material negative effect on the price we receive.\nOur oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are primarily sold in two geographic markets in Texas which each have a fixed amount of storage and processing capacity. As a result, if such markets become oversupplied with oil, natural gas and/or natural gas liquids, it could have a material negative effect on the prices we receive for our products and therefore an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. There is a risk that refining capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast may be insufficient to refine all of the light sweet crude oil being produced in the United States. If light sweet crude oil production remains at current levels or continues to increase, demand for our light crude oil production could result in widening price discounts to the world crude prices and potential shut-in of production due to a lack of sufficient markets despite the lift on prior restrictions on the exporting of oil and natural gas.\nPotential future legislation or the imposition of new or increased taxes or fees may generally affect the taxation of oil and natural gas exploration and development companies and may adversely affect our operations and cash flows.\nIn past years, federal and state level legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to tax laws, including to certain key federal and state income tax provisions currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and development companies. For example, President Biden has set forth several tax proposals that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws. Such proposals include, but are not limited to, (i) an increase in the U.S. income tax rate applicable to corporations and (ii) the elimination of tax subsidies for fossil fuels. Congress could consider some or all of these proposals in connection with tax reform to be undertaken by the Biden administration. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. Additionally, states in which we operate or own assets may impose new or increased taxes or fees on oil and natural gas extraction. The passage of any\nlegislation as a result of these proposals and other similar changes in federal income tax laws or the imposition of new or increased taxes or fees on oil and natural gas extraction could adversely affect our operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability, use and disposal of water. New legislation and regulatory initiatives or restrictions relating to water disposal wells could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWater is an essential component of our drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Wastewaters from our operations typically are disposed of via underground injection. Some studies have linked earthquakes in certain areas to underground injection, which is leading to greater public scrutiny of disposal wells. Any new environmental initiatives or regulations that restrict injection of fluids, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and gas, or that limit the withdrawal, storage or use of surface water or ground water necessary for hydraulic fracturing of our wells, could increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or cessation of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, and all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAny change to government regulation or administrative practices may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and our profitability.\nOil and natural gas operations are subject to substantial regulation under federal, state and local laws relating to the exploration for, and the development, upgrading, marketing, pricing, taxation, and transportation of, oil and natural gas and related products and other associated matters. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities of oil and natural gas exploration and development operations could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that income tax laws, royalty regulations and government programs related to our oil and natural gas properties and the oil and natural gas industry generally will not be changed in a manner which may adversely affect our progress or cause delays.\nPermits, leases, licenses, and approvals are required from a variety of regulatory authorities at various stages of exploration and development. There can be no assurance that the various government permits, leases, licenses and approvals sought will be granted in respect of our activities or, if granted, will not be cancelled or will be renewed upon expiration. There is no assurance that such permits, leases, licenses, and approvals will not contain terms and provisions which may adversely affect our exploration and development activities.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon gathering systems, transportation facilities and processing facilities that we do not own or control. If these facilities or systems are unavailable, our oil and natural gas production can be interrupted and our revenues reduced.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production is dependent upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems, transportation and processing facilities owned by third parties. In general, we will not control these facilities, and our access to them may be limited or denied due to circumstances beyond our control. A significant disruption in the availability of these facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market the hydrocarbons we produce and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations. In some cases, our ability to deliver to market our hydrocarbons is dependent upon coordination among third parties that own transportation and processing facilities we use, and any inability or unwillingness of those parties to coordinate efficiently could also interrupt our operations. The lack of availability or the lack of capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the curtailment of production or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans. This is more likely in areas with recent increased production, such as our Permian Basin area where we have significant development activities. These are risks for which we generally will not maintain insurance.\nWe operate or participate in oil and natural gas leases with third parties who may not be able to fulfill their commitments to our projects.\nIn some cases, we operate but own less than 100% of the working interest in the oil and natural gas leases on which we conduct operations, and other parties own the remaining portion of the working interest. Financial risks are inherent in any operation where the cost of drilling, equipping, completing and operating wells is shared by more than one person. We could be held liable for joint activity obligations of other working interest owners, such as nonpayment of costs and liabilities arising from the actions of other working interest owners. In addition, declines in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices may increase the likelihood that some of these working interest owners, particularly those that are smaller and less established, are not able to fulfill their joint activity obligations. A partner may be unable or unwilling to pay its share of project costs, and, in some cases, a partner may declare bankruptcy. In the event any of our project partners do not pay their share of such costs, we would likely\nhave to pay those costs, and we may be unsuccessful in any efforts to recover these costs from our partners, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nUse of debt financing may adversely affect our strategy.\nWe may use debt to fund a portion of our future acquisition, development and/or operating activities. Any temporary or sustained inability to service or repay such debt will likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to access financing markets and pursue our operating strategies, as well as impair our ability to respond to adverse economic changes in oil and natural gas markets and the economy in general.\nBecause we cannot control activities on properties we do not operate, we cannot directly control the timing of exploitation. If we are unable to fund required capital expenditures with respect to non-operated properties, our interests in those properties may be reduced or forfeited.\nOur ability to exercise influence over operations and costs for the properties we do not operate is limited. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital with respect to acquisition, exploration or development activities. The success and timing of development, exploitation or exploration activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors that may be outside our control, including but not limited to: the timing and amount of capital expenditures; the operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources; the approval of other participants in drilling wells; and the selection of technology.\nWhere we are not the majority owner or operator of a particular oil and natural gas project, we may have no control over the timing or amount of capital expenditures associated with the project. If we are not willing or able to fund required capital expenditures relating to a project when required by the majority owner(s) or operator, our interests in the project may be reduced or forfeited. Also, we could be responsible for plugging and abandonment costs, as well as other liabilities in excess of our proportionate interest in the property.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. We are dependent on digital technologies including information systems and related infrastructure, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees, business partners, and stockholders, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves as well as other activities related to our business.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for the purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites.\nOur technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period of time. In particular, our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, data, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Costs for insurance may also increase as a result of security threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations.\nThe loss or unavailability of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend greatly on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees to manage our operations. The loss or unavailability of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nWe are a holding company and the sole manager of EEH. Our only material asset is our equity interest in EEH and, accordingly, we are dependent upon distributions from EEH to cover our corporate and other overhead expenses and pay taxes.\nWe are a holding company and the sole manager of EEH. We have no material assets other than our equity interest in EEH. We have no independent means of generating revenue. We expect EEH to reimburse us for our corporate and other overhead expenses, and to the extent EEH has available cash, we intend to cause EEH to make distributions to the holders of membership units of EEH (\u201cEEH Units\u201d), including us, in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and non-U.S. tax liabilities of Earthstone, Lynden Corp and Lynden US, if any, at assumed tax rates. We will likely be limited, however, in our ability to cause EEH and its subsidiaries to make these and other distributions due to the restrictions under the Credit Agreement. To the extent that we need funds, and EEH or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of their financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nOur principal stockholders hold substantial voting power of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.\nHolders of Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share (\u201cClass B Common Stock\u201d), will vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Subsequent to the IRM Acquisition, EnCap and Warburg Parties may be deemed to beneficially own approximately 49.4% and 17.0%, respectively, of our voting interests and, along with their affiliates, could limit the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions they may deem to be in the best interests of our Company or delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management.\nAs long as EnCap and certain of its affiliates continue to control a significant amount of our outstanding voting securities, they will have the authority to exercise significant influence over management and all matters requiring stockholder approval, regardless of whether or not other stockholders believe that a potential transaction is in their own best interests. Also, in any of these matters, the interests of our management team may differ or conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, EnCap and its affiliates may, from time to time, acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business, as well as businesses that are significant existing or potential acquisition candidates or industry partners. EnCap and its affiliates may acquire or seek to acquire assets that we seek to acquire and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us or may be more expensive for us to pursue. Moreover, this concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with a controlling stockholder.\nBold Holdings (controlled by EnCap) and its permitted transferees have the right to exchange their EEH Units and shares of Class B Common Stock for our Class A Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the EEH LLC Agreement.\nAs of March 1, 2021, there were approximately 34.4 million shares of our Class A Common Stock that are issuable upon redemption or exchange of EEH Units and shares of Class B Common Stock that are held by Bold Holdings, a fund managed by EnCap, or its permitted transferees. Pursuant to the First Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of EEH (the \u201cEEH LLC Agreement\u201d), subject to certain restrictions therein, holders of EEH Units and our Class B Common Stock are entitled to exchange such EEH Units and shares of Class B Common Stock for shares of our Class A Common Stock at any time. If so exercised, EnCap would own more than 50% of our Class A Common Stock and would therefore have the ability to control our Company.\nFuture sales of our Class A Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe may sell additional shares of Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into shares of our Class A Common Stock in subsequent offerings. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into Class A Common Stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A Common Stock will have on the market price of our Class A Common Stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A Common Stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe have no plans to pay dividends on our Class A Common Stock. Stockholders may not receive funds without selling their shares.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A Common Stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. In addition, the Credit Agreement does not allow EEH to\nmake any significant payments to us, which makes it highly unlikely that we would be in a position to pay cash dividends on our Class A Common Stock.\nOur Board of Directors can, without stockholder approval, cause preferred stock to be issued on terms that could adversely affect our common stockholders.\nUnder our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Board is authorized to cause Earthstone to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which none are issued and outstanding as of the date of this report. Also, our Board, without stockholder approval, may determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares. If the Board causes shares of preferred stock to be issued, the rights of the holders of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock would likely be subordinate to those of preferred holders and therefore could be adversely affected. The Board\u2019s ability to determine the terms of preferred stock and to cause its issuance, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock or otherwise seek to acquire us. Shares of preferred stock issued by us could include voting rights, or even super voting rights, which could shift the ability to control Earthstone to the holders of the preferred stock. Preferred stock could also have conversion rights into shares of Class A Common Stock at a discount to the market price of the Class A Common Stock which could negatively affect the market for our Class A Common Stock. In addition, preferred stock could have preference in the event of liquidation of Earthstone, which means that the holders of preferred stock would be entitled to receive the net assets of Earthstone distributed in liquidation before the Class A common stockholders receive any distribution of the liquidated assets. We have no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.\nThe price of our Class A Common Stock may fluctuate significantly, which could negatively affect us and holders of our Class A Common Stock.\nThe trading price of our Class A Common Stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Adverse events including changes in production volumes, worldwide demand and prices for crude oil and natural gas, regulatory developments, and changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance could negatively impact the market price of our Class A Common Stock. General market conditions, including the level of, and fluctuations in, the trading prices of stocks generally could also have a similar negative impact. The stock markets regularly experience price and volume volatility that affects many companies\u2019 stock prices without regard to the operating performance of those companies. Volatility of this type may affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions could make a third-party acquisition difficult.\nOur Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides for a classified board of directors, with each member serving a three-year term. Provisions in our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us without the approval of our Board. In addition, the Delaware corporate statutes also contain certain provisions that could make an acquisition by a third-party more difficult.\nOur stockholders may act by unilateral written consent.\nUnder our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of our stockholders, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Thus, consents of this type can be effected without the participation or input of minority stockholders.",

    "item_2": "Item 2. Properties\nSummary of Oil and Gas Properties\nMidland Basin\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 27,900 net acres in the core of the Midland Basin that are highly contiguous on a project-by-project basis which allow us to drill multi-well pads. Of this acreage, 78% is operated and 22% is non-operated. We hold an approximate 93% working interest in our operated acreage and an approximate 40% working interest in our non-operated acreage. Our operated acreage in the Midland Basin, consisting of approximately 21,800 net acres, is primarily located\nin Reagan, Upton and Midland counties. Our non-operated acreage in the Midland Basin, consisting of approximately 6,100 net acres, is located primarily in Howard, Glasscock, Martin, Midland and Reagan counties.\nWith 407 potential gross operated horizontal drilling locations, largely de-risked, the vast majority of which are in various benches of the Wolfcamp and the Spraberry formations, in the Midland Basin as of December 31, 2020, we are focused on developmental drilling and completion operations in the area. As a result of the IRM Acquisition, we added 43,400 additional net acres in the Midland Basin of which 99% is operated and 1% is non-operated, as well as adding 70 potential gross horizontal drilling locations on core acreage located in Midland and Ector counties. We continue to pursue acreage trades or bolt-on acreage acquisitions in the Midland Basin with the intent of increasing our operated acreage and drilling inventory, drilling and completing longer laterals and realizing greater operating efficiencies.\nDuring 2020, we completed and began producing from 9 gross / 9 net operated wells and 15 gross / 3.5 net non-operated wells. We exited 2020 with 5 gross / 3.7 net wells that were drilled and awaiting completion. We recently completed these wells and anticipate turning them to sales before the end of March 2021.\nWe recently commenced our 2021 drilling program with the deployment of a rig in Midland County. After drilling on a three-well pad in the Hamman project, we expect to drill a four-well pad on the recently acquired IRM Spanish Pearl project. We anticipate moving the rig to Upton County and drilling 10-11 wells. Consistent with previously released guidance, we anticipate drilling 16 gross / 14.8 net operated wells and spudding an additional 5 gross / 3.7 net operated wells during 2021.\nEagle Ford Trend\nAs of December 31, 2020, we held approximately 26,400 gross (12,500 net) leasehold acres primarily in Fayette, Gonzales and Karnes counties, Texas. The acreage is located in the crude oil window of the Eagle Ford shale trend of south Texas and is prospective for the Eagle Ford, Austin Chalk and Upper Eagle Ford formations. Our working interests range from approximately 12% to 67%.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we operated 103 gross Eagle Ford wells and 12 gross Austin Chalk wells and had non-operated interests in five gross producing Eagle Ford wells and one gross producing Austin Chalk wells. We have identified a total of 26 potential gross Eagle Ford drilling locations in this acreage. In addition, because our acreage position is prospective for the Austin Chalk and Upper Eagle Ford formations, we may have additional future economic locations. The majority of our acreage is covered by an approximately 173 square mile 3-D seismic survey.\nOil and Natural Gas Reserves\nAs of December 31, 2020, all of our oil and natural gas reserves were located in the state of Texas. We expect to further develop these properties through additional drilling and completion operations. Our reserve estimates have been prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (\u201cCG&A\u201d), an independent petroleum engineering firm. The scope and results of CG&A\u2019s procedures are summarized in a letter which is included as an exhibit to this report. For further information on estimated reserves, including information on estimated future net cash flows and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, please refer to the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities (Unaudited) in Part II, Item 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our estimated proved reserves totaled 78,875 MBOE and had a PV-10 value of approximately $473.4 million (reconciled in \u201cNon-GAAP Measures\u201d below) and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of approximately $460.9 million, all of which relate to our properties in Texas. We incurred approximately $66.8 million in capital expenditures, primarily drilling and completion costs, during 2020. We expect to further develop our properties through additional drilling.\n2020 Activity in Proved Reserves\nFrom January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, our total estimated proved reserves decreased 16% from 94,336 MBOE to 78,875 MBOE. Of that, estimated proved developed reserves increased 21% from 31,521 MBOE to 38,298 MBOE and estimated proved undeveloped reserves decreased 35% from 62,815 MBOE to 40,577 MBOE. The overall proved reserve decreases were primarily attributable to negative revisions due to price which included the reclassification of 11,913 MBOE of reserves from proved undeveloped to non-proved due to the five-year development rule.\nProved Reserves as of December 31, 2020\nThe below table sets forth a summary of our estimated crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves as of December 31, 2020, based on the annual reserve estimate prepared by CG&A. In preparing this reserve report, CG&A evaluated 100% of our properties at December 31, 2020. The prices used in estimating proved reserves are based on the unweighted arithmetic average\nof the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period for the year. All prices and costs associated with operating wells were held constant in accordance with the SEC guidelines.\nOur proved reserve categories as of December 31, 2020 are summarized in the table below:\n(1)Includes 21.5 MMBbl of oil, 59.6 Bcf of natural gas and 10.8 MMBbl of NGLs reserves attributable to noncontrolling interests. Additionally, $253.6 million of PV-10 and $246.9 million of standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows were attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n(2)Barrels of oil equivalent have been calculated on the basis of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas equal to one barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).\nNon-GAAP Measures\nPV-10\nPV-10 is a non-GAAP measure that differs from a measure under the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) known as \u201cstandardized measure of discounted future net cash flows\u201d in that PV-10 is calculated without including future income taxes. Management believes that the presentation of the PV-10 value of its oil and natural gas properties is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the estimated discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated proved reserves independent of our income tax attributes, thereby isolating the intrinsic value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to our reserves. We believe the use of a pre-tax measure provides greater comparability of assets when evaluating companies because the timing and quantification of future income taxes is dependent on company-specific factors, many of which are difficult to determine. For these reasons, management uses and believes that the industry generally uses the PV-10 measure in evaluating and comparing acquisition candidates and assessing the potential rate of return on investments in oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 does not necessarily represent the fair market value of oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operational performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of PV-10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (in thousands):\n(1)Includes $253.6 million attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n(2)Includes $246.9 million attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is a measure that we use as an indicator of our ability to fund our development activities. We define free cash flow as Adjusted EBITDAX (defined below), less interest expense, less accrual-based capital expenditures.\nAdjusted EBITDAX\nThe non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDAX, as calculated by us below, is intended to provide readers with meaningful information that supplements our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, this non-GAAP measure should only be considered in conjunction with financial statements and disclosures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures, such as net income or loss, operating income or loss or any other GAAP measure of financial position or results of operations. Adjusted EBITDAX is presented herein and\nreconciled from the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator.\nWe define \u201cAdjusted EBITDAX\u201d as net income plus, when applicable, accretion of asset retirement obligations; impairment expense; depletion, depreciation and amortization; interest expense, net; transaction costs; (gain) on sale of oil and gas properties, net; exploration expense; unrealized loss (gain) on derivative contracts; stock-based compensation (non-cash); and income tax benefit.\nOur Adjusted EBITDAX measure provides additional information that may be used to better understand our operations. Adjusted EBITDAX is one of several metrics that we use as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net (loss) income as an indicator of operating performance. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company\u2019s financial performance, such as a company\u2019s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets. Adjusted EBITDAX, as used by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by our management team and by other users of our consolidated financial statements. For example, Adjusted EBITDAX can be used to assess our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital structure and to assess the financial performance of our assets and our Company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis.\nReserve Quantity Information\nThe following table illustrates our estimated net proved reserves, including changes, and proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves for the periods indicated. The oil prices as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, are based on the respective 12-month unweighted average of the first of the month prices of the WTI spot prices which equates to $39.57 per barrel and $55.69 per barrel, respectively. The natural gas prices as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are based on the respective 12-month unweighted average of the first of month prices of the Henry Hub spot price which equates to $1.99 per MMBtu and $2.58 per MMBtu, respectively. The natural gas liquids prices used to value reserves as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 averaged $11.61 per barrel and $16.17 per barrel, respectively. All prices are adjusted by lease or field for energy content, transportation fees, and market differentials, resulting in the aforementioned oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves as of December 31, 2020 being valued using prices of $38.90 per barrel, $0.97 per MMBtu and $11.61 per barrel, respectively. All prices are held constant in accordance with SEC guidelines.\nA summary of our changes in quantities of proved oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nThe table below presents the quantities of proved oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves attributable to noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nNotable changes in proved reserves for the year ended December 31, 2020 included the following:\n\u2022Extensions and discoveries. In 2020, total extensions and discoveries of 860.0 MBOE was the result of successful drilling results and well performance primarily related to the Midland Basin.\n\u2022Revision to previous estimates. In 2020, the downward revisions of prior reserves of 10.7 MMBOE were primarily attributable to negative revisions due to price which included the reclassification of 11.9 MMBOE of reserves from proved undeveloped to non-proved due to the five-year development rule.\nNotable changes in proved reserves for the year ended December 31, 2019 included the following:\n\u2022Extensions and discoveries. In 2019, total extensions and discoveries of 5.1 MMBOE was a result of successful drilling results and well performance primarily related to the Midland Basin.\n\u2022Sales of minerals in place. Sales of minerals in place totaled 32.0 MBOE during 2019, resulting from the disposition of certain non-operated properties in the Midland Basin. See Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u2022Revision to previous estimates. In 2019, the downward revisions of prior reserves of 4.6 MMBOE were primarily due to reduced commodity prices.\nProved Undeveloped Reserves\nProved undeveloped reserves (\u201cPUDs\u201d) decreased from 62,815 MBOE to 40,577 MBOE or 35%, as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. PUDs represent 51% of our total proved reserves. Certain previously booked PUDs were reclassified as proved developed reserves due to successful drilling efforts. Revisions of prior estimates include certain PUDs that were reclassified to unproved categories due to development plan changes and increased well spacing. In accordance with our December 31, 2020 year-end independent engineering reserve report, we plan to drill all of our individual PUD drilling locations within the five years of original classification.\nChanges in our PUD reserves for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in MBOE):\n(1)Includes 41,560 MBOE attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n(2)Includes 34,243 MBOE attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n(3)Includes 21,737 MBOE attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n2020 Changes in Proved Undeveloped Reserves\nConversions to developed. In our year-end 2019 plan to develop its PUDs within five years, we estimated that $111.1 million of capital would be expended in 2020 for the conversion of 28 gross / 17.6 net PUDs to add 11.3 MMBOE. In 2020, due to unforeseeable conditions described above, we spent $67.8 million to convert 18 gross / 10.3 net PUDs adding 8.2 MMBOE to developed reserves.\nRevision to previous estimates. We maintain a five-year development plan, reviewed annually to ensure capital is allocated to the wells that have the highest risk-adjusted rates of return within our inventory of undrilled well locations. In response to lower commodity prices, we reduced the pace of activity in our five-year development plan. This resulted in the reclassification of 11.9 MMBOE of reserves from proved undeveloped to non-proved during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the five-year development rule. Based on our then-current acreage position, strip prices, anticipated well economics, and our development plans at the time these reserves were classified as proved, we believe the previous classification of these locations as proved undeveloped was appropriate. The remaining revisions of 2.1 MMBOE were primarily due to reduced commodity prices.\n2019 Changes in Proved Undeveloped Reserves\nConversions to developed. In our year-end 2018 plan to develop our PUDs within five years, we estimated that $103.8 million of capital would be expended in 2019 for the conversion of 30 gross / 12.3 net PUDs to add 9.9 MMBOE, which was consistent with the $111.5 million actually spent to convert 32 gross / 13.4 net PUDs adding 10.3 MMBOE to developed reserves.\nExtensions and discoveries. Additionally, 1.2 MMBOE were added as extensions and discoveries due to successful drilling results on our acreage positions because of the wells we drilled. The increase was also supported by successful drilling results by other operators directly offsetting and in close proximity to our acreage.\nRevision to previous estimates. Revisions of 3.4 MMBOE were primarily due to reduced commodity prices.\nEstimated Costs Related to Conversion of Proved Undeveloped Reserves to Proved Developed Reserves\nThe following table sets forth the estimated timing and cash flows of developing our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2020 ($ in thousands):\n(1)Beginning in 2021 and thereafter, the production and cash flows represent the drilling results from the respective year plus the incremental effects from the results of proved undeveloped drilling from previous years. These production volumes, inflows, expenses, development costs and cash flows are limited to the PUD reserves and do not include any production or cash flows from the Proved Developed category which will also help to fund our capital program.\n(2)Barrels of oil equivalent have been calculated on the basis of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas equal to one barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).\n(3)Computation is based on SEC pricing of (i) $38.90 per Bbl (WTI-Cushing oil spot prices, adjusted for differentials), (ii) $0.97 per Mcf (Henry Hub spot natural gas price), as adjusted for location and quality by property and (iii) $11.61 per Bbl for natural gas liquids.\nPUD reserves are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where additional capital expenditures are required, such as from drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells. Our development plan contemplates production to commence from all these wells by 2024.\nHistorically, our drilling programs have been substantially funded from our cash flow and borrowings under our Credit Agreement. Based on current commodity prices and our current expectations over the next five years of our cash flows and\ndrilling programs, which includes drilling of proved undeveloped and unproven locations, we believe that we can continue to substantially fund our drilling activities from our cash flow and with borrowings under the Credit Agreement.\nPreparation of Reserve Estimates\nWe engaged an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm, CG&A, to prepare our annual reserve estimates and we have relied on CG&A\u2019s expertise to ensure that our reserve estimates are prepared in compliance with SEC guidelines.\nThe technical person primarily responsible for the preparation of the reserve report is Mr. W. Todd Brooker, President of CG&A. He graduated with honors from the University of Texas at Austin in 1989 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering. Mr. Brooker is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (License No. 83462) and has more than 25 years of experience in the estimation and evaluation of oil and natural gas reserves. He is also a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.\nGeoffrey A. Vernon, our Vice President of Reservoir Engineering and A&D, is responsible for reservoir engineering, is a qualified reserve estimator and auditor and is primarily responsible for overseeing CG&A during the preparation of our annual reserve estimates. His professional qualifications meet or exceed the qualifications of reserve estimators and auditors set forth in the \u201cStandards Pertaining to Estimation and Auditing of Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Information\u201d promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. His qualifications include a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering from Texas Tech University in 2007; a Master of Business Administration degree from Rice University in 2014; member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers since 2007; and more than 13 years of practical experience in estimating and evaluating reserve information with more than nine of those years being in charge of estimating and evaluating reserves.\nWe maintain adequate and effective internal controls over our reserve estimation process as well as the underlying data upon which reserve estimates are based. The primary inputs to the reserve estimation process are technical information, financial data, ownership interest and production data. The relevant field and reservoir technical information, which is updated, at least, annually, is assessed for validity when CG&A has technical meetings with our engineers, geologists, operations and land personnel. Current revenue and expense information is obtained from our accounting records, which are subject to external quarterly reviews, annual audits and our own set of internal controls over financial reporting. Internal controls over financial reporting are assessed for effectiveness annually using criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, (2013 Version) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. All current financial data such as commodity prices, lease operating expenses, production taxes and field level commodity price differentials are updated in the reserve database and then analyzed to ensure that they have been entered accurately and that all updates are complete. Our current ownership in mineral interests and well production data are also subject to our internal controls over financial reporting, and they are incorporated in our reserve database as well and verified internally by our personnel to ensure their accuracy and completeness. Once the reserve database has been updated with current information, and the relevant technical support material has been assembled, CG&A meets with our technical personnel to review field performance and future development plans in order to further verify the validity of estimates. Following these reviews, the reserve database is furnished to CG&A so that it can prepare its independent reserve estimates and final report. The reserve estimates prepared by CG&A are reviewed and compared to our internal estimates by our Vice President of Reservoir Engineering and A&D. Material reserve estimation differences are reviewed between CG&A and us, and additional data is provided to address the differences. If the supporting documentation will not justify additional changes, the CG&A reserves are accepted. In the event that additional data supports a reserve estimation adjustment, CG&A will analyze the additional data, and may make changes it solely deems necessary. Additional data is usually comprised of updated production information on new wells. Once the review is completed and all material differences are reconciled, the reserve report is finalized and our reserve database is updated with the final estimates provided by CG&A.\nNet Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Production, Average Price and Average Production Cost\nThe net quantities of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids produced and sold by us for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the average sales price per unit sold (excluding hedges) and the average production cost per unit are presented below:\n* Barrels of oil equivalent have been calculated on the basis of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas equal to one barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).\n** Amounts exclude the impact of cash paid/received on settled derivative contracts as we did not elect to apply hedge accounting.

Our operations are all in the upstream segment of the oil and natural gas industry and all our properties are onshore in the United States. At present, our assets are located in the Midland Basin of west Texas and the Eagle Ford Trend of south Texas.\nEarthstone is the sole managing member of Earthstone Energy Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (together with its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, \u201cEEH\u201d), with a controlling interest in EEH. Earthstone, together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lynden Corp, and Lynden Corp\u2019s wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary, Lynden US and also a member of EEH, consolidates the financial results of EEH and records a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements representing the economic interests of EEH\u2019s members other than Earthstone and Lynden US (collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or similar terms).\nMidland Basin Acquisition\nOn January 7, 2021, Earthstone Energy, Inc. (\u201cEarthstone\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), Earthstone Energy Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company (\u201cEEH\u201d and collectively with Earthstone, the \u201cBuyer\u201d), Independence Resources Holdings, LLC (\u201cIndependence\u201d), and Independence Resources Manager, LLC (\u201cIndependence Manager\u201d and collectively with Independence, the \u201cSeller\u201d) consummated the transactions contemplated in the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated December 17, 2020 (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) that was previously reported on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 22, 2020. The Seller was unaffiliated with the Company. At the closing of the Purchase Agreement, among other things, EEH acquired (the \u201cAcquisition\u201d) all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Independence and Independence Manager (collectively, the \u201cAcquired Entities\u201d) for aggregate consideration consisting of the following: (i) an aggregate amount of cash from EEH equal to approximately $131.2 million (the \u201cCash Consideration\u201d) and (ii) 12,719,594 shares of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock issued to Independence (such shares, the \u201cAcquisition Shares,\u201d and such issuance, the \u201cStock Issuance\u201d). As a result of the Stock Issuance, Earthstone is no longer considered a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE rules.\nAmendment to Credit Agreement - In preparation for the IRM Acquisition, on December 17, 2020, Earthstone, EEH, as Borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d), as Administrative Agent, the guarantors party thereto, and the lenders party thereto (the \u201cLenders\u201d) entered into an amendment (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to the credit agreement dated November 21, 2019, by and among EEH, as Borrower, Earthstone, as Parent, Wells Fargo, as Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank, BOKF, NA dba Bank of Texas, as Issuing Bank with respect to Existing Letters of Credit, Royal Bank of Canada, as Syndication Agent, Truist Bank, as successor by merger to SunTrust Bank, as Documentation Agent, and the Lenders party thereto (together with all amendments or other modifications, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). The Amendment was effective upon the closing of the IRM Acquisition. Among other things, the Amendment (i) joined certain financial institutions as additional lenders, increased the borrowing base from $240.0 million to $360.0 million, (ii) increased the interest rate on outstanding borrowings; and (iii) adjusted some of the financial covenants.\nLiquidity Update\nAs of March 1, 2021, we had $10.1 million in cash and $227.5 million of long-term debt outstanding under our Credit Agreement, as amended, with a borrowing base of $360 million. With the $132.5 million of undrawn borrowing base capacity and $10.1 million in cash, we had total liquidity of approximately $142.6 million.\nAreas of Operation\nAt present, our primary efforts are concentrated in the Midland Basin of west Texas, a high oil and liquids rich resource basin that provides us with multiple horizontal targets, extensive production histories, long-lived reserves and historically high drilling success rates.\nMidland Basin\nWe believe that the Midland Basin continues to have attractive economics and we expect to continue growing our footprint through development drilling, acreage trades, asset acquisitions, and corporate merger and acquisition opportunities.\nWe continue to be active in acreage trades and acquisitions in the Midland Basin which generally allow for longer laterals, increased operated inventory and greater operating efficiency.\nDuring 2020, we completed and began producing from 9 gross / 9 net operated wells and 15 gross / 3.5 net non-operated wells. We exited 2020 with 5 gross / 3.7 net wells that were drilled and awaiting completion. We recently completed these wells and anticipate turning them to sales before the end of March 2021.\nWe recently commenced our 2021 drilling program with the deployment of a rig in Midland County. After drilling on a three-well pad in the Hamman project, we expect to drill a four-well pad on the recently acquired IRM Spanish Pearl project. We\nanticipate moving the rig to Upton County and drilling 10-11 wells. Consistent with previously released guidance, we anticipate drilling 16 gross / 14.8 net operated wells and spudding an additional 5 gross / 3.7 net operated wells during 2021.\nAdditionally, we are focused on efficiently integrating the recently acquired IRM assets into our operations. As a result of the IRM Acquisition, we added 43,400 additional net acres in the Midland Basin of which 99% is operated and 1% is non-operated, as well as adding 70 potential gross horizontal drilling locations on core acreage located in Midland and Ector counties.\nImpairments\nWe recorded impairments in 2020 as follows:\n(1)Impairments in unproved properties resulting from acreage deemed expired (not planned to be renewed).\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019\n(1)Barrels of oil equivalent have been calculated on the basis of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas equals one barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).\nNM - Not meaningful\nOil revenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, oil revenues decreased by approximately $51.6 million or 30% compared to 2019. Of the decrease, $55.1 million was attributable to lower realized prices, partially offset by $3.5 million due to increased sales volumes. Our average realized price per Bbl decreased from $55.71 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $37.85 or 32% for the year ended December 31, 2020. We had a net increase in the volume of oil sold of 93 MBbls or 3%, primarily due to new wells brought online offset by production shut-ins we initiated in May 2020 due to the domestic collapse of oil prices.\nNatural gas revenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, natural gas revenues increased by $4.7 million or 119% compared to 2019. Of the increase, $3.0 million was attributable to increased sales volumes and $1.7 million was due to higher realized prices. Our average realized price per Mcf increased 43% from $0.82 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.18 for the year ended December 31, 2020. In the prior year, lack of sufficient pipeline transportation resulted in low natural gas prices, which improved in 2020. The total volume of natural gas produced and sold increased 2,522 MMcf or 53% primarily due to new wells brought online offset by the production shut-ins we initiated in May 2020.\nNatural gas liquids revenues\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, natural gas liquids revenues were relatively flat as compared to 2019 as a $2.3 million increase attributable to higher sales volumes was mostly offset by a $2.1 million decrease due to lower realized prices. The volume of natural gas liquids produced and sold increased by 176 MBbls or 17%, primarily due to new wells brought online offset by voluntary production shut-ins in May 2020.\nLease operating expense (\u201cLOE\u201d)\nLOE includes all costs incurred to operate wells and related facilities for both operated and non-operated properties. In addition to direct operating costs such as labor, repairs and maintenance, re-engineering and workovers, equipment rentals, materials and supplies, fuel and chemicals, LOE includes product marketing and transportation fees, insurance and overhead charges provided for in operating agreements.\nLOE remained relatively flat, increasing by $0.4 million or 2% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to costs reduction efforts implemented during 2020, offset by increased production in 2020.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes\nProduction and ad valorem taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $2.5 million or 21% compared to 2019, as the impact of increased volume was more than offset by the impact of decreased commodity prices. As a percentage of revenues from oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, production taxes remained relatively flat in 2020 compared to the prior year.\nImpairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded non-cash impairments totaling $64.5 million which consisted of $25.3 million to proved oil and natural gas properties, $21.6 million to unproved oil and natural gas properties and $17.6 million to goodwill. No impairments were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019. See Note 7. Oil and Natural Gas Properties in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of how impairments are measured.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization (\u201cDD&A\u201d)\nDD&A increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 by $27.2 million, or 39% compared to 2019, primarily due to reserve reductions resulting from depressed commodity prices (lower reserve quantities leads to higher DD&A per Boe), partially offset by a first quarter 2020 impairment charge of $25.3 million which resulted in a decreased depletable oil and natural gas properties base.\nGeneral and administrative expense (\u201cG&A\u201d)\nThese expenses consist primarily of employee remuneration, professional and consulting fees and other overhead expenses. G&A increased by $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 relative to the comparable period in 2019, primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to awards granted in January 2020, offset by $0.8 million in reductions in cash-based expenses resulting from cost reduction efforts implemented in 2020.\nTransaction costs\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded transaction costs primarily due to legal, consulting and other fees of approximately $1.0 million related to the business combination which was consummated on January 7, 2021 and $0.3 million related to other potential transactions, offset by net reimbursements of $0.7 million related to the business combination (the \u201cBold Transaction\u201d) pursuant to the Bold Contribution Agreement (as defined below) which closed on May 9, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded transaction costs totaling approximately $1.1 million primarily due to the Bold Transaction.\nGain on sale of oil and gas properties, net\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we sold certain oil and gas properties located in the Midland Basin, recording gains totaling $0.2 million and $3.6 million, respectively. See Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense includes commitment fees, amortization of deferred financing costs, and interest on outstanding indebtedness. Interest expense decreased from $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to lower effective interest rates, as well as lower outstanding borrowings compared to the prior year. See Note 13. Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWrite-off of deferred financing costs\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, in connection with the termination of the prior credit agreement, $1.2 million of remaining unamortized deferred financing costs were expensed and included in Write-off of deferred financing costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 13. Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGain (loss) on derivative contracts, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a net gain on derivative contracts of $59.9 million, consisting of net realized gains on settlements of $56.0 million and unrealized mark-to-market gains of $3.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a net loss on derivative contracts of $44.0 million, consisting of unrealized mark-to-market losses of $59.8 million, partially offset by net realized gains on settlements of $15.9 million.\nIncome tax benefit (expense)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded total income tax benefit of $0.11 million which included (1) deferred income tax expense for Lynden US of $0.15 million as a result of its share of the distributable income from EEH, (2) deferred income tax benefit for Earthstone of $0.61 million as a result of its share of the distributable loss from EEH, which was offset by a valuation allowance as future realization of the net deferred tax asset cannot be assured and (3) current income tax expense of $0.55 million, offset by deferred income tax benefit of $0.51 million related to the Texas Margin Tax. Lynden Corp incurred no material income or loss, or related income tax expense or benefit, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a total income tax expense of $1.7 million which included (1) deferred income tax expense for Lynden US of $0.1 million as a result of its share of the distributable income from EEH, (2) deferred income tax expense for Earthstone of $0.4 million as a result of its share of the distributable income from EEH, which was used to reduce the valuation allowance recorded against its deferred tax asset as future realization of the net deferred tax asset cannot be assured and (3) deferred income tax expense of $1.6 million related to the Texas Margin Tax. Lynden Corp incurred no material income or loss, or related income tax expense or benefit, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have significant undeveloped acreage and future drilling locations. Drilling horizontal wells, generally consisting of 7,500 to 12,000-foot lateral lengths, in the Midland Basin is capital intensive. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.5 million in cash and $115 million of long-term debt outstanding under our Credit Agreement with a borrowing base of $240 million. With the $125 million of undrawn borrowing base capacity and $1.5 million in cash, we had total liquidity of approximately $126.5 million. Subsequent to year-end, Earthstone closed on its previously announced acquisition of IRM and amended the Credit Agreement. As of March 1, 2021, we had $10.1 million in cash and $227.5 million of long-term debt outstanding under our Credit Agreement, as amended, with a borrowing base of $360 million. With the $132.5 million of undrawn borrowing base capacity and $10.1 million in cash, we had total liquidity of approximately $142.6 million.\nAs oil prices have recovered recently from their 2020 lows, we are preparing to resume drilling operations with the deployment of a rig late in the first quarter of 2021 and we expect to spend $90-$100 million based on our current 2021 drilling plan. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity with cash flows from operations and borrowings under the Credit Agreement to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months.\nWorking Capital\nWorking Capital (presented below) was a deficit of $20.8 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to a deficit of $39.9 million as of December 31, 2019, representing an improvement of $19.2 million. The improvement was primarily due to the reduction of liabilities resulting from reduced drilling activity. The components of working capital are presented below:\nWe expect that changes in receivables and payables related to our pace of development, production volumes, changes in our hedging activities, realized commodity prices and differentials to NYMEX prices for our oil and natural gas production will continue to be the largest variables affecting our working capital.\nWe expect to finance future development activities with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and, various means of corporate and project financing. Additionally, we may continue to partially finance our drilling activities through the sale of participating rights to financial institutions or industry participants, and we could structure such arrangements on a promoted basis, whereby we may earn working interests in reserves and production greater than our proportionate share of capital costs.\nIn July 2019, we entered into a Wellbore Development Agreement (\u201cWDA\u201d) with a non-affiliated industry partner. This WDA reduced our working interest in certain wells in Reagan County. The industry partner paid a promoted (proportionately higher) share of the capital expenditures on eight wells, to earn 35% of the working interest in these wells.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur accrual basis capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nHedging Activities\nThe following table sets forth our outstanding derivative contracts at December 31, 2020. When aggregating multiple contracts, the weighted average contract price is disclosed.\n(1)The basis differential price is between WTI Midland Argus Crude and the WTI NYMEX.\n(2)The basis differential price is between W. Texas (WAHA) and the Henry Hub NYMEX.\nOn January 7, 2021, upon closing of the IRM Acquisition, IRM had hedges in place for approximately 1,008,950 Bbls of oil at $41.07/Bbl.\nHedging Update\nThe following table sets forth our outstanding derivative contracts at March 4, 2021. When aggregating multiple contracts, the weighted average contract price is disclosed.\n(1) The basis differential price is between WTI Midland Argus Crude and the WTI NYMEX.\n(2) The swap is between WTI Roll and the WTI NYMEX.\n(3) The basis differential price is between W. Texas (WAHA) and the Henry Hub NYMEX.\nObligations and Commitments\nWe had the following contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020:\n(1)2021 amount represents interest payable under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2020.\n(2)We have a non-cancelable fixed cost agreement of $0.7 million per year through May 2021 to reserve pipeline capacity of 10,000 MMBtu per day for gathering and processing related to certain Eagle Ford assets in south Texas. As the operator of the properties dedicated to this contract, the gross amount of obligation is provided; however, our net share is approximately 31%.\nOn January 7, 2021, upon closing of the IRM Acquisition, EEH became party to an office lease with an effective termination date of May 31, 2021, for which the remaining obligation is approximately $0.26 million.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nOur operations are subject to risks normally associated with the exploration for and the production of oil and natural gas, including blowouts, fires, and environmental risks such as oil spills or natural gas leaks that could expose us to liabilities associated with these risks.\nIn our acquisition of existing or previously drilled well bores, we may not be aware of prior environmental safeguards, if any, that were taken at the time such wells were drilled or during such time the wells were operated. We maintain comprehensive insurance coverage that we believe is adequate to mitigate the risk of any adverse financial effects associated with these risks.\nHowever, should it be determined that a liability exists with respect to any environmental cleanup or restoration, the liability to cure such a violation could still accrue to us. No claim has been made, nor are we aware of any liability which we may have, as it relates to any environmental cleanup, restoration, or the violation of any rules or regulations relating thereto.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these statements requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. We base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other sources that we believe to be reasonable at the time. Actual results may vary from our estimates due to changes in circumstances, weather, politics, global economics, mechanical problems, general business conditions and other risks. We have outlined below certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management.\nOil and Natural Gas Properties\nWe use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas operations. Under this method, costs to acquire oil and natural gas properties, drill successful exploratory wells, drill and equip development wells, and install production facilities are capitalized. Exploration costs, including unsuccessful exploratory wells, geological and geophysical are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the leasehold and development costs that are capitalized for proved oil and natural gas properties are computed using the units-of-production method, at the field level, based on total proved reserves and proved developed reserves, respectively, as estimated by independent petroleum engineers. Oil and natural gas properties are periodically assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group, but at least annually. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, generally on a field-by-field basis. All of our properties are located within the continental United States.\nOil and Natural Gas Reserve Quantities\nReserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows affect our periodic calculations of depletion, impairment of our oil and natural gas properties, and asset retirement obligations. Proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Reserve quantities and future cash flows included in this report are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d). The accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of:\n\u2022The quality and quantity of available data;\n\u2022The interpretation of that data;\n\u2022The accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and\n\u2022The judgments of the persons preparing the estimates.\nOur proved reserves information included in this report is based on estimates prepared by our independent petroleum engineers, CG&A. The independent petroleum engineers evaluated 100% of our estimated proved reserve quantities and their related future net cash flows as of December 31, 2020. Estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than our estimates. Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may differ substantially from actual results, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. We make revisions to reserve estimates throughout the year as additional information becomes available. We make changes to depletion rates, impairment calculations, and asset retirement obligations in the same period that changes to reserve estimates are made.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nOur rate of recording DD&A is dependent upon our estimates of total proved and proved developed reserves, which estimates incorporate various assumptions and future projections. If the estimates of total proved or proved developed reserves decline, the rate at which we record DD&A expense increases, reducing our net income. Such a decline in reserves may result from lower commodity prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields. We are unable to predict changes in reserve quantity estimates as such quantities are dependent on the success of our exploitation and development program, as well as future economic conditions.\nImpairment of Oil and Natural Gas Properties\nWe review the value of our oil and natural gas properties whenever management judges that events and circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of properties may not be recoverable. Impairments of producing properties are determined by comparing the pretax future net undiscounted cash flows to the net book value at the end of each period. If the net capitalized cost exceeds undiscounted future cash flows, the cost of the property is written down to \u201cfair value,\u201d which is determined based on expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved, using prices and costs consistent with those used for internal decision making. Different pricing assumptions or discount rates could result in a different calculated impairment. We provide for impairments on significant undeveloped properties when we determine that the property will not be developed or a permanent impairment in value has occurred.\nAsset Retirement Obligation\nOur asset retirement obligations (\u201cAROs\u201d) consist primarily of estimated future costs associated with the plugging and abandonment of oil and natural gas wells, removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and land restoration in accordance with applicable local, state and federal laws. The discounted fair value of an ARO liability is required to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred, with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and natural gas asset. The recognition of an ARO requires that management make numerous assumptions regarding such factors as the estimated probabilities, amounts and timing of settlements; the credit-adjusted risk-free rate to be used; inflation rates; and future advances in technology. In periods subsequent to the initial measurement of the ARO, we must recognize period-to-period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows. Increases in the ARO liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense. The related capitalized cost, including revisions thereto, is charged to expense through DD&A over the life of the field.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activity\nWe are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations, such as commodity price risk. Derivative contracts are utilized to economically hedge our exposure to price fluctuations and reduce the variability in our cash flows associated with anticipated sales of future oil and natural gas production. We follow FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d)\nTopic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, to account for our derivative financial instruments. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative trading purposes. It is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive. We did not post collateral under any of these contracts.\nOur crude oil and natural gas derivative positions consist of swaps. Swaps are designed so that we receive or make payments based on a differential between fixed and variable prices for crude oil and natural gas. We have elected to not designate any of our derivative contracts for hedge accounting. Accordingly, we record the net change in the mark-to-market valuation of these derivative contracts, as well as all payments and receipts on settled derivative contracts, in \u201c(Loss) gain on derivative contracts, net\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All derivative contracts are recorded at fair market value and are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities.\nIncome Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions\nWe are a U.S. company operating in Texas, as of December 31, 2020, as well as one foreign legal entity, Lynden Corp, which is a Canadian company. Consequently, our tax provision is based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the applicable jurisdiction in which our operations are conducted and income is earned. The income tax rates imposed and methods of computing taxable income in these jurisdictions vary. Therefore, as a part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of these jurisdictions. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes. Our effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions.\nOur corporate structure requires the filing of two separate consolidated U.S. Federal income tax returns and one Canadian income tax return resulting from Earthstone\u2019s acquisition of Lynden Corp in 2016 (the \u201cLynden Arrangement\u201d) that includes Lynden US, Earthstone, and Lynden Corp. As such, taxable income of Earthstone cannot be offset by tax attributes, including net operating losses, of Lynden US, nor can taxable income of Lynden US be offset by tax attributes of Earthstone. Earthstone and Lynden US record a tax provision, respectively, for their share of the book income or loss of EEH, net of the noncontrolling interest, as well as any standalone income or loss generated by each company. As EEH is treated as a partnership for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, it is not subject to income tax at the federal level and only recognizes the Texas Margin Tax.\nOn January 7, 2021, upon closing of the IRM Acquisition, the acquired entity, Independence Resources Management, LLC (along with its wholly owned subsidiaries, collectively \u201cIRM\u201d), became a wholly owned subsidiary of EEH. IRM\u2019s results will be reported on the U.S. Return of Partnership Income (Form 1065) and will flow to EEH through Schedule K-1 (Form 1065). As IRM is treated as a Partnership, for federal and state income tax purposes, it is not subject to income taxes at the federal level. At the state level, IRM only operates in Texas and is subject to the Texas Margin Tax.\nOur deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe apply the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes. This accounting guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements. It requires that we recognize in the consolidated financial statements the financial effects of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, including resolution of any appeals or litigation processes, based upon the technical merits of the position. It also provides guidance on measurement, classification, interest, penalties and disclosure. Our tax positions related to our pass-through status and state income tax liability, including deductibility of expenses, have been reviewed by our management and they believe those positions would more likely than not be sustained upon examination. Accordingly, we have not recorded an income tax liability for uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe predominantly derive our revenue from the sale of produced oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Revenues are recognized when the recognition criteria of FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, are met, which generally occurs at the point in which title passes to the customers. We receive payment from one to three months after delivery. At the end of each quarter, we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers and the price we will receive. Variances between our estimated revenue and actual payment are recorded in the month the payment is received. Historically, however, differences have been insignificant.\nAccounting for Business Combinations\nOur business has grown substantially through acquisitions, and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise. We have accounted for all of our business combinations to date using the purchase method.\nUnder the purchase method of accounting, a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given. The assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair value including the recognition of acquisition-related costs that are separate from the acquired net assets. The purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values. The excess of the cost of an acquired entity, if any, over the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity, if any, is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain acquired assets.\nDetermining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment, since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable. Different techniques may be used to determine fair values, including market prices (where available), appraisals, and comparison to transactions for similar assets and liabilities, and present value of estimated future cash flows, among others. Since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment, they can change as new information becomes available.\nGoodwill\nWe account for goodwill in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired net of the fair value of the liabilities assumed in an acquisition. ASC Topic 350 requires that goodwill be evaluated on an annual basis for impairment or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could potentially result in an impairment.\nWe conduct a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment by examining relevant events and circumstances which could have a negative impact on our goodwill such as, industry and market conditions, including commodity prices, costs factors, and other company specific events. If we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we do not have to perform the two-step impairment test. If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances described, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill test is performed. The two-step goodwill impairment test is also performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If, after performing the two-step goodwill test, it is determined that the carrying value of goodwill is impaired, the amount of goodwill is reduced and a corresponding charge is made to earnings in the period in which the goodwill is determined to be impaired\nNoncontrolling Interest\nWe account for noncontrolling interest in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, which requires the recording of a noncontrolling interest component of Net (loss) income, as well as a noncontrolling interest component within equity. Noncontrolling interest represents third-party equity ownership of EEH and is presented as a component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, as well as an adjustment to Net (loss) income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Earthstone and Lynden US held 46.4% of the outstanding membership interests in EEH while Bold Holdings, the noncontrolling party, held the remaining 53.6%.

Controls and Procedures\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit to the SEC under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nIn accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As described below under paragraph (b) within Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC\u2019s rules and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThe audit report of our independent registered public accounting firm, which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, expressed an unqualified opinion on our consolidated financial statements.\n(b) Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u2022pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n\u2022provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management; and\n\u2022provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nWhile \u201creasonable assurance\u201d is a high level of assurance, it does not mean absolute assurance. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatement and instance of fraud. Controls are susceptible to manipulation, especially in instances of fraud caused by collusion of two or more people. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this evaluation, management used the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of December 31, 2020.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements, has also issued its own audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, which is included herein.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nEarthstone Energy, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Earthstone Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries\u2019 (the \u201cCompany\u201d) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the consolidated balance sheets of Earthstone Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d) and our report dated March 10, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Moss Adams LLP\nHouston, Texas\nMarch 10, 2021\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2018.",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 10, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAssessment of the Estimated Proved Oil and Gas Reserves on the Determination of Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expense related to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Impairment of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Properties\nThe Company\u2019s net proved oil and natural gas properties balance was $731.7 million as of December 31, 2020, and the associated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense and impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $95.9 million and $25.3 million, respectively. As described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties. The Company\u2019s lease acquisition costs and development costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are amortized using the units-of-production method, at the field level, based on total estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves and estimated proved developed oil and natural gas reserves, respectively. Proved oil and natural gas properties are reviewed for impairment on a nonrecurring basis. The impairment charge reduces the carrying values to their estimated fair values. These fair value measurements are classified as Level 3 measurements and include many unobservable inputs. Fair value is calculated as the estimated discounted future\nnet cash flows attributable to the assets. The Company\u2019s primary assumptions in preparing the estimated discounted future net cash flows to be recovered from oil and natural gas properties are based on (i) proved reserves, (ii) forward commodity prices and assumptions as to costs and expenses, and (iii) the estimated discount rate that would be used by potential purchasers to determine the fair value of the assets.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved oil and natural gas reserves on proved net oil and natural gas properties is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management, including the use of specialists, when developing the estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the significant assumptions used in developing those estimates, including future production, future oil and natural gas prices, future pricing differentials, and future development costs.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n\u2022Testing the operating effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves, the calculation of DD&A expense, and the impairment assessment of proved oil and natural gas properties.\n\u2022Evaluating the significant assumptions used by management in developing these estimates, including future production, future oil and gas prices, future pricing differentials, and future development costs.\n\u2022Utilizing the work of management\u2019s specialists to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves. As a basis for this work, the specialists\u2019 qualifications and objectivity were assessed, as well as the reasonableness of methods and assumptions used by the specialists. The procedures performed also included testing the data used by the specialists and evaluating the specialists\u2019 findings. Evaluating the significant assumptions relating to the estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves also involved obtaining evidence to support the reasonableness of the assumptions, including whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering the past performance of the Company, and whether they were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n\u2022Testing management\u2019s impairment assessment of proved oil and natural gas properties. This included evaluating management\u2019s cash flow analysis related to the proved oil and natural gas properties. In addition, we involved internal valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the discount rate used in the valuation by comparing it against a discount rate range that was independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities.\n\u2022Testing the inputs of and recalculating management\u2019s DD&A calculation.\n/s/ Moss Adams LLP\nHouston, Texas\nMarch 10, 2021\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2018.\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EQUITY\n(In thousands, except share amounts)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In thousands)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. - Organization and Basis of Presentation\nEarthstone Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cEarthstone\u201d and together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the \u201cCompany\u201d), is a growth-oriented independent oil and natural gas development and production company. In addition, the Company is active in corporate mergers and the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties that have production and future development opportunities. The Company\u2019s operations are all in the up-stream segment of the oil and natural gas industry and all its properties are onshore in the United States.\nEarthstone is the sole managing member of Earthstone Energy Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (together with its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, \u201cEEH\u201d), with a controlling interest in EEH. Earthstone, together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lynden Energy Corp., a corporation organized under the laws of British Columbia (\u201cLynden Corp\u201d), and Lynden Corp\u2019s wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary, Lynden USA Inc., a Utah corporation (\u201cLynden US\u201d) and also a member of EEH, consolidates the financial results of EEH and records a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements representing the economic interests of EEH\u2019s members other than Earthstone and Lynden US.\nNote 2. - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts and balances of the Company and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). All intercompany accounts and transactions, including revenues and expenses, are eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company\u2019s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods then ended.\nEstimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves are the most significant of the Company\u2019s estimates. All reserve data used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as included in Note 21. Supplemental Information On Oil And Gas Exploration And Production Activities (Unaudited), are based on estimates. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that are ultimately recovered.\nOther items subject to estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, asset retirement obligations, valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets, valuation of derivative instruments and valuation of certain performance-based restricted stock unit awards. Management evaluates estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic and commodity price environment. The volatility of commodity prices results in increased uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. See Note 21. Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities (Unaudited).\nAlthough management believes these estimates are reasonable, actual results may differ from estimates and assumptions of future events and these revisions could be material. Future production may vary materially from estimated oil and natural gas proved reserves. Actual future prices may vary significantly from price assumptions used for determining proved reserves and for financial reporting.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable include estimated amounts due from crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids purchasers, other operators for which the Company holds an interest, and from non-operating working interest owners. Accrued crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids sales from purchasers and operators consist of accrued revenues due under normal trade terms, generally requiring payment within 60 days of production. For receivables from joint interest owners, the Company typically has the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint interest billings.\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nAn allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on reviews of individual customer accounts, recent loss experience, current economic conditions, and other pertinent factors. Accounts deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance.\nProvisions for bad debts and recoveries on accounts previously charged off are added to the allowance. The Company routinely assesses the recoverability of all material trade receivables and other receivables to determine their collectability. Allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $0.02 million and $0.1 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company utilizes derivative instruments in order to manage exposure to risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates. The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities, measured at fair value, and recognizes changes in the fair value of derivatives in current earnings. The Company has elected to not designate any of its positions under the hedge accounting rules. Accordingly, these derivative contracts are mark-to-market and any changes in the estimated values of derivative contracts held at the balance sheet date are recognized in Gain (loss) on derivative contracts, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as unrealized gains or losses on derivative contracts. Realized gains or losses on derivative contracts are also recognized in Gain (loss) on derivative contracts, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOil and Natural Gas Properties\nThe method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties determines what costs are capitalized and how these costs are ultimately matched with revenues and expenses. The Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties. For more information see Note 7. Oil and Natural Gas Properties.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of assets acquired over the fair value of those assets and is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Such test includes an assessment of qualitative and quantitative factors.\nA discounted future cash flow analysis of the properties to which the Goodwill was associated was performed based on commodity price futures as of March 31, 2020. The resulting fair value was lower than the net book value of the associated properties. Additionally, the Company\u2019s enterprise value, calculated as the combined market capitalization of the Company\u2019s equity and long-term debt, was lower than the book value of its assets, without allocating between the Company's two major properties, Midland properties and Eagle Ford properties. Accordingly, the entire $17.6 million balance of Goodwill was impaired on that date, resulting in no remaining amounts subject to impairment. There were no impairments to Goodwill recorded in the year ended December 31, 2019. For further discussion, see Note 8. Goodwill.\nOffice and Other Equipment\nOffice and other equipment primarily includes leasehold improvements, vehicles, computer equipment and software, office furniture and fixtures and field equipment. These items are recorded at cost, or fair value if acquired, and are depreciated using the straight-line method based on expected lives of the individual assets or group of assets ranging from two years to 10 years. The Company had office and other equipment of $0.9 million and $1.3 million, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization of $3.7 million and $3.2 million, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized depreciation expense of $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively. See separate finance lease disclosures in Note 19. Leases.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nNoncontrolling Interest represents third-party equity ownership of EEH and is presented as a component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, as well as an adjustment to Net income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020, Earthstone and Lynden US owned a 46.4% membership interest in EEH while Bold Energy Holdings, LLC (\u201cBold Holdings\u201d), the noncontrolling third-party, owned the remaining 53.6%. See further discussion in Note 9. Noncontrolling Interest.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are components of an enterprise that (i) engage in activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (ii) for which separate operational financial information is available and is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker for the purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance.\nBased on the Company\u2019s organization and management, it has only one reportable operating segment, which is oil and natural gas exploration and production.\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nComprehensive Income\nThe Company has no elements of comprehensive income other than net income.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAsset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets are recognized as liabilities with an increase to the carrying amounts of the related long-lived assets in the period incurred. The cost of the asset, including the asset retirement cost, is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. Asset retirement obligations are recorded at estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligations discounted at the Company\u2019s credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liabilities are accreted to their expected settlement value. If estimated future costs of asset retirement obligations change, an adjustment is recorded to both the asset retirement obligations and the long-lived asset. Revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates, and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment. For further discussion, see Note 14. Asset Retirement Obligations.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for its acquisitions of oil and gas properties not commonly controlled in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 805, Business Combinations, which, among other things, requires the Company to determine if an asset or a business has been acquired. If the Company determines an asset(s) has been acquired, the asset(s) acquired, as well as any liabilities assumed, are measured and recorded at the acquisition date cost. If the Company determines a business has been acquired, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured and recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date, recording goodwill for amounts paid in excess of fair value.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company\u2019s revenues are comprised solely of revenues from customers and include the sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. The Company believes that the disaggregation of revenue into these three major product types, as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, appropriately depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors based on its single geographic region. Revenues are recognized when the recognition criteria of ASC 606 \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d (\u201cASC 606\u201d) are met, which generally occurs at a point in time when production is sold to a purchaser at a determinable price, delivery has occurred, control has transferred and collection of the revenue is probable. The Company fulfills its performance obligations under its customer contracts through delivery of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and revenues are recorded on a monthly basis and the Company receives payment from one to three months after delivery. Generally, each unit of product represents a separate performance obligation. The prices received for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids sales under the Company\u2019s contracts are generally derived from stated market prices which are then adjusted to reflect deductions including transportation, fractionation and processing. As a result, revenues from the sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids will decrease if market prices decline. The sales of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, represent the Company\u2019s share of revenues net of royalties and excluding revenue interests owned by others. When selling oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids on behalf of royalty or working interest owners, the Company is acting as an agent and thus reports the revenue on a net basis. To the extent actual volumes and prices of oil and natural gas sales are unavailable for a given reporting period because of timing or information not received from third parties, the expected sales volumes and prices for those properties are estimated and recorded. Variances between the Company\u2019s estimated revenue and actual payment are recorded in the month the payment is received. Historically, however, differences have been insignificant.\nAt the end of each month when the performance obligation is satisfied, the variable consideration can be reasonably estimated and amounts due from customers are recorded in \u201cAccounts receivable: oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids revenues\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, amounts receivable from contracts with customers were $16.3 million and $29.0 million, respectively. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities on oil, natural gas and NGL sales are presented separately from such revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOil Sales\nOil production is transported from the wellhead to tank batteries or delivery points through flow-lines or gathering systems. Purchasers of the oil take delivery at (i) the tank batteries and transport the oil by truck, or (ii) at a pipeline delivery point and the Company collects a market price, net of pricing differentials. Revenue is recognized when control transfers to the purchaser at the net price received by the Company. Starting in October 2019, certain of the Company\u2019s oil sales activity involves buy/sell arrangements that effect a change in location with required repurchase of oil at a delivery point. Because the Company acts as\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nthe agent in these transactions, the buy/sell activity is recorded on a net basis and the residual transportation fee is included in Lease operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNatural Gas and NGL Sales\nUnder the Company\u2019s natural gas sales arrangements, the purchaser takes control of wet gas at a delivery point near the wellhead or at the inlet of the purchaser\u2019s processing facility. The purchaser gathers and processes the wet gas and remits proceeds to the Company for the resulting natural gas and NGL sales. Based on the nature of these arrangements, the Company is the agent and the purchaser is the Company\u2019s customer, thus, the Company recognizes natural gas and NGL sales based on the net amount of proceeds received from the purchaser.\nImbalances\nThe Company recognizes revenue for all oil, natural gas and NGL sold to purchasers regardless of whether the sales are proportionate to the Company\u2019s ownership interest in the property. Production imbalances are recognized as a liability to the extent an imbalance on a specific property exceeds the Company\u2019s share of remaining proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. The Company is also subject to natural gas pipeline imbalances, which are recorded as accounts receivable or payable at values consistent with contractual arrangements with the owner of the pipeline. The Company had no imbalances as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nContract Balances\nUnder the Company\u2019s product sales contracts, the Company invoices customers once performance obligations have been satisfied, at which point payment is unconditional. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s product sales contracts do not give rise to contract assets or liabilities under ASC 606.\nTransaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s product sales are short-term in nature, with a contract term of one year or less. For these contracts, the Company has utilized the practical expedient in ASC 606 which exempts the Company from the requirements to disclose the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less.\nFor the Company\u2019s product sales that have a contract term greater than one year, the Company has utilized the practical expedient in ASC 606 which states the Company is not required to disclose the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation. Under these contracts, each unit of product generally represents a separate performance obligation\u037e therefore, future volumes are wholly unsatisfied, and disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is not required.\nPrior-Period Performance Obligations\nThe Company records revenue in the month that product is delivered to the purchaser. Settlement statements for certain natural gas and NGLs sales, however, may not be received for 30 to 90 days after the date the product is delivered, and as a result the Company is required to estimate the amount of product delivered to the purchaser and the price that will be received for the sale of the product. In these situations, the Company records the differences between its estimates and the actual amounts received for product sales in the month that payment is received from the purchaser. Any identified differences between the Company\u2019s revenue estimates and actual revenue received have historically been insignificant. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, revenue recognized in the reporting period related to performance obligations satisfied in prior reporting periods was not material.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nCredit risk represents the actual or perceived financial loss that the Company would record if its purchasers, operators, or counterparties failed to perform pursuant to contractual terms.\nThe purchasers of the Company\u2019s oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production consist primarily of independent marketers, major oil and natural gas companies and natural gas pipeline companies. Historically, the Company has not experienced any significant losses from uncollectible accounts. In the year ended December 31, 2020, three purchasers accounted for 32%, 15% and 12%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids revenues. In the year ended December 31, 2019, three purchasers accounted for 30%, 14% and 12%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids revenues. No other purchaser accounted for 10% or more of the Company\u2019s oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids revenues during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Additionally, at December 31, 2020, three purchasers accounted for 18%, 17% and 16%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids receivables. At December 31, 2019, three purchasers accounted for 46%, 14% and 10%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s oil,\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nnatural gas, and natural gas liquids receivables. No other purchaser accounted for 10% or more of the Company\u2019s oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids receivables at December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nThe Company holds working interests in oil and natural gas properties for which a third-party serves as operator. The operator sells the oil, natural gas, and NGLs to the purchaser, collects the cash, and distributes the cash to the Company. In the year ended December 31, 2020, one operator distributed 15% of the Company\u2019s oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues. In the year ended December 31, 2019, no operator distributed 10% or more of the Company\u2019s oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues.\nThe derivative instruments of the Company are with a small number of counterparties and, from time-to-time, may represent material assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2020, the Company had a net derivative asset position of $6.6 million. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $2.7 million of derivative contracts that were in a material asset position.\nThe Company regularly maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts. Balances held by the Company at its banks typically exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) insurance coverage and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to the amounts of deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognized stock-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock units, which include both time- and performance-based awards. The Company accounts for forfeitures of equity-based incentive awards as they occur. Stock-based compensation expense related to time-based restricted stock units is based on the price of the Class A common stock, $0.001 par value per share of Earthstone (\u201cClass A Common Stock\u201d), on the grant date and recognized over the vesting period using the straight-line method. Stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units, which cliff vest, is based on a grant date Monte Carlo Simulation pricing model, which calculates multiple potential outcomes for an award and establishes fair value based on the most likely outcome, and is recognized over the vesting period using the straight-line method. See Note 12. Stock-Based Compensation for further details.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is a U.S. company operating in Texas, as of December 31, 2020, as well as one foreign legal entity, Lynden Corp, which is a Canadian company. Consequently, the Company\u2019s tax provision is based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the applicable jurisdiction in which its operations are conducted and income is earned. The income tax rates imposed and methods of computing taxable income in these jurisdictions vary. Therefore, as a part of the process of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is required to estimate the income taxes in each of these jurisdictions. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as its operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions.\nThe Company records an income tax provision consistent with its status as a corporation. The Company\u2019s corporate structure requires the filing of two separate consolidated U.S. Federal income tax returns and one Canadian income tax return resulting from Earthstone\u2019s acquisition of Lynden Corp in May 2016 (the \u201cLynden Arrangement\u201d) that includes Lynden US, Earthstone, and Lynden Corp. As such, taxable income of Earthstone cannot be offset by tax attributes, including net operating losses, of Lynden US, nor can taxable income of Lynden US be offset by tax attributes of Earthstone. Earthstone and Lynden US record a tax provision, respectively, for their share of the book income or loss of EEH, net of the noncontrolling interest, as well as any standalone income or loss generated by each company. As EEH is treated as a partnership for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, it is not subject to income tax at the federal level and only recognizes the Texas Margin Tax.\nThe Company\u2019s deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company applies the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes. This accounting guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. It requires that the Company recognize in the Consolidated Financial Statements the financial effects of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, including resolution of any appeals or litigation processes, based upon the technical merits of the position. It also provides guidance on measurement, classification, interest, penalties and disclosure. The Company\u2019s tax positions related to its pass-through status and state income tax liability, including deductibility of expenses, have been reviewed by the Company\u2019s management and they believe those positions would more likely than not be sustained upon\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nexamination. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded an income tax liability for uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other - In January 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance simplifying the test for goodwill impairment. The update eliminates the requirement to determine the implied value of goodwill in measuring an impairment loss. Upon adoption, the measurement of a goodwill impairment will represent the excess of the reporting unit\u2019s carrying value over its fair value and will be limited to the carrying value of goodwill. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. The update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The Company adopted the update effective January 1, 2020 and the impact was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See further discussion of goodwill in Note 8. Goodwill.\nFair Value Measurements - In August 2018, the FASB issued an update which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the update effective January 1, 2020 and the impact was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes - In December 2019, the FASB issued an update that simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the update effective January 1, 2021 and the impact was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit Losses - In June 2016, the FASB issued an update that requires changes to the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments not accounted for at fair value through net income, including loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases and available-for-sale debt securities. The amended standard broadens the information that an entity must consider in developing its estimate of expected credit losses, requiring an entity to estimate credit losses over the life of an exposure based on historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted the update effective January 1, 2020 and the impact was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nReference Rate Reform - In March 2020, the FASB issued an update that provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate. The ASU intends to address certain concerns relating to accounting for contract modifications and hedge accounting. These optional expedients and exceptions to applying GAAP, assuming certain criteria are met, are allowed through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this update and has not yet determined whether it will elect the optional expedients. The Company does not expect the transition to an alternative rate to have a material impact on its business, operations or liquidity.\nNote 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures\nThe initial accounting for acquisitions and divestitures may not be complete and adjustments to provisional amounts, or recognition of additional assets acquired or liabilities assumed, may occur as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates.\nMidland Basin Acquisition\nOn January 7, 2021, the Company completed an acquisition as described in Note 20. Subsequent Event.\nDivestitures\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold certain non-core properties for approximately $4.2 million in cash, resulting in a gain of approximately $3.6 million recorded in Gain on sale of oil and gas properties, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were no material divestitures during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNote 4. Transaction Costs\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded transaction costs primarily due to legal, consulting and other fees of approximately $1.0 million related to the acquisition noted above and $0.3 million related to other potential transactions, offset by net reimbursements of $0.7 million related to the business combination (the \u201cBold Transaction\u201d) pursuant to the Bold Contribution Agreement (as defined below) which closed on May 9, 2017.\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded transaction costs totaling approximately $1.1 million primarily due to the Bold Transaction.\nNote 5. Fair Value Measurements\nFASB ASC Topic 820, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date and requires consideration of the counterparty\u2019s creditworthiness when valuing certain assets.\nThe three-level fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements defined by ASC Topic 820 is as follows:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. An active market is defined as a market where transactions for the financial instrument occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2 - Inputs, other than quoted prices within Level 1, that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument\u2019s anticipated life.\nLevel 3 - Prices or valuations that require unobservable inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. Valuation under Level 3 generally involves a significant degree of judgment from management.\nA financial instrument\u2019s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instrument\u2019s complexity. The Company reflects transfers between the three levels at the beginning of the reporting period in which the availability of observable inputs no longer justifies classification in the original level. There were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFair Value on a Recurring Basis\nDerivative financial instruments are carried at fair value and measured on a recurring basis. The derivative financial instruments consist of swaps for crude oil and natural gas and interest rate swaps. The Company\u2019s commodity price hedges and interest rate swaps are valued based on discounted future cash flow models that are primarily based on published forward commodity price curves and published LIBOR forward curves; thus, these inputs are designated as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.\nThe fair values of derivative instruments in asset positions include measures of counterparty nonperformance risk, and the fair values of derivative instruments in liability positions include measures of the Company\u2019s nonperformance risk. These measurements were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, by level within the fair-value hierarchy (in thousands):\nOther financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable and payable, and revenue royalties. The carrying amount of these instruments approximates fair value because of their short-term nature. The Company\u2019s long-term debt obligation bears interest at floating market rates, therefore carrying amounts and fair value are approximately equal.\nFair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nThe Company applies the provisions of the fair value measurement standard on a non-recurring basis to its non-financial assets and liabilities, including oil and gas properties and goodwill. These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances.\nProved Oil and Natural Gas Properties\nProved oil and natural gas properties are reviewed for impairment on a nonrecurring basis. The impairment charge reduces the carrying values to their estimated fair values. These fair value measurements are classified as Level 3 measurements and include many unobservable inputs. Fair value is calculated as the estimated discounted future net cash flows attributable to the assets. The Company\u2019s primary assumptions in preparing the estimated discounted future net cash flows to be recovered from oil and natural gas properties are based on (i) proved reserves, (ii) forward commodity prices and assumptions as to costs and expenses, and (iii) the estimated discount rate that would be used by potential purchasers to determine the fair value of the assets. See Note 7. Oil and Natural Gas Properties.\nPerformance Units\nAmong other things, the Earthstone Amended and Restated 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the \u201c2014 Plan\u201d) allows for the grant of performance units. The Company accounts for these awards as market-based awards which are valued utilizing the Monte Carlo Simulation pricing model, which calculates multiple potential outcomes for an award and establishes grant date fair value based on the most likely outcome. See Note 12. Stock-Based Compensation.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of assets acquired over the fair value of those assets and is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the fair value of goodwill may be less than its carrying amount. Such test includes an assessment of qualitative and quantitative factors. See Note 8. Goodwill.\nBusiness Combinations\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe Company records the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value at the date of acquisition on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value may be estimated using comparable market data, a discounted cash flow method, or a combination of the two. In the discounted cash flow method, estimated future cash flows are based on management\u2019s expectations for the future and include estimates of future oil and natural gas production, commodity prices based on NYMEX commodity futures price strips as of the date of the estimate, operating and development costs, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. The future oil and natural gas pricing used in the valuation is a Level 2 assumption. Significant Level 3 assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted cash flows used in the determination of fair value of the acquisition include the Company\u2019s estimate operating and development costs, anticipated production of proved reserves, appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. The Company\u2019s acquisitions are discussed in Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe asset retirement obligation estimates are derived from historical costs and management\u2019s expectation of future cost environments; and therefore, the Company has designated these liabilities as Level 3. The significant inputs to this fair value measurement include estimates of plugging, abandonment and remediation costs, well life, inflation and credit-adjusted risk-free rate. See Note 14. Asset Retirement Obligations for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the liability for the Company\u2019s asset retirement obligations.\nNote 6. Derivative Financial Instruments\nCommodity Derivative Instruments\nThe Company\u2019s hedging activities consist of derivative instruments entered into in order to hedge against changes in oil and natural gas prices through the use of fixed price swaps and basis swaps agreements. Swaps exchange floating price risk in the future for a fixed price at the time of the hedge. Consistent with its hedging policy, the Company has entered into a series of derivative instruments to hedge a significant portion of its expected oil and natural gas production through December 31, 2021. Typically, these derivative instruments require payments to (receipts from) counterparties based on specific indices as required by the derivative agreements. Although not risk free, the Company believes these instruments reduce its exposure to oil and natural gas price fluctuations and, thereby, allow the Company to achieve a more predictable cash flow.\nThe Company\u2019s derivative instruments are cash flow hedge transactions in which it is hedging the variability of cash flow related to a forecasted transaction. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. These transactions are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815. The Company has accounted for these transactions using the mark-to-market accounting method. Generally, the Company incurs accounting losses on derivatives during periods where prices are rising and gains during periods where prices are falling which may cause significant fluctuations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company nets its derivative instrument fair value amounts executed with each counterparty pursuant to an International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreement (\u201cISDA\u201d), which provides for net settlement over the term of the contract. The ISDA is a standard contract that governs all derivative contracts entered into between the Company and the respective counterparty. The ISDA allows for offsetting of amounts payable or receivable between the Company and the counterparty, at the election of both parties, for transactions that occur on the same date and in the same currency.\nThe following table sets forth the Company\u2019s outstanding derivative contracts at December 31, 2020. When aggregating multiple contracts, the weighted average contract price is disclosed.\n(1)The basis differential price is between WTI Midland Argus Crude and the WTI NYMEX.\n(2)The basis differential price is between W. Texas (WAHA) and the Henry Hub NYMEX.\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe following table summarizes the location and fair value amounts of all derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as well as the gross recognized derivative assets, liabilities, and amounts offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):\nThe follow table summarizes the location and amounts of the Company\u2019s realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives instruments in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):\nNote 7. Oil and Natural Gas Properties\nThe Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, costs to acquire oil and natural gas properties, drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves, and drill and equip development wells are capitalized. Exploration costs, including unsuccessful exploratory wells and geological and geophysical costs, are charged to operations as incurred. Upon sale or retirement of oil and natural gas properties, the costs and related accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized.\nCosts incurred to maintain wells and related equipment, lease and well operating costs, and other exploration costs are charged to expense as incurred. Gains and losses arising from the sale of properties are included in operating income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company\u2019s lease acquisition costs and development costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are amortized using the units-of-production method, at the field level, based on total proved reserves and proved developed reserves, respectively. Depletion expense for oil and natural gas producing property and related equipment was $95.9 million and $68.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nProved Oil and Natural Gas Properties\nProved oil and natural gas properties are reviewed for impairment on a nonrecurring basis. The impairment charge reduces the carrying values to their estimated fair values. These fair value measurements are classified as Level 3 measurements and include many unobservable inputs. Fair value is calculated as the estimated discounted future net cash flows attributable to the assets. The Company\u2019s primary assumptions in preparing the estimated discounted future net cash flows to be recovered from oil and natural gas properties are based on (i) proved reserves, (ii) forward commodity prices and assumptions as to costs and\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nexpenses, and (iii) the estimated discount rate that would be used by potential purchasers to determine the fair value of the assets.\nUnproved Oil and Natural Gas Properties\nUnproved properties consist of costs incurred to acquire undeveloped leases as well as the cost to acquire unproved reserves. Undeveloped lease costs and unproved reserve acquisition costs are capitalized. Unproved oil and natural gas leases are generally for a primary term of three to five years. In most cases, the term of the unproved leases can be extended by paying delay rentals, meeting contractual drilling obligations, or by the presence of producing wells on the leases. Unproved costs related to successful exploratory drilling are reclassified to proved properties and depleted on a units-of-production basis.\nThe Company reviews its unproved properties periodically for impairment. In determining whether an unproved property is impaired, the Company considers numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration and development plans, favorable or unfavorable exploration activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, the Company\u2019s geologists\u2019 evaluation of the property, and the remaining months in the lease term for the property.\nImpairments to Oil and Natural Gas Properties\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of the decline in crude oil price futures, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $25.3 million to its proved oil and natural gas properties and $13.2 million to its unproved oil and natural gas properties, located in the Eagle Ford Trend. As a result of certain acreage expirations, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $8.4 million to its unproved oil and natural gas properties during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe Company recorded no non-cash asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAccumulated impairments to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $168.0 million and $121.1 million, respectively.\nNote 8. Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of assets acquired over the fair value of those assets. The fair value of Goodwill is classified as a Level 3 measurement according to the fair value hierarchy defined by ASC 820. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Such test includes an assessment of qualitative and quantitative factors. If the results of such tests are such that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, goodwill is then reduced by an amount that is equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.\nA discounted future cash flow analysis of the properties to which the Goodwill was associated was performed based on commodity price futures as of March 31, 2020. The resulting fair value was lower than the net book value of the associated properties. Additionally, the Company\u2019s enterprise value, calculated as the combined market capitalization of the Company\u2019s equity and long-term debt, was lower than the book value of its assets, without allocating between the Company's two major properties, Midland properties and Eagle Ford properties. Accordingly, the entire $17.6 million balance of Goodwill was impaired on that date, resulting in no remaining amounts subject to impairment. The goodwill impairment charge is included in Impairment expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company did not have any non-cash impairment charges to Goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAccumulated impairments to Goodwill as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $36.7 million and $19.1 million, respectively.\nNote 9. Noncontrolling Interest\nEarthstone consolidates the financial results of EEH and its subsidiaries, and records a noncontrolling interest for the economic interest in Earthstone held by the members of EEH other than Earthstone and Lynden US. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents the portion of net income attributable to the economic interest in the Company held by the members of EEH other than Earthstone and Lynden US. Noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020 represents the portion of net assets of the Company attributable to the members of EEH other than Earthstone and Lynden US.\nThe following table presents the changes in noncontrolling interest for the year ended December 31, 2020:\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nNote 10. Net (Loss) Income Per Common Share\nNet (loss) income per common share-basic is calculated by dividing Net (loss) income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Net (loss) income per common share-diluted assumes the conversion of all potentially dilutive securities and is calculated by dividing Net (loss) income by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock, as defined above, outstanding plus potentially dilutive securities. Net (loss) income per common share-diluted considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities except in periods in which there is a loss because the inclusion of the potential common shares, as defined above, would have an anti-dilutive effect.\nA reconciliation of Net (loss) income per common share is as follows:\nThe Class B common stock, $0.001 par value per share of Earthstone (the \u201cClass B Common Stock\u201d), has been excluded, as its conversion would eliminate noncontrolling interest and Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest of $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 would be added back to Net (loss) income attributable to Earthstone Energy, Inc. for the years then ended, having no dilutive effect on Net (loss) income per common share attributable to Earthstone Energy, Inc.\nNote 11. Common Stock\nClass A Common Stock\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 30,343,421 and 29,421,131 shares of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, as a result of the vesting and settlement of restricted stock units under the 2014 Plan, Earthstone issued 914,905 and 736,706 shares of Class A Common Stock, respectively, of which 243,924 and 203,394 shares of Class A Common Stock, respectively, were retained as treasury stock and canceled to satisfy the related employee income tax liability.\nClass B Common Stock\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 35,009,371 and 35,260,680 shares of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding, respectively. Each share of Class B Common Stock, together with one EEH Unit, is convertible into one share of Class A Common Stock. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 251,309 and 191,498 shares, respectively, of Class B Common Stock and EEH Units were exchanged for an equal number of shares of Class A Common Stock.\nNote 12. Stock-Based Compensation\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe 2014 Plan allows, among other things, for the grant of restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, the maximum number of shares of Class A Common Stock that may be issued under the 2014 Plan was 9.4 million shares.\nEach RSU represents the contingent right to receive one share of Class A Common Stock. The holders of outstanding RSUs do not receive dividends or have voting rights prior to vesting and settlement. The Company determines the fair value of granted RSUs based on the market price of the Class A Common Stock on the date of the grant. Compensation expense for granted RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term and is net of forfeitures, as incurred. Stock-based compensation is included in General and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and is recorded with a corresponding increase in Additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe table below summarizes unvested RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2020:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, Earthstone granted 744,700 RSUs to employees and 114,400 RSUs to certain members of the Board with vesting periods ranging from 12 to 36 months. The total grant date fair value of the RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $4.4 million and $6.5 million, respectively, with a weighted average grant date fair value per share of $5.07 and $6.04, respectively. The total vesting date fair value of the RSUs that vested during 2020 and 2019 was $3.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $5.7 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested RSUs, which will be amortized over the remaining vesting periods. The weighted average remaining vesting period of the unrecognized compensation expense is 0.98 years.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, stock-based compensation related to RSUs was $5.4 million and $5.9 million, respectively.\nPerformance Units\nThe table below summarizes performance unit (\u201cPSU\u201d) activity for the year ended December 31, 2020:\nOn January 30, 2020, the Board of Directors of Earthstone (the \u201cBoard\u201d) granted 1,043,800 PSUs (the \u201c2020 PSUs\u201d) to certain officers pursuant to the 2014 Plan (the \u201c2020 Grant\u201d). The 2020 Grant was subject to the approval of an amendment to the 2014 Plan to increase the number of available shares available thereunder (the \u201c2014 Plan Amendment\u201d). The 2014 Plan Amendment was approved at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders held on June 3, 2020. The 2020 PSUs are payable in shares of Class A Common Stock based upon the achievement by the Company over a period commencing on February 1, 2020 and ending on January 31, 2023 (the \u201cPerformance Period\u201d) of certain performance criteria established by the Board.\nThe 2020 PSUs are eligible to be earned based on the annualized Total Shareholder Return (\u201cTSR\u201d) of the Class A Common Stock during a three-year period beginning on February 1, 2020. Between 0x to 2.0x of the Performance Units are eligible to be earned based on Earthstone achieving an annualized TSR based on the following pre-established goals:\nEarthstone\u2019s Annualized TSR TSR Multiplier\n23.9% or greater 2.0\n14.5% 1.0\n8.4% 0.5\nLess than 8.4% 0.0\nIn the event that greater than 1.0x of the 2020 PSUs are earned, such additional PSUs may be paid in cash rather than the issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock. Based on the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent commodity price crash, the Company believes that the target annualized TSR of 14.5% included in the 2020 PSU awards will be difficult to achieve.\nThe Company accounts for these awards as market-based awards which are valued utilizing the Monte Carlo Simulation pricing model, which calculates multiple potential outcomes for an award and establishes grant date fair value based on the most likely outcome. For the 2020 PSUs, assuming a risk-free rate of 1.4% and volatility of 62.0%, the Company calculated the weighted average grant date fair value per PSU to be $5.36.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was $6.1 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to the PSU awards which will be amortized over a weighted average period of 0.88 years.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, stock-based compensation related to the PSUs was approximately $4.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively.\nNote 13. Long-Term Debt\nCredit Agreement\nOn November 21, 2019, Earthstone, EEH (the \u201cBorrower\u201d), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d), Royal Bank of Canada, as Syndication Agent, BOKF, NA dba Bank of Texas (\u201cBOKF\u201d) as Issuing Bank with respect to Existing Letters of Credit, Truist Bank, as successor by merger to SunTrust Bank, as Documentation Agent, and the lenders party thereto (the \u201cLenders\u201d) entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), which replaced the Prior Credit Agreement (as defined below), which was terminated on November 21, 2019.\nConcurrently with the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement, the Company terminated that certain credit agreement, dated as of May 9, 2017 (the \u201cPrior Credit Agreement\u201d), by and among the Borrower, Earthstone Operating, LLC, EF Non-Op, LLC, Sabine River Energy, LLC, Earthstone Legacy Properties, LLC, Lynden USA Operating, LLC, Bold Energy III LLC (\u201cBold\u201d), Bold Operating, LLC, the guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto, and BOKF, as administrative agent.\nOn March 27, 2020, in connection with a redetermination of the borrowing base under the Credit Agreement, the borrowing base was set at $275 million, representing a 15% decrease from the previous borrowing base of $325 million.\nOn September 28, 2020, Earthstone, EEH, Wells Fargo, the guarantors party thereto, and the Lenders entered into an amendment (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement. Among other things, the Amendment decreased the borrowing base from $275 million to $240 million, increased the interest rate on outstanding borrowings by 25 to 50 basis points, increased the flexibility to finance and make acquisitions, and added certain restrictions related to dividends and distributions.\nThe next regularly scheduled redetermination of the borrowing base is on or around April 1, 2021. Subsequent redeterminations will occur on or about each November 1st and May 1st thereafter. The amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement bear annual interest rates at either (a) the adjusted LIBO Rate (as customarily defined) (the \u201cAdjusted LIBO Rate\u201d) plus 2.00% to 3.25% or (b) the sum of (i) the greatest of (A) the prime rate of Wells Fargo, (B) the federal funds rate plus \u00bd of 1.0%, and (C) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for an interest rate period of one month plus 1.0%, (ii) plus 1.00% to 2.25%, depending on the amount borrowed under the Credit Agreement. Principal amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement are due and payable in full at maturity on November 21, 2024. All of the obligations under the Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of EEH\u2019s assets. Additional payments due under the Credit Agreement include paying a commitment fee of 0.375% to 0.50% per year, depending on the amount borrowed under the Credit Agreement, to the Lenders in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. EEH is also required to pay customary letter of credit fees.\nEffective May 2020, the Company entered into certain interest rate swaps, exchanging the LIBO Rate for a fixed rate of 0.286% (the \u201cSwap\u201d). The initial notional amount of the Swap is $125 million through May 2022 and decreases to $100 million through May 2023 and $75 million through May 2024.\nThe Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, EEH\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, pay dividends and distributions or repurchase its limited liability interests, engage in mergers or consolidations, sell certain assets, sell or discount any notes receivable or accounts receivable and engage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement requires EEH to maintain the following financial covenants: a current ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 and a consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0. Consolidated leverage ratio means the ratio of (i) the aggregate debt of EEH and its consolidated subsidiaries as at the last day of the fiscal quarter to (ii) EBITDAX for the applicable period, which was calculated as EBITDAX for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on such date. The term \u201cEBITDAX\u201d means, for any period, the sum of consolidated net income for such period plus (a) the following expenses or charges to the extent deducted from consolidated net income in such period: (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation, (iv)\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\ndepletion, (v) amortization, (vi) certain distributions to employees related to the stock compensation, (vii) certain transaction related expenses, (viii) reimbursed indemnification expenses related to certain dispositions and investments, (ix) non-cash extraordinary, usual, or nonrecurring expenses or losses, (x) other non-cash charges and minus (b) to the extent included in consolidated net income in such period: (i) non-cash income, (ii) gains on asset dispositions, disposals and abandonments outside of the ordinary course of business and (iii) to the extent not otherwise deducted from consolidated net income, the aggregate amount of any pass-through cash distributions received by Borrower during such period in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of pass-through cash distributions actually made by Borrower during such period.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and defines events of default to include failure to pay principal or interest, breach of covenants, breach of representations and warranties, insolvency, judgment default and a change in control. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, the Lenders have the right to accelerate repayment of the loans and exercise their remedies with respect to the collateral. At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had a $240.0 million borrowing base under the Credit Agreement, of which $115.0 million was outstanding, bearing annual interest of 2.400%, resulting in an additional $125.0 million of borrowing base availability under the Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2019, there were $170.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had borrowings of $136.1 million and $191.1 million in repayments of borrowings.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest on all outstanding debt averaged 2.83% and 4.42% per annum, respectively, which excluded commitment fees of $0.6 million and $0.7 million for each period ended, respectively, and amortization of deferred financing costs of $0.3 million and $0.4 million for each period ended, respectively.\nNo costs associated with the Credit Agreement were capitalized during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company capitalized $1.6 million of costs associated with the Credit Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2019. These capitalized costs are included in Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company\u2019s policy is to capitalize the financing costs associated with its debt and amortize those costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the associated debt, which approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related debt.\nAmendment to the Credit Agreement\nOn December 17, 2020, Earthstone, EEH, as Borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d), as Administrative Agent, the guarantors party thereto, and the lenders party thereto (the \u201cLenders\u201d) entered into an amendment (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement. The Amendment was effective upon the closing of the acquisition described in Note 20. Subsequent Event. Among other things, the Amendment (i) joined certain financial institutions as additional lenders, increased the borrowing base from $240.0 million to $360.0 million, (ii) increased the interest rate on outstanding borrowings; and (iii) adjusted some of the financial covenants.\nNote 14. Asset Retirement Obligations\nThe Company has asset retirement obligations associated with the future plugging and abandonment of oil and natural gas properties and related facilities. Revisions to the liability typically occur due to changes in the estimated abandonment costs, well economic lives, and the discount rate.\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s asset retirement obligation transactions recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nNote 15. Related Party Transactions\nFASB ASC Topic 850, Related Party Disclosures, requires that information about transactions with related parties that would make a difference in decision making shall be disclosed so that users of the financial statements can evaluate their significance.\nEarthstone's significant shareholder consists of various investment funds managed by a private equity firm who may manage other investments in entities with which the Company interacts in the normal course of business. On February 12, 2020, the Company sold certain of its interests in oil and natural gas leases and wells in an arm\u2019s length transaction to a portfolio company of Earthstone\u2019s significant shareholder (not under common control) for cash consideration of approximately $0.4 million.\nIn connection with the Olenik v. Lodzinski et al. lawsuit described below in Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies, Earthstone\u2019s significant shareholder was also named in the lawsuit. As a result of the Settlement Agreement (defined below), the Company has concluded negotiations with its insurance carrier regarding an allocation of defense costs and settlement contributions above its deductible for all the parties named in the lawsuit.\nNote 16. Commitments and Contingencies\nContractual Commitments\nFuture minimum contractual commitments as of December 31, 2020 under non-cancelable agreements having initial or remaining terms in excess of one year are as follows:\nThe Company has a non-cancelable fixed cost agreement of $1.6 million per year through May 2021 to reserve pipeline capacity of 10,000 MMBtu per day for gathering and processing related to certain Eagle Ford assets in south Texas. As the operator of the properties dedicated to this contract, the gross amount of obligation is provided; however, the Company\u2019s net share is approximately 31%.\nAdditionally, the Company leases corporate office space in The Woodlands, Texas and Midland, Texas. Rent expense was approximately $0.8 million and $0.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Minimum lease payments under the terms of non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2020 are shown in the table above.\nEnvironmental\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to risks normally associated with the drilling, completion and production of oil and gas, including blowouts, fires, and environmental risks such as oil spills or gas leaks that could expose the Company to liabilities associated with these risks.\nIn the Company\u2019s acquisition of existing or previously drilled well bores, the Company may not be aware of prior environmental safeguards, if any, that were taken at the time such wells were drilled or during such time the wells were operated. The Company maintains comprehensive insurance coverage that it believes is adequate to mitigate the risk of any adverse financial effects associated with these risks.\nHowever, should it be determined that a liability exists with respect to any environmental cleanup or restoration, the liability to cure such a violation could still fall upon the Company. No claim has been made, nor is the Company aware of any liability which the Company may have, as it relates to any environmental cleanup, restoration, or the violation of any rules or regulations relating thereto except for the matter discussed above.\nLegal\nFrom time to time, Earthstone and its subsidiaries may be involved in various legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business.\nOlenik v. Lodzinski et al.: On June 2, 2017, Nicholas Olenik filed a purported shareholder class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Earthstone\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, along with other members of the Board, EnCap Investments L.P. (\u201cEnCap\u201d), Bold, Bold Holdings and Oak Valley Resources, LLC. The complaint alleges that Earthstone\u2019s directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the contribution agreement dated as of November 7, 2016 and as amended on March 21, 2017 (the \u201cBold Contribution Agreement\u201d), by and among Earthstone, EEH, Lynden US, Lynden USA Operating, LLC, Bold Holdings and Bold. The Plaintiff asserts that the directors negotiated the business combination pursuant\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nto the Bold Contribution Agreement (the \u201cBold Transaction\u201d) to benefit EnCap and its affiliates, failed to obtain adequate consideration for the Earthstone shareholders who were not affiliated with EnCap or Earthstone management, did not follow an adequate process in negotiating and approving the Bold Transaction and made materially misleading or incomplete proxy disclosures in connection with the Bold Transaction. The suit seeks unspecified damages and purports to assert claims derivatively on behalf of Earthstone and as a class action on behalf of all persons who held common stock up to March 13, 2017, excluding defendants and their affiliates. On July 20, 2018, the Delaware Court of Chancery granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and entered an order dismissing the action in its entirety with prejudice. The Plaintiff filed an appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court. On April 5, 2019, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s dismissal of the proxy disclosure claims but reversed the Delaware Court of Chancery\u2019s dismissal of the other claims, holding that the allegations with respect to those claims were sufficient for pleading purposes. After engaging in extensive pre-trial discovery, the parties engaged in a mediation process that resulted in a non-binding settlement term sheet on September 21, 2020. On January 4, 2021, the parties executed and filed a Stipulation of Settlement (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d) with the Delaware Court of Chancery. The principal terms of the Settlement Agreement are as follows: (i) a $3.5 million all-in cash settlement payment (the \u201cFund\u201d) to be funded by defendants and/or their insurers into an escrow account, (ii) a bi-lateral complete and full release of all claims against defendants and plaintiffs, and (iii) that 55% of the Fund (the derivative payment) be paid to Earthstone to be used as determined by management, according to their fiduciary duties and business judgment, 45% of the Fund (the class payment) be paid to members of the class or current stockholders of Earthstone. The Company expects court approval of the Settlement Agreement and in addition estimates the insurance carriers and related affiliates to reimburse the Company in the amount of $2.8 million and $0.1 million, respectively. There is no assurance, however, that the court will approve the settlement. As described above, the Company expects to receive a portion of the derivative payment, however, the amount cannot be reasonably determined at this time.\nThrough December 31, 2020, due to uncertainty of reimbursement, the Company recorded and accrued litigation costs when incurred and recorded insurance reimbursements as an offset only when proceeds were received in Transactions costs. In light of the Settlement Agreement, insurance carrier agreement on allocation of defense costs and settlement payment combined with the history of reimbursements from insurance carriers and related affiliate, a high probability of reimbursement exists. Accordingly, the Company has accrued $3.5 million related to the Settlement Agreement and estimated final defense costs associated with this legal action included in Accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, offset by an accrued $3.1 million of estimated reimbursements from insurance carriers and the majority shareholder which are included in Accounts receivable: Joint interest billings and other, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the impact of both items included in Transaction costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNote 17. Income Taxes\nThe Company\u2019s corporate structure requires the filing of two separate consolidated U.S. Federal income tax returns and one Canadian income tax return which include Lynden US, Earthstone, and Lynden Corp. As such, taxable income of Earthstone cannot be offset by tax attributes, including net operating losses, of Lynden US, nor can taxable income of Lynden US be offset by tax attributes of Earthstone. Earthstone and Lynden US record a tax provision, respectively, for their share of the book income or loss of EEH, net of the non-controlling interest. As EEH is treated as a partnership for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, it is not subject to income tax at the federal level and only recognizes the Texas Margin Tax.\nThe following table shows the components of the Company\u2019s income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nEffective Tax Rate\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nA reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the statutory rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded total income tax benefit of $0.11 million which included (1) deferred income tax benefit for Lynden US of $0.15 million as a result of its share of the distributable income from EEH, (2) deferred income tax benefit for Earthstone of $0.61 million as a result of its share of the distributable loss from EEH, which was offset by a valuation allowance as future realization of the net deferred tax asset cannot be assured and (3) current income tax expense of $0.55 million, offset by deferred income tax benefit of $0.51 million related to the Texas Margin Tax. Lynden Corp incurred no material income or loss, or related income tax expense or benefit, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded total income tax expense of $1.7 million which included (1) deferred income tax expense for Lynden US of $0.1 million as a result of its share of the distributable income from EEH, (2) deferred income tax expense for Earthstone of $0.4 million as a result of its share of the distributable income from EEH, which was used to reduce the valuation allowance recorded against its deferred tax asset as future realization of the net deferred tax asset cannot be assured and (3) deferred income tax expense of $1.6 million related to the Texas Margin Tax. Lynden Corp incurred no material income or loss, or related income tax expense or benefit, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company\u2019s deferred tax position reflects the net tax effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting. Significant components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had a valuation allowance recorded against its deferred tax assets of $17.0 million which is in excess of its net deferred noncurrent tax assets of $2.5 million, as presented above. The Company\u2019s corporate organizational structure requires the filing of two separate consolidated U.S. Federal corporate income tax returns, one separate U.S. Federal partnership income tax return and one Canadian income tax return. As a result, tax attributes of one group cannot be offset by the tax attributes of another. At December 31, 2020, the deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the two U.S.\nEARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nFederal corporate income tax returns, one Canadian income tax return and one related to the Texas Margin Tax are a $13.3 million deferred tax asset, a $9.6 million deferred tax liability, a $3.8 million deferred tax asset and a $4.8 million deferred tax liability, respectively, before considering the valuation allowance of $17.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had a valuation allowance recorded against its deferred tax assets of $16.5 million which is in excess of its Net deferred noncurrent tax assets of $1.3 million, as presented above. The Company\u2019s corporate organizational structure requires the filing of two separate consolidated U.S. Federal income tax returns, one separate U.S. Federal partnership income tax return and one Canadian income tax return. As a result, tax attributes of one group cannot be offset by the tax attributes of another. At December 31, 2019, the deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the two U.S. Federal income tax returns, one Canadian income tax and one related to the Texas Margin Tax were a $12.7 million deferred tax asset, a $9.7 million deferred tax liability, a $3.8 million deferred tax asset and a $5.5 million deferred tax liability, respectively, before considering the valuation allowance of $16.5 million.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had estimated U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $42.4 million, the first expiring in 2034 and the last in 2040, and estimated Canadian net operating loss carryforwards of $10.0 million, the first expiring in 2024 and the last in 2037. The ability to utilize net operating losses and other tax attributes could be subject to a significant limitation if the Company were to undergo an ownership change for the purposes of Section 382 (\u201cSec 382\u201d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The Company has an additional estimated U.S. net operating loss carryforward of $28.2 million limited by Sec 382 resulting from the Lynden Arrangement. The Company continues to evaluate the impact, if any, of potential Sec 382 limitations.\nThe Company\u2019s tax returns are subject to periodic audits by the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. These audits can result in adjustments of taxes due or adjustments of the NOL carryforwards that are available to offset future taxable income. Generally, the Company\u2019s income tax years 2014 through 2019 remain open and subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax jurisdictions where it conducts operations. In certain jurisdictions, the Company operates through more than one legal entity, each of which may have different open years subject to examination.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nFASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (\u201cASC 740\u201d) prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, an income tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no material uncertain tax positions. The Company\u2019s uncertain tax positions may change in the next twelve months; however, the Company does not expect any possible change to have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position.\nThe Company files two Federal income tax returns, one Canadian income tax return and various combined and separate filings in several state and local jurisdictions. The Company\u2019s practice is to recognize estimated interest and penalties, if any, related to potential underpayment of income taxes as a component of income tax expense in its Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with any uncertain tax liabilities.\nNote 18. Defined Contribution Plan\nThe Company sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan (the \u201c401(k) Plan\u201d) for substantially all of its employees, which was initiated in April 2017. Eligible employees may make contributions to the 401(k) Plan by electing to contribute up to 100% of their annual compensation, not to exceed annual limits established by the federal government. The Company makes matching contributions of 100% of employee contributions, not to exceed six percent of the employee\u2019s annual eligible compensation. The Company\u2019s matching contributions vest immediately. The Company\u2019s contributions to the 401(k) Plan for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $0.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively.\nNote 19. Leases\nThe Company\u2019s operating lease activities consist of leases for office space. The Company\u2019s finance lease activities consist of leases for vehicles. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms generally ranging from one to three years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company\u2019s sole discretion. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. None of the lease agreements include variable lease payments. The lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nThe following table shows the classification and location of the Company\u2019s leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):\nThe following table shows the classification and location of the Company\u2019s lease costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations (in thousands):\nAdditionally, the Company capitalized as part of oil and gas properties $2.9 million and $11.4 million of short-term lease costs related to drilling rig contracts during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. All of the Company\u2019s drilling rig contracts have enforceable terms of less than one year.\nMinimum contractual obligations for the Company\u2019s leases (undiscounted) as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\nThe following table shows the weighted average remaining lease term and the weighted average discount rate for the Company\u2019s leases:\n(1)The discount rate used for operating leases is based on the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement and may be adjusted if modifications to lease terms or lease reassessments occur. The discount rate used for finance leases is based on the rates implicit in the leases.\nThe following table includes other quantitative information for the Company\u2019s leases (in thousands):\nNote 20. Subsequent Event\nMidland Basin Acquisition\nOn January 7, 2021, Earthstone, Earthstone Energy Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company (\u201cEEH\u201d and collectively with Earthstone, the \u201cBuyer\u201d), Independence Resources Holdings, LLC (\u201cIndependence\u201d), and Independence Resources Manager, LLC (\u201cIndependence Manager\u201d and collectively with Independence, the \u201cSeller\u201d) consummated the transactions contemplated in a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated December 17, 2020 (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d). The Seller was unaffiliated with the Company. At the closing of the Purchase Agreement, among other things, EEH acquired (the \u201cIRM Acquisition\u201d) all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Independence and Independence Manager (collectively, the \u201cAcquired Entities\u201d) for aggregate consideration consisting of the following: (i) an aggregate amount of cash from EEH equal to approximately $131.2 million (the \u201cCash Consideration\u201d) and (ii) 12,719,594 shares of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock issued to Independence.\nAcquisition costs of $1.0 million related to the IRM Acquisition are included in Transaction costs in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination, with the fair value of consideration allocated to the acquisition date fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. The Company\u2019s post-acquisition date results of operations of the Acquired Entities will be incorporated into the Company's interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2021.\nNote 21. Supplemental Information On Oil And Gas Exploration And Production Activities (Unaudited)\nCosts Incurred Related to Oil and Gas Activities\nCapitalized costs include the cost of properties, equipment, and facilities for oil and natural gas producing activities. Capitalized costs for proved properties include costs for oil and natural gas leaseholds where proved reserves have been identified, development wells, and related equipment and facilities, including development wells in progress. Capitalized costs for unproved properties include costs for acquiring oil and natural gas leaseholds where no proved reserves have been identified, including costs of exploratory wells that are in the process of drilling or in active completion, and costs of exploratory wells suspended or waiting on completion.\nThe Company\u2019s oil and natural gas activities for 2020 and 2019 were entirely within the United States of America. Costs incurred in oil and natural gas producing activities were as follows (in thousands):\n(1)Acquisition costs incurred during 2019 consisted primarily of purchase price adjustments related to 2018 acquisitions.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, additions to oil and natural gas properties of $0.8 million and $0.1 million, respectively, were recorded for estimated costs of future abandonment related to new wells drilled or acquired.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no capitalized exploratory well costs, nor costs related to share-based compensation, general corporate overhead or similar activities.\nCapitalized Costs\nCapitalized costs, impairment, and depreciation, depletion and amortization relating to the Company\u2019s oil and natural gas properties producing activities, all of which are conducted within the continental United States as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, are summarized below (in thousands):\nOil and Natural Gas Reserves\nUsers of this information should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of \u201cproved\u201d and \u201cproved developed\u201d oil and natural gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. As a result, revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various reservoirs make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures.\nProved reserves represent estimated quantities of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions in effect when the estimates were made. Proved developed reserves represent estimated quantities expected to be recovered through wells and equipment in place and under operating methods used when the estimates were made.\nThe proved reserves estimates shown herein for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 have been prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc., independent petroleum engineers. Proved reserves were estimated in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC, which require that reserve estimates be prepared under existing economic and operating conditions based upon the 12-month unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month prices.\nThe reserve information in these Consolidated Financial Statements represents only estimates. There are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as commodity pricing. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates by different engineers may vary. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may lead to revising the original estimate. Accordingly, initial reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. The meaningfulness of such estimates depends primarily on the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. Except to the extent the Company acquires additional properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful exploration and development activities or both, the Company\u2019s proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced.\nThe following table illustrates the Company\u2019s estimated net proved reserves, including changes, and proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves for the periods indicated. The oil prices as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are based on the\nrespective 12-month unweighted average of the first of the month prices of the West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) spot prices which equates to $39.57 per barrel and $55.69 per barrel, respectively. The natural gas prices as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are based on the respective 12-month unweighted average of the first of month prices of the Henry Hub spot price which equates to $1.99 per MMBtu and $2.58 per MMBtu, respectively. Natural gas liquids are made up of ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline, each of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics. The natural gas liquids prices used to value reserves as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 averaged $11.61 per barrel and $16.17 per barrel, respectively. All prices are adjusted by lease or field for energy content, transportation fees, and market differentials, resulting in the aforementioned oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves as of December 31, 2020 being valued using prices of $38.90 per barrel, $0.97 per MMBtu and $11.61 per barrel, respectively. All prices are held constant in accordance with SEC guidelines.\nA summary of the Company\u2019s changes in quantities of proved oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nThe table below presents the quantities of proved oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves attributable to noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nNotable changes in proved reserves for the year ended December 31, 2020 included the following:\n\u2022Extensions and discoveries. In 2020, total extensions and discoveries of 860.0 MBOE was the result of successful drilling results and well performance primarily related to the Midland Basin.\n\u2022Revision to previous estimates. In 2020, the downward revisions of prior reserves of 10.7 MMBOE were primarily due to negative revisions due to price which included the reclassification of 11.9 MMBOE of reserves from proved undeveloped to non-proved due to the five-year development rule.\nNotable changes in proved reserves for the year ended December 31, 2019 included the following:\n\u2022Extensions and discoveries. In 2019, total extensions and discoveries of 5.1 MMBOE was a result of successful drilling results and well performance primarily related to the Midland Basin.\n\u2022Sales of minerals in place. Sales of minerals in place totaled 32.0 MBOE during 2019, resulting from the disposition of certain non-operated properties in the Midland Basin. See Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures.\n\u2022Revision to previous estimates. In 2019, the downward revisions of prior reserves of 4.6 MMBOE were primarily due to reduced commodity prices.\nFor wells classified as proved developed producing where sufficient production history existed, reserves were based on individual well performance evaluation and production decline curve extrapolation techniques. For undeveloped locations and wells that lack sufficient production history, reserves were based on analogy to producing wells within the same area exhibiting similar geologic and reservoir characteristics. Well spacing was determined from drainage patterns derived from a combination of performance-based recoveries and analogous producing wells for each area or field. PUD locations were limited to areas of uniformly high-quality reservoir properties, between existing commercial producers where the reservoir can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with existing producers and contain economically producible oil and natural gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.\nChanges in PUD reserves for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in MBOE):\n(1)Includes 41,560 MBOE attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n(2)Includes 34,243 MBOE attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n(3)Includes 21,737 MBOE attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n2020 Changes in Proved Undeveloped Reserves\nConversions to developed. In our year-end 2019 plan to develop its PUDs within five years, we estimated that $111.1 million of capital would be expended in 2020 for the conversion of 28 gross / 17.6 net PUDs to add 11.3 MMBOE. In 2020, due to unforeseeable conditions previously described, we spent $67.8 million to convert 18 gross / 10.3 net PUDs adding 8.2 MMBOE to developed.\nRevision to previous estimates. We maintain a five-year development plan, reviewed annually to ensure capital is allocated to the wells that have the highest risk-adjusted rates of return within our inventory of undrilled well locations. In response to lower commodity prices, we reduced the pace of activity in our five-year development plan. This resulted in the reclassification of 11.9 MMBOE of reserves from proved undeveloped to non-proved during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the five-year development rule. Based on our then-current acreage position, strip prices, anticipated well economics, and our development plans at the time these reserves were classified as proved, we believe the previous classification of these locations as proved undeveloped was appropriate. The remaining revisions of 2.1 MMBOE were primarily due to reduced commodity prices.\n2019 Changes in Proved Undeveloped Reserves\nConversions to developed. In the Company\u2019s year-end 2018 plan to develop its PUDs within five years, the Company estimated that $103.8 million of capital would be expended in 2019 for the conversion of 30 gross / 12.30 net PUDs to add 9.9 MMBOE,\nwhich was consistent with the $111.5 million actually spent to convert 32 gross / 13.4 net PUDs adding 10.3 MMBOE to developed.\nExtensions and discoveries. Additionally, 1.2 MMBOE were added as extensions and discoveries due to successful drilling results on the Company\u2019s acreage positions because of the wells it drilled. The increase was also supported by successful drilling results by other operators directly offsetting and in close proximity to the Company\u2019s acreage.\nRevision to previous estimates. Revisions of 3.4 MMBOE were primarily due to reduced commodity prices.\nStandardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves\nThe following Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (Standardized Measure) has been developed utilizing FASB ASC Topic 932, Extractives Activities - Oil and Gas (\u201cASC 932\u201d) procedures and based on oil and natural gas reserve and production volumes estimated by the Company\u2019s third-party petroleum engineering firm. It can be used for some comparisons, but should not be the only method used to evaluate the Company or its performance. Further, the information in the following table may not represent realistic assessments of future cash flows, nor should the Standardized Measure be viewed as representative of the current value of the Company.\nThe Company believes that the following factors should be taken into account when reviewing the following information:\n\u2022Future costs and commodity prices will probably differ from those required to be used in these calculations;\n\u2022Due to future market conditions and governmental regulations, actual rates of production in future years may vary significantly from the rate of production assumed in the calculations;\n\u2022A 10% discount rate may not be reasonable as a measure of the relative risk inherent in realizing future net oil and natural gas revenues; and\n\u2022Future net revenues may be subject to different rates of income taxation.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, as specified by the SEC, the prices for oil and natural gas used in this calculation were the unweighted 12-month average of the first day of the month prices, except for volumes subject to fixed price contracts. Prices used to estimate reserves are included in Oil and Natural Gas Reserves above. Future production costs include per-well overhead expenses allowed under joint operating agreements, abandonment costs (net of salvage value), and a non-cancelable fixed cost agreement to reserve pipeline capacity of 10,000 MMBtu per day for gathering and processing. Estimates of future income taxes are computed using current statutory income tax rates including consideration for estimated future statutory depletion and tax credits. The resulting net cash flows are reduced to present value amounts by applying a 10% discount factor.\nThe Standardized Measure is as follows (in thousands):\n(1)At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the portion of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows attributable to noncontrolling interests was $246.9 million and $430.4 million, respectively.\nChanges in Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves\nThe following is a summary of the changes in the Standardized Measure for the Company\u2019s proved oil and natural gas reserves during each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\n(1)At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the portion of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows attributable to noncontrolling interests was $246.9 million and $430.4 million, respectively."
