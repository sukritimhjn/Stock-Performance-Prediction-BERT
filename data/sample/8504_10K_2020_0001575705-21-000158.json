    "item_1": "ITEM 1.\nBUSINESS\nOverview\nAgEagle\u2122 Aerial Systems Inc. (\u201cAgEagle,\u201d \u201cthe Company,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d) produces, supports and operates technologically advanced drone systems and solutions for the fast-emerging unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) industry. We are engaged in delivering the metrics, tools and strategies necessary to invent and implement drone-enabled solutions that solve important problems for our valued customers. With our founding premise rooted in high performance, next-level thinking, and technological innovation, AgEagle is intent on ensuring that standards for quality U.S. manufacturing and the provision of precision-crafted, purpose-built drone systems and solutions are delivered to empower our customers to thrive and prosper in The Drone Age\u2122.\nFounded in 2010, AgEagle was originally formed to pioneer proprietary, professional-grade, fixed-wing drones and aerial imagery-based data collection and analytics solutions for the agriculture industry. In addition to selling our innovative drones to the precision and sustainable farming markets, AgEagle\u2019s innovative data collection and analytics solutions have processed more than two million acres of crops, analyzing data from over 50 countries and 53 difference crop types, and creating more than 11,000 crop reports for its users. AgEagle remains intent on earning distinction as a trusted partner to clients seeking to adopt and support productive agricultural approaches to improve farming practices which currently limit the impact on our natural resources, reduce reliance on inputs and materially increase crop yields and profits.\nIn the first half of 2019, the Company introduced HempOverview, a scalable, responsive and cost-effective Software-as-a-Solution (\u201cSaaS\u201d) web- and map-based technology platform to support the operations of domestic industrial hemp programs for state and tribal nation departments of agriculture - a solution that provides users with what the Company believes is the gold standard for regulatory oversight, operational assistance and reporting capabilities for the fast emerging industrial hemp industry.\nOver the past decade, the broader drone market has continued to evolve and expand. As a result, economic and productivity benefits made possible by drones is fueling global demand for high quality, safe and reliable drone systems and solutions for commercial applications well beyond agriculture. In response, AgEagle is now leveraging our technological expertise and drone engineering and manufacturing experience to penetrate new, high growth market sectors; namely, drone package delivery, public safety/security, large venue decontamination and infrastructure/inspection, among other high growth market opportunities.\nAgEagle\u2019s key growth objectives are centered on three primary areas of focus:\n1) Ag Solutions: Leveraging our reputation as one of the leading technology solutions providers to the agriculture industry to increase market share through delivery of best-in-class drones, sensors and data analytics for hemp and other commercial crops;\n2) Drone Manufacturing: Establishing AgEagle as the dominant commercial drone design, engineering, manufacturing, assembly and testing company in the United States; and\n3) Drone Solutions: Establishing the Company as one of the industry\u2019s leading American-made trusted source for turnkey, end-to-end, tailored drone solutions to the world.\nWe intend to grow our business by preserving a leadership position in our core Ag Solutions business; providing quality contract manufacturing, assembly and testing services; and innovating new customer-focused drone systems and solutions to capture significant share of the broader commercial drone market. In addition, we expect to accelerate our growth and expansion through strategic acquisitions of drone-related companies offering distinct technological and competitive advantages and have defensible IP protection in place, if applicable.\nAg Solutions\nAccording to a report published in August 2020 by industry research firm Markets and Markets (Agriculture Drones Market with COVID-19 Impact Analysis, by Application (Precision Farming, Livestock Monitoring), Offering, Farming Environment, Farm Produce, Component and Geography - Global Forecast to 2025), the agriculture drones market is expected to grow from $1.2 billion in 2020 to $5.7 billion by 2025 at a CAGR of 35.9% over the forecasted period. The report covered drone hardware, software and services and included AgEagle as one of the key market players.\nDrone Leasing\nIn addition to UAV sales, AgEagle also offers a drone leasing program, alleviating farmers and agribusinesses from significant upfront costs associated with purchasing a drone, while also relieving them from ongoing drone maintenance and support requirements. Additionally, the program provides the option of engaging a trained AgEagle pilot to operate the drone and manage the entire image collection process, creating a truly turnkey aerial imagery capture solution for the Company\u2019s customers.\nFarmLens\u2122 Platform\nIn 2018, we acquired FarmLens, a subscription cloud analytics service that processes data, primarily collected with a drone, such as those produced by AgEagle, and makes such data actionable by farmers and agronomists. Our user-friendly FarmLens solution can easily and quickly stitch virtually thousands of high-resolution, multispectral images together to produce detailed prescription maps for everything from disease and pest infestations to weather impact and improper irrigation - all before these issues can be detected by the naked eye and at materially lower costs than satellite imagery or manned aircraft flyovers.\nUsed as a PC-based system or on any mobile device, FarmLens helps users save time and eliminates technological hassles and costly computing requirements. The FarmLens platform has benefitted us and our shareholders by allowing us to develop important vertically integrated products and services with our drone-enabled software technologies. FarmLens is currently sold by AgEagle as a subscription service and offered either standalone or in a bundle with drone platforms manufactured by leading drone providers like AgEagle, DJI and senseFly. The FarmLens platform extends AgEagle\u2019s reach as a business through key industry partnerships.\nHempOverview Platform\nDomestic Hemp Production and Prevailing Regulatory Changes\nWith the passing of the 2018 Farm Bill in December 2018, industrial hemp is now recognized as an agricultural commodity, such as corn, wheat, or soybeans.\nMore specifically, the 2018 Farm Bill authorizes state departments of agriculture, including agencies representing the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and any other territory or possession of the United States, and Indian tribal governments, to submit plans to the USDA applying for primary regulatory authority over the production of hemp in their respective state or tribal territory. For more information on state and tribal nation plan submission, please visit https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/hemp/state-and-tribal-plan-review.\nAs of February 12, 2021, 23 states and 40 tribal nations have had their hemp production plans approved by the USDA, and 20 states will continue to operate their hemp production plans in accordance with the 2014 pilot guidelines issued by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which handles the extramural research aspects of industrial hemp cultivation.\nMarket Opportunity in U.S. Industrial Hemp and Hemp-Derived CBD\nAfter a tumultuous first two years of legal hemp farming in the United States, many market participants are anticipating that the 2021 planting season will take on a more settled character, bringing some routine and less confusion to growing, harvesting and marketing efforts. In its January 2021 report titled Hemp 2021: Industry Insiders Offer Projections for the Year, Hemp Benchmark noted that some industry leaders believe this year could be a strong one for hemp as the crop becomes more integrated into the workings of America\u2019s agriculture sector.\nIn its February 2020 market forecast report (https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-industrial- hemp-market), Grand View Research stated that the global industrial hemp market will reach $15.26 billion by 2027, up from $5.33 billion in 2020. According to the report, an increased focus on selecting low-THC hemp varieties, using developed cultivation and processing equipment, providing technical support for growers, and establishing contracts with farmers, all play significant roles in achieving major market share. Grand View expects that increased awareness of the dietary advantages of hemp oil and growing demand for hemp-derived CBD from the cosmetics and personal care industries will help fuel market growth, along with the introduction of conducive regulations for the cultivation and use of hemp-based CBD products in the United States over the forecast period.\nHempOverview\nAs one of the agriculture industry\u2019s leading pioneers of advanced aerial-image-based data collection and analytics solutions, AgEagle is intent on leveraging our expertise to champion the use of proven, advanced web- and map-based technologies as a means to streamline and ultimately standardize hemp cultivation in the United States. Growers need to be registered/permitted; crops need to be monitored and inspected; and enforcement operations must be established to ensure compliance with state and federal mandates. Through the introduction of HempOverview, we believe that AgEagle represents the first agriculture technology company to bring to market an advanced agtech solution that is designed to meet the unique complexities and vigorous oversight, compliance and enforcement demands of the emerging American hemp industry and the unique needs and demands of its key stakeholders.\nHempOverview is comprised of four modules:\n1) Registration: secure, scalable software to handle all farmer and processer application and licensing matters.\n2) Best Management Practices: iterative, intelligent data collection and analysis utilizing satellite imagery and advanced, proprietary algorithms to help farmers reduce input costs, avoid missteps, detect pest impacts and monitor water usage.\n3) Oversight and Enforcement: integration of data management and satellite imagery to provide continuous monitoring of all hemp fields in the state, predict and respond to issues and assist in proper crop testing.\n4) Reporting: generation of actionable reports for USDA requirements, legislative oversight and support of research institutions.\nIn November 2019, AgEagle announced that the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services chose the HempOverview solution to manage its online application submission and registration process for hemp growers and their farms and hemp fields in the State of Florida for the years 2020, 2021 and 2022. Subsequent to the end of 2020, the Company announced that the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship also licensed the HempOverview platform to manage the state\u2019s online registration, payment processing, comprehensive data collection and compliance oversight for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 planting seasons.\nHempOverview has also been created to support hemp processors who contract with growers, helping to ensure profitable production on existing contracted acres while maintaining governmental compliance in a changing regulatory landscape. More specifically, HempOverview supports full, cloud-based mobile- and desktop-based software application and enables users to:\n\u25cf Maintain oversight of the supply chain for a processor\u2019s contracted acres in order to avoid costly errors resulting in lost crop(s) and/or inefficient production downtime;\n\u25cf Create metrics and regularly evaluate contracted acres, in near real-time, using a variety of data structures, including remote sensing, in-field monitoring, harvest estimation and comprehensive reporting functions;\n\u25cf Advise contract farmers on planting, fertilization, irrigation and harvest schedules with the goal of producing a \u201cgold standard\u201d hemp crop; and\n\u25cf Establish best practices, maintain compliance and properly file all registration documents and amendments with respective state regulatory bodies.\nHempOverview focuses on simultaneously collecting data, analyzing field-related problems, and providing readily accessible analysis and reporting for achieving and sustaining end-to-end visibility and best management practices for the growing industrial and CBD hemp supply chain.\nDrone Manufacturing\nOur Proprietary Fixed-Wing Drones\nThe Company\u2019s first commercially available product was the AgEagle Classic, which was followed shortly thereafter by the RAPID System. As we improved and evolved our product, we launched the RX-60 and subsequently our current UAV product, the RX-48. The success AgEagle has achieved with its legacy products, which the Company believes has carried over into the continued improvement of the RX-60 and RX-48, stems from AgEagle\u2019s ability to invent and deliver advanced solutions utilizing its proprietary technologies and trade secrets that help farmers, agronomists and other precision agricultural professionals operate more effectively and efficiently.\nThe Company\u2019s core technological capabilities, developed over five years of research and innovation, include a lightweight laminated shell that allows the UAV platform to perform under challenging flying conditions, a camera with a Near Infrared (NIR) filter, a rugged foot launcher (RX-60), and high-end software that automates drone flights and provides geo-referenced data. AgEagle\u2019s products were designed for busy agriculture professionals who do not have the time to process images on their computers, which some of its competitors require. The software can automatically take pictures from the camera, stitch the photos together through the cloud, and deliver a geo-referenced, high quality aerial map to the user\u2019s desktop or tablet device using specialty precision agriculture software such as SST Software, SMS Software or most other agricultural software solutions. The result is a prescription or zone map that can then be used in a field computer that is typically found in a sprayer or applicator designed to drive through fields to precisely apply the amount of nutrients or chemicals required to continue or restore the production of healthy crops. The Company\u2019s management believes that these characteristics make its UAVs well suited for providing a complete aerial view of a farmer\u2019s field to help precisely identify crop health and field conditions faster than any other method available.\nRelocation to Wichita\nIn November 2020, AgEagle relocated its headquarters and drone manufacturing and assembly operations from Neodesha, Kansas to Wichita, Kansas, widely known as the \u201cAir Capital of the World.\u201d Home to several of the world\u2019s great aviation brands, Wichita was ranked by Brookings Institution (source: https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/ uploads/2016/07/Wichita-2.pdf) as having the #1 skilled workforce in the nation, providing us with direct access to world class engineering and aeronautical talent. In addition, the decision to move to Wichita was further buoyed by the region\u2019s low-cost real estate advantages and high quality of life for our workforce.\nOur newly leased 12,000 square foot facility provides AgEagle with ample capacity to materially scale our contract manufacturing business, while also providing the space necessary to house our administrative offices, design and engineering teams and testing operations.\nDemand for Drones \u201cMade in America\u201d\nFor the past several years, security experts have expressed concerns that UAVs made in China or other adversarial countries could be used to spy on U.S. interest by exfiltration of data back to the country of origin. In fact, in May 2019, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert that drones are a potential risk to an organization\u2019s information.\nData released by Drone Industry Insights in late 2019 revealed that China-based Da Jiang Innovations (DJI) accounted for about 70% of all drone sales worldwide - and up to 80% of the U.S. market (Source: https://droneii.com/product/chinese- drone-market-report). Citing the threat of Chinese manufacturers, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) announced in January 2021 that it will no longer include drones in its suite of offerings as of February 1, 2021 (Source: https://interact.gsa.gov/blog/removal-drones-gsa-multiple-award-schedule-contracts). The Department of Justice also recently banned the use of agency grants to purchase drones and other unmanned aerial systems from foreign groups; and the federal government is not likely to stop these limited policy bans. Congress has already taken steps to check DJI\u2019s ability to operate in the U.S. and it is considering more. It effectively cemented the Defense Department\u2019s ban into law in the National Defense Authorization Act for 2020. Congress has also considered broader bans, such as the draft American Security Drone Act, which would bar any federal agency from acquiring Chinese drones or drones made with Chinese components; and would also codify the different policy prohibitions on using federal grant money to buy Chinese drones and components - an aspect of the law clearly aimed at curbing use of the technology at the state and local levels.\nAgEagle believes that these measures to ban China-manufactured drones and components has and will continue to fuel demand for \u201cMade in America\u201d drones and components, creating a significant opportunity for U.S.-based drone manufacturers, like AgEagle. Consequently, it is our intention to establish best industry practices and define quality standards for manufacturing, assembly, design/engineering and testing of drones, drone subcomponents and related drone equipment in our Wichita facility.\nWe will pursue a lean and efficient production strategy across our business, focusing on rapid prototyping, supply chain management, integration, quality and final acceptance testing. We will work to optimize our own proprietary and customers\u2019 designs to meet scalable manufacturing requirements, mission capabilities and equipment specifications. Within this framework, we expect to develop products with feedback and input from manufacturing, quality, supply chain managers, key suppliers, logistics personnel and our customers. We will incorporate this input into product designs in an effort to maximize efficiencies and quality of our products, while minimizing time to market. As a result, we believe that we will achieve a reduction in time required to move a product from its design phase to full scale production deliveries while achieving high reliability, quality, and safety yields.\nIt is noteworthy to add that we have forged strong relationships with key suppliers in the U.S. and in U.S.-allied countries based on their ability to meet our needs and delivery timelines. We will continue to expand upon our suppliers\u2019 expertise to improve our existing products and develop new solutions. In 2020, we experienced some supply chain delays due primarily to logistical issues relating to COVID-19 shutdown mandates. Unfortunately, we do anticipate encountering potential delays in 2021.\nContract Manufacturing for Commercial Drone Package Delivery\nOver the past year, there has been a surge of prominent companies, including Alphabet (Google), FedEx, Intel, Qualcomm, Amazon, Target, Walmart, Alibaba, UPS, 7-Eleven, Uber and many others, actively developing commercial drone delivery service initiatives as part of their long-term strategic plans. These companies intend to leverage the latest in UAV technologies to deliver food, consumer products, medicines, and other types of lightweight freight direct to consumers and businesses in the fastest, most cost efficient and environmentally responsible manner possible - a practical alternative to costly auto transport. It is believed that AgEagle\u2019s proven expertise in manufacturing rugged, reliable and professional grade UAVs makes the Company a logical partner for designing, manufacturing and testing drone platforms in this fast growing package delivery market.\nIn 2020, AgEagle\u2019s annual revenue was mostly derived from contracted manufacturing work completed for a major ecommerce company, which engaged the Company to manufacture and assemble UAVs designed to meet the critical specifications for drones that are meant to carry goods in urban and suburban areas along with ground support equipment used for the testing and refining of client\u2019s commercial drone small delivery vehicles, systems and operations currently in development. This customer chose to team with AgEagle due in large measure to our proven expertise in drone design and innovation.\nIn October 2020, we expanded our contract manufacturing customer base to include Valqari, with which we entered into a two-year agreement, exclusive in North America, to produce Valqari\u2019s patented Drone Delivery Station. This station is the only solution that has solved the \u201clast inch\u201d logistic problems associated with drone deliveries and allows for an entirely automated and safe drone package delivery. We believe that effective solutions for ground support, like Valqari\u2019s Drone Delivery Station, will prove to be a vital, fundamental component of the new drone delivery ecosystem, helping to ensure the promising potential of mainstream drone package delivery is fully realized.\nWith plans to expand our in-house business development team in 2021, we are actively engaged in identifying and pursuing additional opportunities for AgEagle to develop and strengthen our customer base and/or strategic business partnerships and materially ramp annual revenue generation from our design and engineering, contract manufacturing, assembly and testing services.\nDrone Solutions\nMarket Opportunities\nIn October 2020, Gartner projected that worldwide shipments of enterprise drones will total 526,000 units, an increase of 50% from 2019. Moreover, the world\u2019s leading research and advisory company also forecasts that global shipments will reach 1.3 million units by 2023. The report, titled Forecast Analysis: IoT Enterprise Drone Shipments, Worldwide,\u201d states, \u201cIn the short term, most use cases will be based around surveillance and monitoring due to the technical complexity of other applications. In 2020, the second and third use cases by drone shipments will be fire services monitoring and insurance investigation.\u201d Gartner further believes that adoption of drones in the retail sector for package delivery will rise rapidly after 2023. \u201cThe regulatory restrictions and logistical challenges coordinating flight paths, managing airspace over densely populated areas and managing various payloads means that retail, overall, is a longer-term opportunity for drones.\u201d (Source: https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-12-04-gartner-forecasts-global-iot-enterprise-drone-shipmen).\nEmerging commercial drone markets covered in the Gartner report include:\n\u25cf Insurance Investigation\n\u25cf Rail Infrastructure management\n\u25cf Fire Services Monitoring\n\u25cf Gas (Smart Grid)\n\u25cf Road Toll and Traffic Management\n\u25cf Building Structure Monitoring\n\u25cf Construction Monitoring\n\u25cf Outdoor Surveillance\n\u25cf Oil and Gas Extraction\n\u25cf Smart Roads\n\u25cf Retail Fulfillment (Drone Package Delivery)\n\u25cf Livestock Management\n\u25cf Precision Crop Farming\n\u25cf Agricultural Equipment Tracking\n\u25cf Airport Drone Management\n\u25cf Mine Operation\n\u25cf Pipeline Monitoring\n\u25cf Security Guard Equipment\n\u25cf Electricity (Smart Grid)\n\u25cf Connected Ship Management\n\u25cf Water (Smart Grid)\n\u25cf Port Management\n\u25cf Film, TV and Journalism Drone Filming\n\u25cf Electricity Grid-Scale Generation\n\u25cf Police Evidence Gathering\nDrone Industry Insights noted in its June 2020 report, \u201cThe Drone Market Size 2020-2025: 5 Key Takeaways,\u201d that the energy sector is the largest industry on the commercial drone market in 2020 and will continue to be so in 2025. However, the transportation and warehousing industry (transportation of packages and passengers, warehousing and storage of goods and support activities related to modes of transportation for inspection and maintenance of infrastructure) will continue to be the fastest growing. While agriculture and construction currently follow energy as the top industries in the drone market, the growth of the transport sector will mean that by 2025, it will be the second largest industry in the market. Looking at the dollars, Drone Industry Insights predicts that the commercial drone solutions market will grow from $22.5 billion in 2020 to $42.8 billion by 2025.\nProprietary, Turnkey, End-to-End Drone Solutions\nThe use of commercial drones has seen its utility amplified worldwide with the spread of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging applications in drone package delivery, decontamination, infrastructure inspection, security and public safety, insurance and telecommunications have given rise to demand from commercial and industrial enterprises and government agencies for quality, turnkey solutions that tackle and solve specific mission critical challenges. AgEagle believes that we have the necessary industry experience, engineering and manufacturing resources, expertise and skilled workforce to deliver these solutions in a cost-efficient, highly scalable manner. Through purpose-built pilot projects that we are currently leading or may elect to lead or partner on in the near future, we intend to perpetuate our legacy as an industry pioneer; inventing, producing, supporting and commercializing turnkey drone solutions platforms.\nBEYOND Program- Integrating UAVs into National Airspace\nIn November 2020, AgEagle was selected as an industry partner in the next phase of the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s (US DOT) Unmanned Aircraft System Integration Pilot Program (IPP), known as the BEYOND program. The original IPP was launched through a Presidential Memorandum in October 2017 with nine regional participants. The IPP participants and their industry partners used innovative strategies to craft successful safety cases to operate drones under the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) existing regulations. On October 30, 2020, the US DOT announced that the three-year IPP successfully concluded on October 25, 2020. In the release, U.S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios noted, \u201cThe IPP propelled the American drone industry forward, allowing for unprecedented expansions in testing and operations through innovative private-public partnerships across the country. Now, the BEYOND program will build upon this success, tackling the next big challenges facing drone integration.\u201d\nEight of the nine state, local and tribal governments that participated in the original program signed new agreements with the FAA to participate in the BEYOND program, including the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT). AgEagle was selected by KDOT to serve as an industry partner in the BEYOND program to help solve key challenges including:\n\u25cf Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations that are repeatable, scalable and economically viable with specific emphasis on infrastructure inspection, public operations and small package delivery;\n\u25cf Leveraging industry operations to better analyze and quantify the societal and economic benefits of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) operations; and\n\u25cf Focusing on community engagement efforts to collect, analyze and address community concerns.\nWe believe that once the FAA ultimately determines and approves final regulations allowing for integration of commercial UAVs flown beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) into the U.S. airspace, the promising growth of drone delivery solutions is sure to take flight; and there has been positive developments in this regard.\nWhile it is our intention to continue identifying, pursuing and winning contract design, manufacturing, assembly and testing of drone delivery platforms with key industry partners, it is also our intention to design, develop and bring to market our own proprietary, end-to-end drone solutions. Participating in the BEYOND program will empower AgEagle to lead select pilot projects in key areas of interest to us - particularly in drone delivery.\nKey Growth Strategies\nWe intend to grow our business by achieving greater market penetration of the growing precision agriculture marketplace; by promoting our new service targeting the sustainable agriculture marketplace for the 2021 growing season; and by creating new, easier to use and higher value products that position AgEagle as a leading innovator and trusted solutions provider in high growth markets where advanced aerial imaging and data capture and analytics technologies can be used to achieve specific business and sustainability objectives. Currently, our management is actively exploring new vertical expansion opportunities in other industries outside of agriculture and its related areas, including drone-enabled package delivery. In addition to drone package deliveries, we believe that our solutions and services may also be well suited for use in decontamination, mapping and surveying, mining/resource exploration, insurance, inspection and infrastructure/asset inspection, among other industrial applications.\nKey components of our growth strategy include the following:\n\u25cf Achieving greater market penetration of the U.S. industrial hemp industry by working to establish HempOverview and other related products and services as the gold industry standard for hemp cultivation oversight, compliance, enforcement and commerce. AgEagle is - and intends to remain - at the leading edge of leveraging best-in-class technology to provide turnkey solutions for state and tribal regulatory departments of agriculture, industrial hemp and hemp-derived CBD growers and processors. Currently, AgEagle believes that it is the only company in the nation with extensive experience in agriculture that is effectively addressing the emerging needs and challenges of the domestic hemp cultivation industry through the application of advanced technology - a key competitive differential that the Company hopes to continue capitalizing on in the coming year.\n\u25cf Deliver new and innovative solutions. AgEagle\u2019s research and development efforts are the foundation of the Company, and we intend to continue investing in our own innovations, pioneering new and enhanced products and solutions that enable us to satisfy the Company\u2019s customers - both in response to and in anticipation of their needs. AgEagle believes that by investing in research and development, the Company can be a leader in delivering innovative drone systems and solutions that address market needs within our current target markets, enabling us to create new opportunities for growth.\n\u25cf Continue to expand the AgEagle platform of drone systems and solutions into other industries beyond agriculture and commercial package delivery. The Company is actively pursuing opportunities outside of agriculture as we continue to expand and grow the AgEagle platform. We are confident in the UAV systems, services and solutions we offer today and believe that these systems, services and solutions could provide other drone industry sectors the same kind of optimization we are currently providing the agriculture industry. Expansion initiatives include the provision of quality contract manufacturing, design and engineering, assembly and testing of advanced drones and drone-related equipment, as well as turnkey drone solutions for the broader drone market.\n\u25cf Growth through acquisition. Through successful execution of our growth-through-acquisition strategies, we intend to acquire technologically advanced drone-related companies and intellectual property that complement and strengthen our value proposition to the market. We believe that by investing in complementary acquisitions, we can accelerate our revenue growth and deliver a broader array of innovative drone systems and solutions that address specialized market needs within our current target markets and in emerging drone industry sectors.\nCompetitive Strengths\nAgEagle believes the following attributes and capabilities provide us with long-term competitive advantages:\n\u25cf Proprietary technologies, in-house capabilities and industry experience - We believe our decade of experience in commercial drone design and engineering; in-house manufacturing, assembly and testing capabilities; and advanced technology development skillset serve to differentiate AgEagle in the marketplace. As of today, we develop and manufacture all the drone systems and solutions we produce in the United States, which allows us to avoid many of the potential difficulties that could arise if our engineering and manufacturing operations were otherwise located outside of the country. In addition, AgEagle is committed to meeting and exceeding quality and safety standards for manufacturing, assembly, design and engineering and testing of drones, drone subcomponents and related drone equipment in our Wichita-based manufacturing operations.\n\u25cf Advanced technology solutions allow users to remove the guesswork in effectively managing hemp cultivation oversight, compliance, enforcement, reporting and commerce - To our knowledge, there is no other SaaS solution available on the market today - particularly one that has been developed by a proven Agtech company with the level of experience and expertise of AgEagle - that provides the multi-faceted level of support and services that HempOverview offers to all stakeholders in the industry.\n\u25cf Increased margins for farmers - We believe our drones and drone solutions directly enhance margins for commercial farmers by reducing the amount of nutrients and chemicals needed to manage their farms. The software equipped on our UAVs deliver a high-quality aerial map upon completion of the flight, allowing the user to accurately identify the specific areas that are malnourished. This software is compatible with precision applicator tractors, which assist users in applying a precise amount of nutrients in only the areas it is needed. In addition, Our UAVs are specially designed to provide users with a portable and easy to operate device, which can be controlled with a hand-held unit or tablet. Through our FarmLens platform, users are able to plan and track an efficient flight path for their UAV. The UAVs are equipped with a camera and NIR filter whose images provide a holistic aerial view of the fields, along with meaningful data that is uploaded and delivered to the user within a very short time frame. As a result, this platform allows users to quickly detect any issues in their crops, which enables them to address such issues in a timely manner before any damage, or further damage, may affect their crops.\n\u25cf Expertise in drone delivery - Since 2019, AgEagle has been actively engaged in the custom manufacturing and assembly of drones and drone equipment used for the testing and refining of a world leading ecommerce company\u2019s commercial drone small package delivery vehicles, systems and operations. As a result, we are uniquely positioned to collaborate with other organizations seeking to activate and accelerate adoption of end-to-end drone delivery solutions to drive new and differentiated value creation in their business-to-business or business-to-consumer operations.\n\u25cf Leading-edge research and delivery - In order to propel functional commercial applications of drone solutions in real world, real-time environments, and to best aid in the determination and ultimate adoption of a regulatory framework to guide and direct mainstream commercial use of drones beyond visual line of sight, AgEagle is a lead participant in the FAA\u2019s BEYOND program in Kansas and is actively engaged in partnering with other leading drone solutions companies on pilot projects with long-term commercial potential.\nGovernment Regulation\nUAV Regulation\nAgEagle\u2019s proprietary drones are subject to regulations of the FAA. On June 21, 2016, the FAA announced it had finalized the first operational rules for routine commercial use of small UAS, which for purposes of the regulations are unmanned aircraft weighing less than 55 pounds that are conducting non-hobbyist operations. UAS operators-for-hire will have to pass a written test and be vetted by the TSA, but no longer need to be airplane pilots as current law requires. The rules went into effect on August 20, 2016. For additional insight into these initial regulations created for commercial UAS operations, please see https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=20515.\nRecent Regulatory Updates\nIn September 2020, the FAA announced its policy for the type certification of certain UAS as a special class of aircraft. The 14 CFR part 21 rule contains the FAA\u2019s procedural requirements for airworthiness and type certification for small drones. The new policy is directed towards UAS operations currently not covered by the existing Part 107 rule, for example beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) and flights over people. For details regarding the new policy, please go to https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/09/18/2020-17882/type-certification-of-certain-unmanned-aircraft-systems.\nOn December 28, 2020, the FAA announced final rules for drones that will require Remote Identification (Remote ID) of drones and allow operators of small drones to fly over people and at night under certain conditions. In the related press release (https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=25541), U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao stated, \u201cThese final rules carefully address safety, security and privacy concerns while advancing opportunities for innovation and utilization of drone technology.\u201d\nThe Remote ID rule applies to all operators of drones that require FAA registration. There are three ways to comply with the operational requirements:\n1. Operate a standard Remote ID drone that broadcasts identification and location information of the drone and control station;\n2. Operate a drone with a Remote ID broadcast module (may be a separate device attached to the drone), which broadcasts identification, location, and take-off information; or\n3. Operate a drone without Remote ID but at specific FAA-recognized identification areas.\nThe Operations Over People and at Night rule applies to Part 107 operators. The ability to fly over people and moving vehicles varies depending on the level of risk a small drone operation presents to people on the ground. Operations are permitted based on four categories, which can be found in the executive summary accompanying the rule. Additionally, this rule allows for operations at night under certain conditions. For additional information regarding these and other FAA rules relating to UAS operations, please visit www.faa.gov.\nDomestic Hemp Cultivation Regulation\nThe 2018 Farm Bill directed the United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d) to establish a national regulatory framework for hemp production in the United States. The USDA established the U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program through an interim final rule outlining provisions for the USDA to approve plans submitted by States and Indian Tribes for the domestic production of hemp. It also established a Federal plan for producers in States or territories of Indian tribes that do not have their own USDA-approved plan. The program includes provisions for maintaining information on the land where hemp is produced, testing the levels of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, disposing of plants not meeting necessary requirements, licensing requirements and ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Rule. For more information on state and tribal nation plan submission, please visit https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/hemp/state-and-tribal-plan-review.\nAs of February 12, 2021, 23 states and 40 tribal nations have had their hemp production plans approved by the USDA, and 20 states will continue to operate their hemp production plans in accordance with the 2014 pilot guidelines issued by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which handles the extramural research aspects of industrial hemp cultivation.\nAgEagle has developed HempOverview to provide users with a gold industry standard for fully complying with federal, state and tribal regulations associated with hemp cultivation.\nManufacturing\nAs of today, we manufacture and assemble all our proprietary and customers\u2019 drone systems and solutions at our manufacturing facility in Wichita, Kansas.\nSuppliers\nIn 2020, we maintained strong relationships established with companies that provide many of the parts and services necessary to construct our advanced fixed wing drones, such as Botlink and MicaSense. On January 26, 2021, , the Company and AgEagle Sensor Systems, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the \u201cBuyer\u201d), entered into a stock purchase agreement (the \u201cMicaSense Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Parrot Drones S.A.S. and Justin B. McAllister (the \u201cSellers\u201d) pursuant to which the Buyer agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of MicaSense, Inc. (\u201cMicaSense\u201d) from the Sellers. The transaction closed on January 27, 2021. MicaSense manufactures and sells drone sensors for vegetation mapping and other drone applications. As our Company grows, we expect to pursue additional supplier relationships from which we can source less costly and better supplies to stay ahead of the needs of the market.\nOur flight planning and photo stitching software is provided by Pix4D and flight planning is QGroundControl, an open-source application. We have worked closely with software partners to optimize their software to work with our platform. We consider our relationships with Pix4D to be good; however, a loss of this relationship would have a short-term adverse effect on our product offerings and results of operations, as we look to an alternative provider for our photo stitching software.\nRevenue Mix\nThe table below reflects our revenue for the years indicated by product mix:\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development activities are part of our business and we follow a disciplined approach to investing our resources to create new drone technologies and solutions. A fundamental part of this approach is a well-defined screening process that helps us identify commercial opportunities that support current desired technological capabilities in the markets we serve. Our research includes the expansion of our wing products, providing for developing a portfolio of UAVs, ongoing software development, as well as other technological solutions to problems to which our existing and prospective customers must confront.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d found in",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risk factors discussed below could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Although we have attempted to list comprehensively these important factors, we caution you that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting our results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all of these factors, nor can we assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\nThe risks described below set forth what we believe to be the most material risks associated with the purchase of our Common Stock. Before you invest in our Common Stock, you should carefully consider these risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this prospectus.\nRisks Related to Our Business and the Industries We Serve\nWe operate in evolving markets, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects.\nAgEagle\u2019s drone systems and solutions are and will be sold in new and rapidly evolving markets. The commercial UAV industry is in the early stages of customer adoption and the FAA\u2019s definition of regulations relating to the integration of commercial drones into the U.S. airspace is still ill-defined but advancing. Accordingly, our business and future prospects may be difficult to evaluate. We cannot accurately predict the extent to which demand for our drone systems and solutions will increase, if at all. The challenges, risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets could impact our ability to do the following:\n\u25cf Generate sufficient revenue to achieve sustainable profitability;\n\u25cf Acquire and maintain market share;\n\u25cf Achieve or manage growth in our business operations;\n\u25cf Renew contracts;\n\u25cf Attract and retain software and system engineers and other highly qualified personnel;\n\u25cf Successfully develop and commercial market new products and end-to-end solutions;\n\u25cf Adapt to new or changing polices and spending priorities of prospective clients; and\n\u25cf Access additional capital when required and on reasonable terms.\nIf we fail to address these and other challenges, risks and uncertainties successfully, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed.\nWe have a history of operating losses and expect to incur significant additional operating expenses.\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary, AgEagle Aerial, Inc., we have been operating for approximately ten years. However, AgEagle Aerial, Inc. has only been in the UAV business for half of that time and just begun to operate in the hemp industry. We are currently in the business development stage and have limited commercial sales of our products and, accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will become profitable. Moreover, even if we achieve profitability, given the competitive and evolving nature of the industries in which we operate, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability and failure to do so would adversely affect its business, including our ability to raise additional funds.\nWe will need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs or commercialization efforts.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on product and software development. We will require additional funds to support our continued research and development activities, as well as the costs of commercializing, marketing and selling any new products and/or services resulting from those activities.\nUntil such time, if ever, that we can generate sufficient revenue and achieve profitability, we expect to seek to finance future cash needs through equity or debt financings or corporate collaborations and/or strategic arrangements. We currently have no other commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions and cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may have to delay, curtail or eliminate commercializing, marketing and selling one or more of our solutions.\nProduct development is a long, expensive and uncertain process.\nThe development of both UAV software and hardware is a costly, complex and time-consuming process, and investments in product development often involve a long wait until a return, if any, can be achieved on such investment. We might face difficulties or delays in the development process that will result in our inability to timely offer products that satisfy the market, which might allow competing products to emerge during the development and certification process. We anticipate making significant investments in research and development relating to our products and services, but such investments are inherently speculative and require substantial capital expenditures. Any unforeseen technical obstacles and challenges that we encounter in the research and development process could result in delays in or the abandonment of product commercialization, may substantially increase development costs, and may negatively affect our results of operations.\nSuccessful technical development of our products does not guarantee successful commercialization.\nAlthough we have successfully completed the technical development of our two original UAV systems, as well as the RX-60 and RX-48 systems, and have developed or acquired several software platforms which we offer for sale or subscription, we may still fail to achieve commercial success for several reasons, including, among others, the following:\n\u25cf failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals for their use;\n\u25cf rapid obsolescence of a product due to new, more advanced technologies;\n\u25cf prohibitive production costs;\n\u25cf competing products;\n\u25cf lack of product innovation;\n\u25cf unsuccessful distribution and marketing through our sales channels;\n\u25cf insufficient cooperation from our supply and distribution partners; and\n\u25cf product development that does not align with or meet customer needs.\nOur success in the market for the products and services we develop will depend largely on our ability to properly demonstrate their capabilities. Upon demonstration, our solutions may not have the capabilities they were designed to have or that we believed they would have. Furthermore, even if we do successfully demonstrate our products\u2019 capabilities, potential customers may be more comfortable doing business with a competitor; or may not feel there is a significant need for the products we develop. As a result, significant revenue from our current and new product investments may not be achieved for several years, if at all.\nWe face competition from other companies, many of which have substantially greater resources.\nOur competitors may be able to provide customers with different or greater capabilities or benefits than we can provide in areas such as technical qualifications, past contract performance, geographic presence, price and the availability of key professional personnel. Furthermore, many of our competitors may be able to utilize their substantially greater resources and economies of scale to develop competing products and technologies, manufacture in high volumes more efficiently, divert sales away from us by winning broader contracts or hire away our employees by offering more lucrative compensation packages. Small business competitors may be able to offer more cost competitive solutions, due to their lower overhead costs. The markets for commercial drones and services are quickly expanding, and competition is intensifying as additional competitors enter the market and current competitors expand their product offerings. In order to secure contracts successfully when competing with larger, better financed companies, we may be forced to agree to contractual terms that provide for lower aggregate payments to us over the life of the contract, which could adversely affect our margins. Our failure to compete effectively with respect to any of these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or future operating results.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, we could lose our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nOur intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our ability to remain competitive and successful in the development of our products and to our future growth potential. Patent protection can be limited and not all intellectual property can be patented. We expect to rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and procedures, non-competition agreements and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property, other proprietary rights and our brand. As we currently do not have any granted patent or copyright protections, we must rely on trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, which provide limited protections. Our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by employees or competitors.\nFurthermore, our competitors may independently develop technologies and products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies and products, which could result in decreased revenues. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs to us and substantial diversion of management\u2019s attention. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitors could use it to enhance their products. Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business and financial condition, and the value of our brand and other intangible assets.\nOther companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, which could materially increase our costs and harm our ability to generate future revenue and profit.\nWe do not believe that our technologies infringe on the proprietary rights of any third party; however claims of infringement are becoming increasingly common and third parties may assert infringement claims against us. It may be difficult or impossible to identify, prior to receipt of notice from a third party, the trade secrets, patent position or other intellectual property rights of a third party, either in the United States or in foreign jurisdictions. Any such assertion may result in litigation or may require us to obtain a license for the intellectual property rights of third parties. If we are required to obtain licenses to use any third-party technology, we would have to pay royalties, which may significantly reduce any profit on our products. In addition, any such litigation could be expensive and disruptive to its ability to generate revenue or enter into new market opportunities. If any of our products were found to infringe other parties\u2019 proprietary rights and we are unable to come to terms regarding a license with such parties, we may be forced to modify our products to make them non-infringing or to cease production of such products altogether.\nThe nature of our business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by insurance or indemnification.\nWe have developed and sold products and services in circumstances where insurance or indemnification may not be available, for example, in connection with the collection and analysis of various types of information. In addition, our products and services raise questions with respect to issues of civil liberties, intellectual property, trespass, conversion and similar concepts, which may create legal issues. Indemnification to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from the failure of any technologies that we develop or deploy may be available in certain circumstances but not in others. Currently, the unmanned aerial systems industry lacks a formative insurance market. We may not be able to maintain insurance to protect against all operational risks and uncertainties that our customers confront. Substantial claims resulting from an accident, product failure, or personal injury or property liability arising from our products and services in excess of any indemnity or insurance coverage (or for which indemnity or insurance coverage is not available or is not obtained) could harm our financial condition, cash flows and operating results. Any accident, even if fully covered or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively.\nWe may incur substantial product liability claims relating to our products.\nAs a manufacturer of UAV products, and with aircraft and aviation sector companies under increased scrutiny, claims could be brought against us if use or misuse of one of our UAV products causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. In addition, defects in our products may lead to other potential life, health and property risks. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources. We are unable to predict if we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance for any products that may be approved for marketing.\nOne of our contracts related to manufacturing and assembly of drones for the purpose of package delivery contains performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, require state-of-the-art manufacturing and assembly expertise, or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our growth and future prospects. Early termination of client contracts or contract penalties could adversely affect our revenues.\nWe design, develop, manufacture and assemble technologically advanced and innovative UAVs, which are expected to be applied by our first customer for drone-enabled package delivery in a variety of environments. Problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and intellectual property rights, labor, inability to achieve learning curve assumptions, manufacturing materials or components could prevent us from meeting contract requirements. Either we or the customer may generally terminate a contract as a result of a material uncured breach by the other. If we breach a contract or fail to perform in accordance with contractual service levels, delivery schedules, performance specifications, or other contractual requirements set forth in our contracted scope of services, the other party thereto may terminate such contract for default, and we may be required to refund money previously paid to us by the customer or to pay penalties or other damages. Even if we have not breached, we may deal with various situations from time to time that may result in the amendment or termination of a contract. These steps can result in significant current period charges and/or reductions in current or future revenue. Other factors that may affect revenue and future profitability include inaccurate cost estimates, design issues, unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer, diversion of management\u2019s focus in responding to unforeseen problems, and loss of follow-on work.\nIf our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance and reputation as a contractor and our ability to obtain future business could suffer.\nAs a prime contractor, we often rely upon other companies to perform work we are obligated to perform for our customers. As we secure more work under certain of our contracts, we expect to require an increasing level of support from subcontractors that provide complementary or supplementary services to our offers. We are responsible for the work performed by our subcontractors, even though in some cases we have limited involvement in that work. If one or more of our subcontractors fails to satisfactorily perform the agreed-upon services on a timely basis or violates contracting policies, laws or regulations, our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor or meet our customers\u2019 requirements may be compromised. In extreme cases, performance or other deficiencies on the part of our subcontractors could result in a customer terminating our contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability, including liability for the costs of re-procurement, could damage our reputation and could hurt our ability to compete for future contracts.\nFor certain of the components included in our products, there are a limited number of suppliers we can rely upon. If we are unable to obtain these components when needed, we could experience delays in the manufacturing of our products and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe acquire most of the components for the manufacture of our products from suppliers and subcontractors. We have not entered into any agreements or arrangements with any potential suppliers or subcontractors. Suppliers of some of the components may require us to place orders with significant lead-times to assure supply in accordance with its manufacturing requirements. Our present lack of working capital may cause us to delay the placement of such orders and may result in delays in supply. Delays in supply may significantly hurt our ability to fulfill our contractual obligations and may significantly hurt our business and result of operations. In addition, we may not be able to continue to obtain such components from these suppliers on satisfactory commercial terms. Disruptions of its manufacturing operations would ensue if we were required to obtain components from alternative sources, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain key management, technical and sales personnel, our business would be negatively affected.\nFor our business to be successful, we need to attract and retain highly qualified executive, technical and sales personnel. The failure to recruit additional key personnel when needed, with specific qualifications, on acceptable terms and with an ability to maintain positive relationships with our partners, might impede our ability to continue to develop, commercialize and sell our products and services. To the extent the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply, we could experience higher labor, recruiting and training costs in order to attract and retain such employees. The loss of any members of our management team may also delay or impair achievement of our business objectives and result in business disruptions due to the time needed for their replacements to be recruited and become familiar with our business. We face competition for qualified personnel from other companies with significantly more resources available to them and thus may not be able to attract the level of personnel needed for our business to succeed.\nIf our proposed marketing efforts are unsuccessful, we may not earn enough revenue to become profitable.\nOur future growth depends on our gaining market acceptance and regular production orders for our products and services. Our marketing plan includes attendance at trade shows, making private demonstrations, advertising, public relations, promotional materials and advertising campaigns in print and/or broadcast media. In the event we are not successful in obtaining a significant volume of orders for our products and services, we will face significant obstacles in expanding our business. We cannot give any assurance that our marketing efforts will be successful. If they are not, revenue may not be sufficient to cover our fixed costs and we may not become profitable.\nOur operating margins may be negatively impacted by reduction in sales or products sold.\nExpectations regarding future sales and expenses are largely fixed in the short term. We maintain raw materials and finished goods at a volume we feel is necessary for anticipated distribution and sales. Therefore, we may not be able to reduce costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfalls between forecasted and actual sales.\nWe face a significant risk of failure because we cannot accurately forecast our future revenues and operating results.\nThe rapidly changing nature of the markets in which we compete makes it difficult to accurately forecast our revenues and operating results. Furthermore, we expect our revenues and operating results to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf the timing of sales or subscription of our products;\n\u25cf unexpected delays in introducing new products and services;\n\u25cf increased expenses, whether related to sales and marketing or administration; and\n\u25cf costs related to possible acquisitions of businesses.\nRapid technological changes may adversely affect the market acceptance of our products and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe markets in which we compete are subject to technological changes, introduction of new products, change in customer demands and evolving industry standards. Our future success will depend upon our ability to keep pace with technological developments and to timely address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supporting existing and new technologies and by developing and introducing enhancements to our current products and services and new products and services. We may not be successful in developing and marketing enhancements to our products that will respond to technological change, evolving industry standards or customer requirements. In addition, we may experience difficulties internally or in conjunction with key vendors and partners that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and sale of such enhancements and such enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the market and may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance. If release dates of our new products or enhancements are delayed or, if when released, they fail to achieve market acceptance, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals from the FAA or other governmental agencies, or limitations put on the use of small UAS in response to public privacy concerns, may prevent us from expanding the sales of our drone solutions to commercial and industrial customers in the United States.\n\tThe regulation of small UAS for commercial use in the United States is undergoing substantial change and the ultimate treatment is uncertain. In 2006, the FAA issued a clarification of its existing policies stating that in order to engage in commercial use of small UAS in the U.S. National Airspace System, a public operator must obtain a COA from the FAA or fly in restricted airspace. The FAA\u2019s COA approval process requires that the public operator certify the airworthiness of the aircraft for its intended purpose, that a collision with another aircraft or other airspace user is extremely improbable, that the small unmanned aircraft system complies with appropriate cloud and terrain clearances and that the operator or spotter of the small unmanned aircraft system is generally within one half-mile laterally and 400 feet vertically of the small unmanned aircraft system while in operation. Furthermore, the FAA\u2019s clarification of existing policy stated that the rules for radio-controlled hobby aircraft do not apply to public or commercial use of small UAS.\nOn February 14, 2012, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 was enacted, establishing various deadlines for the FAA to allow expanded use of small UAS for both public and commercial applications. On June 21, 2016, the FAA released its final rules regarding the routine use of certain small UAS (under 55 pounds) in the U.S. National Airspace System pursuant to the act (the \u201cPart 107 Rules\u201d). The Part 107 Rules, which became effective in August 2016, provided safety regulations for small UAS conducting non-recreational operations and contain various limitations and restrictions for such operations, including a requirement that operators keep UAS within visual-line-of-sight and prohibiting flights over unprotected people on the ground who are not directly participating in the operation of the UAS. On December 28, 2020, the FAA announced final rules requiring remote identification of drones and allowing operators of small drones to fly over people and at night under certain conditions. We cannot assure you that any final rules enacted in furtherance of the FAA\u2019s announced proposals will result in the expanded use of our drones and drone solutions by commercial and industrial entities. In addition, there exists public concern regarding the privacy implications of U.S. commercial use of small UAS. This concern has included calls to develop explicit written policies and procedures establishing usage limitations. We cannot assure you that the response from regulatory agencies, customers and privacy advocates to these concerns will not delay or restrict the adoption of small UAS by the commercial use markets.\nFederal, state and tribal government regulation of domestic hemp cultivation is new and subject to constant change and evolution, and unfavorable developments could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nAny changes in laws or regulations relating to domestic hemp cultivation could adversely affect our business, results of operations and our business prospects for our HempOverview SaaS platform.\nOur future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those involving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, regulations of the FAA, regulations of the USDA and state or tribal departments of agriculture, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery, anti-corruption or other matters.\nThe outcome of any future legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. Various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable; or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. We are not currently involved in or subject to any such legal or regulatory proceedings, but we cannot guarantee that such proceedings may not occur in the future.\nWe may pursue additional strategic transactions in the future, which could be difficult to implement, disrupt our business or change our business profile significantly.\nWe intend to consider additional potential strategic transactions, which could involve acquisitions of businesses or assets, joint ventures or investments in businesses, products or technologies that expand, complement or otherwise relate to our current or future business. We may also consider, from time to time, opportunities to engage in joint ventures or other business collaborations with third parties to address particular market segments. Should our relationships fail to materialize into significant agreements, or should we fail to work efficiently with these companies, we may lose sales and marketing opportunities and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThese activities, if successful, create risks such as, among others: (i) the need to integrate and manage the businesses and products acquired with our own business and products; (ii) additional demands on our resources, systems, procedures and controls; (iii) disruption of our ongoing business; (iv) potential unknown or unquantifiable liabilities associated with the target company; and (v) diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Moreover, these transactions could involve: (a) substantial investment of funds or financings by issuance of debt or equity securities; (b) substantial investment with respect to technology transfers and operational integration; and (c) the acquisition or disposition of product lines or businesses. Also, such activities could result in one-time charges and expenses and have the potential to either dilute the interests of our existing shareholders or result in the issuance of, or assumption of debt. Such acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or other business collaborations may involve significant commitments of financial and other resources. Any such activities may not be successful in generating revenue, income or other returns, and any resources we committed to such activities will not be available to us for other purposes. Moreover, if we are unable to access the capital markets on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to consummate acquisitions, or may have to do so on the basis of a less than optimal capital structure. Our inability to take advantage of growth opportunities or address risks associated with acquisitions or investments in businesses may negatively affect our operating results.\nAdditionally, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in an acquisition or in an investment, or charges to earnings associated with any acquisition or investment activity, may materially reduce our earnings. Future acquisitions or joint ventures may not result in their anticipated benefits and we may not be able to properly integrate acquired products, technologies or businesses with our existing products and operations or successfully combine personnel and cultures. Failure to do so could deprive us of the intended benefits of those acquisitions.\nBreaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business.\nCyber-attacks or other breaches of network or IT security may cause equipment failures or disrupt our systems and operations. We may be subject to attempts to breach the security of our networks and IT infrastructure through cyber-attack, malware, computer viruses and other means of unauthorized access. The potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Our inability to operate our facilities as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses or loss of market share to other competitors in the defense electronics market. In addition, a failure to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against breaches of network or IT security could result in damage to our reputation. To date, we have not been subject to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents which, individually or in the aggregate, resulted in a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe preparation of our financial statements involves use of estimates, judgments and assumptions, and our financial statements may be materially affected if our estimates prove to be inaccurate.\nFinancial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States require the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Different estimates, judgments, and assumptions reasonably could be used that would have a material effect on the financial statements, and changes in these estimates, judgments and assumptions are likely to occur from period to period in the future. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions are inherently uncertain, and, if they prove to be wrong, then we face the risk that charges to income will be required.\nOur results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises or other catastrophic events.\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and other adverse weather and climate conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; or other catastrophic events, such as disasters occurring at our manufacturing facilities, could disrupt our operations or the operations of one or more of our vendors. In particular, these types of events could impact our product supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability to operate. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions. Disasters occurring at our manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers\u2019 perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has evolved into a global pandemic. The coronavirus has spread to many regions of the world, including the United States. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.\nShould the coronavirus continue to spread, our business operations could be delayed or interrupted. For instance, we currently utilize third parties to, among other things, manufacture components and parts for the proprietary and contracted drones we produce, and to perform quality testing. We also manufacture and assemble products and perform various services at our manufacturing facility. If either we or any third-parties in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes are adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, our supply chain may be disrupted, limiting our ability to manufacture and assemble products.\nThe spread of the coronavirus, which has caused a broad impact globally, including restrictions on travel and quarantine policies put into place by businesses and governments, may have a material economic effect on our business. While the potential economic impact brought on by and the duration of the pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruptions of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital either at all or on favorable terms. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of the coronavirus could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our Common Stock.\nThe ultimate impact of the current pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.\nWorldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions, including an economic decline in the agricultural industry, may adversely affect our operating performance.\nWe intend to distribute our products and services in a number of countries and derive revenues from both inside and outside the United States. We expect our business will be subject to global competition and may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond our control, such as disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, in specific countries or regions, or in the agricultural industry; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; natural and other disasters affecting our operations or our customers and suppliers; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Unfavorable global or regional economic conditions, including an economic decline in the agricultural industry, could adversely impact our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur senior management and key employees are important to our customer relationships and overall business.\nWe believe that our success depends in part on the continued contributions of our senior management and key employees. We rely heavily on our executive officers, senior management and key employees to generate business and execute programs successfully. In addition, the relationships and reputation that members of our management team and key employees have established and maintain with certain key customers continue to our ability to maintain good customer relations and to identify new business opportunities. The loss of any of our executive officers, members of our senior management team or key employees could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could materially harm our business and customer relationships and impair our ability to identify and secure new contracts and otherwise manage our business.\nWe indemnify our officers and directors against liability to us and our security holders, and such indemnification could increase our operating costs.\nOur bylaws allow us to indemnify our officers and directors against claims associated with carrying out the duties of their offices. Our bylaws also allow us to reimburse them for the costs of certain legal defenses. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our officers, directors or control persons, the SEC has advised that such indemnification is against public policy and is therefore unenforceable.\nRisks Associated with Our Capital Stock\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance.\nOur securities may experience substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors, including, among others:\n\u25cf sales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock;\n\u25cf announcements about us or about our competitors or new product introductions;\n\u25cf developments concerning our product manufacturers;\n\u25cf the loss or unanticipated underperformance of our global distribution channel;\n\u25cf litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf conditions in the UAV, domestic hemp cultivation and drone-enabled package delivery industries;\n\u25cf governmental regulation and legislation;\n\u25cf variations in our anticipated or actual operating results;\n\u25cf changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u25cf foreign currency values and fluctuations; and\n\u25cf overall political and economic conditions.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets have historically experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors could reduce the market price of our securities, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of existing and future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, from the sale of our Common Stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation, our by-laws and Nevada law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Common Stock.\nProvisions of our Articles of Incorporation, our By-Laws and Nevada law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions include:\n\u25cf the inability of stockholders to call special meetings; and\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could include the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control or could be used to institute a rights plan, also known as a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors.\nThe existence of the forgoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your Common Stock in an acquisition.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public reporting company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public reporting company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance.\nWe currently have outstanding, and we may in the future issue, instruments which are convertible into shares of Common Stock, which will result in additional dilution to our shareholders.\nWe currently have an outstanding instrument which is convertible into shares of Common Stock, and we may need to issue similar instruments in the future. In the event that these convertible instruments are converted into shares of outstanding Common Stock, or that we make additional issuances of other convertible or exchangeable securities, you could experience additional dilution. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to issue shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share paid by investors or the then current market price.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our securities.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\u201cFINRA\u201d) has adopted rules that a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment recommended to a customer is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives, and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for certain customers. FINRA requirements will likely make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our Common Stock, which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the shares, resulting in fewer broker-dealers may be willing to make a market in our shares, potentially reducing a stockholder\u2019s ability to resell our securities.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our shares or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, the price of our securities and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of these analyst\u2019s cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, the price of our securities could decline.",

However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage intended to cover professional liability and certain other claims, we cannot assure that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against us in the future where the outcomes of such claims are unfavorable to us. Liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage, including coverage for professional liability and certain other claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLopez v.

Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these forward-looking statements. The operating results for the periods presented were not significantly affected by inflation.\nCompany Overview\nAgEagle\u2122 Aerial Systems Inc. (\u201cAgEagle,\u201d \u201cthe Company,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d) produces, supports and operates technologically advanced drone systems and solutions for the fast-emerging unmanned aerial vehicle (\u201cUAV\u201d) industry. We are engaged in delivering the metrics, tools and strategies necessary to invent and implement drone-enabled solutions that solve important problems for our valued customers. With our founding premise rooted in high performance, next-level thinking, and technological innovation, AgEagle is intent on ensuring that new standards for quality U.S. manufacturing and the provision of precision-crafted, purpose-built drone systems and solutions are delivered to empower our customers to thrive and prosper in The Drone Age. \u2122\nFounded in 2010, AgEagle was originally formed to pioneer proprietary, professional-grade, fixed-wing drones and aerial imagery-based data collection and analytics solutions for the agriculture industry. In addition to selling our innovative drones to the precision and sustainable farming markets, AgEagle\u2019s innovative data collection and analytics solutions have processed more than two million acres of crops, analyzing data from over 50 countries and 53 difference crop types, and creating more than 11,000 crop reports for its users. AgEagle remains intent on earning distinction as a trusted partner to clients seeking to adopt and support productive agricultural approaches to improve farming practices which currently limit the impact on our natural resources, reduce reliance on inputs and materially increase crop yields and profits.\nIn the first half of 2019, the Company introduced HempOverview, a scalable, responsive and cost-effective SaaS web- and map-based technology platform to support the operations of domestic industrial hemp programs for state and tribal nation departments of agriculture - a solution that provides users with what the Company believes is the gold standard for regulatory oversight, operational assistance and reporting capabilities for the fast emerging industrial hemp industry.\nOver the past decade, the broader drone market has continued to evolve and expand. As a result, economic and productivity benefits made possible by drones is fueling global demand for high quality, safe and reliable drone systems and solutions for commercial applications well beyond agriculture. In response, AgEagle is now leveraging our technological expertise and drone engineering and manufacturing experience to penetrate new, high growth market sectors; namely, drone package delivery, public safety/security, large venue decontamination and infrastructure/ inspection, among other high growth market opportunities.\nAgEagle\u2019s key growth objectives are centered on three primary areas of focus:\n1) Ag Solutions: Leveraging our reputation as one of the leading technology solutions providers to the agriculture industry to increase market share through delivery of best-in-class drones, sensors and data analytics for hemp and other commercial crops;\n2) Drone Manufacturing: Establishing AgEagle as the dominant commercial drone design, engineering, manufacturing, assembly and testing company in the United States; and\n3) Drone Solutions: Establishing the Company as one of the industry\u2019s leading American-made trusted source for turnkey, end-to-end, tailored drone solutions to the world.\nWe intend to grow our business by preserving a leadership position in our core Ag Solutions business; providing quality contract manufacturing, assembly and testing services; and innovating new customer-focused drone systems and solutions to capture significant share of the broader commercial drone market. In addition, we expect to accelerate our growth and expansion through strategic acquisitions of drone-related companies offering distinct technological and competitive advantages and have defensible IP protection in place, if applicable.\nKey Growth Strategies\nWe intend to grow our business by achieving greater market penetration of the growing precision agriculture marketplace; by promoting our new service targeting the sustainable agriculture marketplace for the 2021 growing season; and by creating new, easier to use and higher value products that position AgEagle as a leading innovator and trusted solutions provider in high growth markets where advanced aerial imaging and data capture and analytics technologies can be used to achieve specific business and sustainability objectives. Currently, our management is actively exploring new vertical expansion opportunities in other industries outside of agriculture and its related areas, including drone-enabled package delivery. In addition to drone package deliveries, we believe that our solutions and services may also be well suited for use in decontamination, mapping and surveying, mining/resource exploration, insurance inspection and infrastructure/asset inspection, among other industrial applications.\nKey components of our growth strategy include the following:\n\u25cf Achieving greater market penetration of the U.S. industrial hemp industry by working to establish HempOverview and other related products and services as the gold industry standard for hemp cultivation oversight, compliance, enforcement and commerce. AgEagle is - and intends to remain - at the leading edge of leveraging best-in-class technology to provide turnkey solutions for state and tribal regulatory departments of agriculture, industrial hemp and hemp-derived CBD growers and processors. At this time, AgEagle believes that it is the only company in the nation with extensive experience in agriculture that is effectively addressing the emerging needs and challenges of the domestic hemp cultivation industry through the application of advanced technology - a key competitive differential that the Company hopes to continue capitalizing on in the coming year.\n\u25cf Deliver new and innovative solutions. AgEagle\u2019s research and development efforts are the foundation of the Company, and we intend to continue investing in our own innovations, pioneering new and enhanced products and solutions that enable us to satisfy the Company\u2019s customers - both in response to and in anticipation of their needs. AgEagle believes that by investing in research and development, the Company can be a leader in delivering innovative drone systems and solutions that address market needs within our current target markets, enabling us to create new opportunities for growth.\n\u25cf Continue to expand the AgEagle platform of drone systems and solutions into other industries beyond agriculture and commercial package delivery. The Company is actively pursuing opportunities outside of agriculture as we continue to expand and grow the AgEagle platform. We are confident in the UAV systems, services and solutions we offer today and believe that these systems, services and solutions could provide other drone industry sectors the same kind of optimization we are currently providing the agriculture industry. Expansion initiatives include the provision of quality contract manufacturing, design and engineering, assembly and testing of advanced drones and drone-related equipment, as well as turnkey drone solutions for the broader drone market.\n\u25cf Growth through acquisition. Through successful execution of our growth-through-acquisition strategies, we intend to acquire technologically-advanced drone-related companies and intellectual property that complement and strengthen our value proposition to the market. We believe that by investing in complementary acquisitions, we can accelerate our revenue growth and deliver a broader array of innovative drone systems and solutions that address specialized market needs within our current target markets and in emerging drone industry sectors.\nCompetitive Strengths\nAgEagle believes the following attributes and capabilities provide us with long-term competitive advantages:\n\u25cf Proprietary technologies, in-house capabilities and industry experience - We believe our decade of experience in commercial drone design and engineering; in-house manufacturing, assembly and testing capabilities; and advanced technology development skillset serve to differentiate AgEagle in the marketplace. As of today, we develop and manufacture all the drone systems and solutions we produce in the United States, which allows us to avoid many of the potential difficulties that could arise if our engineering and manufacturing operations were otherwise located outside of the country. In addition, AgEagle is committed to meeting and exceeding quality and safety standards for manufacturing, assembly, design and engineering and testing of drones, drone subcomponents and related drone equipment in our Wichita-based manufacturing operations.\n\u25cf Advanced technology solutions allow users to remove the guesswork in effectively managing hemp cultivation oversight, compliance, enforcement, reporting and commerce - To our knowledge, there is no other SaaS solution available on the market today - particularly one that has been developed by a proven Agtech company with the level of experience and expertise of AgEagle - that provides the multi-faceted level of support and services that HempOverview offers to all stakeholders in the industry.\n\u25cf Increased margins for farmers - We believe our drones and drone solutions directly enhance margins for commercial farmers by reducing the amount of nutrients and chemicals needed to manage their farms. The software equipped on our UAVs deliver a high-quality aerial map upon completion of the flight, allowing the user to accurately identify the specific areas that are malnourished. This software is compatible with precision applicator tractors, which assist users in applying a precise amount of nutrients in only the areas it is needed. In addition, Our UAVs are specially designed to provide users with a portable and easy to operate device, which can be controlled with a hand-held unit or tablet. Through our FarmLens platform, users are able to plan and track an efficient flight path for their UAV. The UAVs are equipped with a camera and NIR filter whose images provide a holistic aerial view of the fields, along with meaningful data that is uploaded and delivered to the user within a very short time frame. As a result, this platform allows users to quickly detect any issues in their crops, which enables them to address such issues in a timely manner before any damage, or further damage, may affect their crops.\n\u25cf Expertise in drone delivery - Since 2019, AgEagle has been actively engaged in the custom manufacturing and assembly of drones and drone equipment used for the testing and refining of a world leading ecommerce company\u2019s commercial drone small package delivery vehicles, systems and operations. As a result, we are uniquely positioned to collaborate with other organizations seeking to activate and accelerate adoption of end-to-end drone delivery solutions to drive new and differentiated value creation in their business-to-business or business-to-consumer operations.\n\u25cf Leading-edge research and delivery - In order to propel functional commercial applications of drone solutions in real world, real-time environments, and to best aid in the determination and ultimate adoption of a regulatory framework to guide and direct mainstream commercial use of drones beyond visual line of sight, AgEagle is a lead participant in the FAA\u2019s BEYOND program in Kansas and is actively engaged in partnering with other leading drone solutions companies on pilot projects with long-term commercial potential.\nImpact of COVID-19 On Our Business Operations\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has evolved into a global pandemic. The coronavirus has spread to many regions of the world, including the United States. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.\nShould the coronavirus continue to spread, our business operations could be delayed or interrupted. For instance, we currently utilize third parties to, among other things, manufacture components and parts for the proprietary and contracted drones we produce, and to perform quality testing. We also manufacture and assemble products and perform various services at our manufacturing facility. If either we or any third-parties in the supply chain for materials used in our manufacturing and assembly processes are adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, our supply chain may be disrupted, limiting our ability to manufacture and assemble products.\nThe spread of the coronavirus, which has caused a broad impact globally, including restrictions on travel and quarantine policies put into place by businesses and governments, may have a material economic effect on our business. While the potential economic impact brought on by and the duration of the pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruptions of global financial markets, which may reduce our future ability to access capital either at all or on favorable terms. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of the coronavirus could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our Common Stock.\nThe ultimate impact of the current pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations in the future. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, in addition to complying with \u2019shelter at home\u2019 mandates in those states affecting our employees, most of whom worked virtually from their homes, our supply chain was adversely impacted by the pandemic, causing material delays in the delivery of critical supply orders associated with timely fulfilling our obligations to our large ecommerce client. As a consequence, revenues originally expected to be reported in the second quarter 2020 were reported in the third quarter 2020 results.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management\u2019s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our most critical estimates include those related to revenue recognition, inventories and reserves for excess and obsolescence, accounting for stock-based awards, and income taxes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting estimates affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Please see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report, for our Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. There have been no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our revenue is generated pursuant to written contractual arrangements to develop, manufacture and/or modify complex drone related products, and to provide associated engineering, technical and other services according to customer specifications. These contracts are a fixed price and we account for all revenue contracts in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d). Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. We account for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.\nTopic 606 requires revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and recognize revenue under the new standard as costs are incurred. Under previous U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), revenue was generally recognized when deliveries were made, performance milestones were attained, or as costs were incurred. The new standard accelerates the timing of when the revenue is recognized, however, it does not change the total amount of revenue recognized on our UAVS contracts. The new standard does not affect revenue recognition for purposes of our UAVS or software subscription sales as each of the Company\u2019s revenue transactions represent a single performance obligation that is satisfied at a point in time or monthly subscription fees which are recognized ratably over the subscription period, as defined in the new ASU. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for small UAS product contracts with customers at the point in time when the transfer of control passes to the customer, which is generally upon delivery.\nInventories and Reserve for Obsolescence\nOur policy for valuation of inventory, including the determination of obsolete inventory, requires us to perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date, which includes a review of, among other factors, an estimate of future demand for products within specific time horizons, valuation of existing inventory, as well as product lifecycle and product development plans. Inventory reserves are also provided to cover risks arising from slow-moving items. We write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. We may be required to record additional inventory write-downs if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure fair value, which ranges from four to five years.\nOur goodwill balance was $3.1 million at December 31, 2020 and $3.1 million at December 31, 2019. We perform an annual impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.\nWe use a quantitative approach when testing goodwill. To perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, existing firm orders, expected future orders, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance.\nFinite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the applicable useful lives, ranging from four to five years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. If events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group\u2019s carrying value. If the asset group\u2019s carrying amount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2020, and 2019, we performed our annual goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets impairment tests for our SaaS reporting unit. The results of that test indicated that for our SaaS reporting unit no impairment charges existed for the recorded goodwill of $3.1M or the related finite-intangibles assets of approximately $521K as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, the results of the impairment test indicated that for our SaaS reporting unit an impairment existed for the recorded goodwill of $3.3M but not for related finite-intangibles assets of approximately $521K, resulting in a partial impairment charge on our goodwill of approximately $163,000.\nShare-Based Compensation Awards\nThe value we assign to the options that we issue is based on the fair market value as calculated by the Black-Scholes pricing model. To perform a calculation of the value of our options, we determine an estimate of the volatility of our stock. We need to estimate volatility because there has not been enough trading of our stock to determine an appropriate measure of volatility. We believe our estimate of volatility is reasonable, and we review the assumptions used to determine this whenever we issue new equity instruments. If we have a material error in our estimate of the volatility of our stock, our expenses could be understated or overstated. All share-based awards are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the options.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are required to estimate our income taxes, which includes estimating our current income taxes as well as measuring the temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. We currently have significant deferred assets, which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments. Realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends on our achieving projected future taxable income. We may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors, which may result in recording a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded revenues of $1,285,383 compared to revenues of $296,677 for the same period in 2019, a 333% increase. The increase was mainly due to new revenues derived from purchase orders to manufacture and assemble drones and related delivery products designed to meet specific criteria for package delivery in urban and suburban area. Revenue growth was also positively impacted by the continued focus on expansion of our platform, providing aerial imaging and analytics solutions which serve new and emerging markets including registration, oversight, and compliance of hemp fields by state departments of agriculture.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, cost of sales totaled $711,650, a $509,601, or 252%, increase when compared to $202,049 in the year ended December 31, 2019. We had a gross profit of $573,733, or 45% gross profit margin, during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $94,628, or 32% gross profit margin, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary factors contributing to the increase in our cost of sales and gross profit margin was due to the continued shift in mix of products and services we now offer customers in the new markets we serve that have resulted in higher margin for our sales.\nWe recorded total operating expenses of $5,505,040 during 2020, a 110% increase as compared to operating expenses of $2,616,821 in the same period of 2019. Our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative expenses, professional fees, and selling expenses. General and administrative expenses totaled $2,732,274 in 2020 compared to $1,850,225 in 2019, an increase of 48%. The increase was primarily due to recruiting fees associated with the search for new CEO, costs for public relations services, payments to directors as compensation fees, additional payroll and bonus payments associated with new hires and existing employees, stock compensation expenses, and added annual shareholder meeting costs. Professional fees also increased 308% as we had $2,703,371 of expenses for the current period versus $662,633 in the comparable prior period. The increase was mainly due to additional consulting service fees related to additional operational and business development consultants required to expand our growth opportunities, fractional CTO services, along with incremental legal expenses mainly associated with our capital raising activities and an estimated contingent liability accrual associated with a consultant agreement. Also included in operating expenses was selling costs that decreased 38% to $40,003 versus $65,015 in the prior year\u2019s comparable period due to less travel and conference expenses for the purposes of new business development as a result of COVID-19. Lastly, we recorded $29,392 and $38,498 related to research and development expenses during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOther income (expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2020 was ($594) as we recorded a loss on disposal of fixed assets due to our moving to Wichita. There was no other income (expenses) recorded for the comparable period during 2019.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $549 related to the Paycheck Protection Plan (PPP) loan as compared to $501 in the prior year related to a promissory note that was repaid in March 2019.\nOur net loss was $4,932,450 in 2020. This represents a $2,409,756 increase over our net loss of $2,522,694 in 2019. Overall, the increase in net loss is due to greater operating costs which includes additional general and administrative costs along with added professional expenses as a result of the shift in our sales and long-term growth strategies that required increase business development resources, offset by approximately $163,000 charge of a goodwill impairment that occurred in 2019. We are in the process of continuing to address these shifts by developing new platforms, products and services that support prevailing growth opportunities in domestic industrial hemp and sustainable agriculture and growing our drone-enabled package delivery business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our net loss available to Common Stockholders was $14,043,777 and $2,684,916, respectively an increase of $11,358,861. The increase is due to non-cash charges stemming from required deemed dividend accounting for modifications to certain preferred stock, redemption of preferred stock and the trigger of Down Round provisions on certain preferred stock and warrants.\nCash Flows\nDecember 31, 2020 As Compared to December 31, 2019\nCash on hand was $23,940,333 on December 31, 2020, an increase of $23,222,336 compared to the $717,997 on hand at December 31, 2019. Cash used in operations for 2020 was $2,256,571 compared to $1,818,290 of cash used by operations for 2019. The increase in cash used in operating activities was driven largely decrease in deferred revenue offset by an increase mainly in accounts payables and accrued expenses related to purchases of inventories and payments for professional services and other costs associated the growth of the business.\nCash used by investing activities during 2020 was $779,023compared to $24,445 in 2019. The increase in cash used in our investing activities resulted from the addition of note receivable agreements executed for the purposes of a strategic partnership and a letter of intent associated with an acquisition. In addition, we made purchases of property and equipment and building improvements related to the new leased warehouse and corporate offices along with recording capitalized costs associated with the development of the HempOverview platform.\nCash provided in financing activities during the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 was $26,257,930 compared to cash used in financing activities of $40,998 as of December 31, 2019. The increase in cash provided by our financing activities was due to sales of our Preferred Stock, Common Stock, warrants, and promissory note proceeds as part of Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act\u2019s Paycheck Protection Plan (PPP).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had working capital of $22,615,624 and a loss from operations of $4,932,450 for the period then ended. While there can be no guarantees, we believe cash on hand, in connection with cash generated from revenue, will be sufficient to fund the next year of operations. In addition, we intend to pursue other opportunities of raising capital with outside investors.\nOn April 7, 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with, an existing an institutional investor and shareholder of the Company (the \u201cInvestor\u201d), pursuant to which the Board of Directors of the Company authorized 1,050 shares of a newly designated series of preferred stock, the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock was convertible at $0.25 per share into an aggregate of 4,200,000 shares of the Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share. The purchase price for the Preferred Stock was $1,050,000 of which we received net proceeds of $1,010,000.\nOn May 11, 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an Investor pursuant to which we agreed to sell to the Investor (in a registered direct offering) 2,400,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001, and pre-funded warrants (the \u201cPre-Funded Warrants\u201d) to purchase up to 3,260,377 shares of Common Stock, for gross proceeds of approximately $6 million and net proceeds of $5,950,010 after issuance costs. The purchase price for each share of Common Stock was $1.06 and the purchase price for each Pre-Funded Warrant was $1.05999. The exercise price for each Warrant was $0.001. Net proceeds from the sale were used to repurchase 262 shares of our Series E Preferred Stock, convertible into 1,048,000 shares of Common Stock currently held by the Investor at a repurchase price of $1.06 per share of Common Stock.\nOn June 24, 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an Investor pursuant to which we agreed to sell to the Investor in a registered direct offering 4,407,400 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 1,956,236 shares of Common Stock, and warrants to purchase up to 2,455,476 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $1.35 per share (the \u201cWarrants\u201d), for gross proceeds of $7 million (which included subsequent payment of the exercise price of the Pre-Funded Warrants in the amount of $1,956.24. Upon exercise of the Warrants in full by the Investor, we received additional gross proceeds of $3,314,892. The shares of Common Stock underlying the Pre-Funded Warrants and the Warrants are referred to as \u201cWarrant Shares.\u201d The purchase price for each share of Common Stock is $1.10 and the purchase price for each Pre-Funded Warrant is $1.099. The exercise price for each Pre-Funded Warrant is $0.001. As of December 31, 2020, all the Warrant Shares were fully exercised.\nOn August 4, 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an Investor, pursuant to which we agreed to sell to the Investor in a registered direct offering 3,335,705 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001, and warrants to purchase up to 2,516,778 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $3.30 per share, for gross proceeds of approximately $10 million.

The exercise price for each Pre-Funded Warrant is $0.001.\nThe Company has continued to realize losses from operations. However, as a result of our capital raise efforts, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our anticipated operating costs and capital expenditure requirements through December 2022. Our primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of our business, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service, and for general corporate purposes. Our primary source of liquidity is funds generated by financing activities and from private placements. Our ability to fund our operations, to make planned capital expenditures, to make planned acquisitions, to make scheduled debt payments, and to repay or refinance indebtedness depends on our future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nIf the Company is unable to generate significant sales growth in the near term and raise additional capital, there is a risk that the Company could default on additional obligations; and could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of its operations if no other means of financing operations are available. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities or any other adjustment that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOn December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Since our inception, except for standard operating leases, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.\nContractual Obligations\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leases office space located at 8863 E. 34th Street North, Wichita, Kansas 67226.

The aggregate estimated rent payments due over the initial three-year term is $297,000. The landlord may grant the Company the option to extend the term for an additional thirty-six months. The aggregate estimated rent payments due over the option term would be $314,640 and the right of use asset is $257,363 as of December 31, 2020.\nGreenBlock Capital LLC Consulting Agreement\nOn May 3, 2019, we entered into a consulting agreement with GreenBlock Capital LLC (\u201cConsultant\u201d) to serve as strategic advisor and consultant with respect to the development of new business opportunities and the implementation of business strategies related to expansion into the emerging domestic hemp cultivation market. The extent of the services will be set forth in separate scopes of work, from time to time, to be prepared and mutually agreed to by the parties. As compensation for the services under the terms of the agreement, the Consultant can receive (i) $25,000 per month during the term of the agreement, (ii) 500,000 shares of restricted Common Stock upon execution of the agreement and up to (iii) up to 2,500,000 shares of restricted Common Stock upon the achievement of predetermined milestones.\nOn October 31, 2019, the consulting agreement was terminated as a result of the Company no longer needing these services to be provided by an outside consultant. There are no early termination penalties incurred as a result of the termination of the consulting agreement. The Consultant may still be entitled to receive up to 2,500,000 shares of restricted Common Stock after termination of the Agreement, if the achievement of milestones that commenced during the term of the Agreement are completed after termination.\nOn November 12, 2019, we announced that the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) had chosen our HempOverview software-as-a-solution (SaaS) platform to manage the online application submission and registration process for hemp growers and their farms and hemp fields for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 planting seasons (the \u201cFlorida Contract\u201d). Prior to the termination of the Agreement with the Consultant, as part of the Consultant\u2019s services, Consultant introduced us to the FDACS, which introduction resulted in us signing the Florida Contract. Since the Consultant was instrumental in identifying and introducing us to FDACS prior to termination of the Agreement, the execution of the Florida Contract is a milestone achieved by the Consultant under the terms of the Agreement.

Except as we otherwise indicate below and under applicable community property laws, we believe that the beneficial owners of the Common Stock listed below, based on information they have furnished to us, have sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown. Except as otherwise indicated, each stockholder named in the table is assumed to have sole voting and investment power with respect to the number of shares listed opposite the stockholder\u2019s name.\n* Represents less than one percent\n(1) Unless otherwise indicated, such individual\u2019s address is c/o AgEagle Aerial Systems, Inc., 8863 E. 34th Street North, Wichita, Kansas 67226.\n(2) The persons named in this table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of Common Stock reflected as beneficially owned by them. A person is deemed to be the beneficial owner of securities that can be acquired by such person within sixty (60) days from March 15, 2021 and the total outstanding shares used to calculate each beneficial owner\u2019s percentage includes such shares, although such shares are not taken into account in the calculations of the total number of shares or percentage of outstanding shares. Beneficial ownership as reported does not include shares subject to option or conversion that are not exercisable within 60 days of March 15, 2021.\n(3) All shares reflected are those shares of Common Stock which underlie options issued and fully vested, as of March 15, 2021.\nEquity Compensation Plans\nCompany 2017 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan\nThe Amended and Restated 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan is a comprehensive incentive compensation plan under which the Company can grant equity-based and other incentive awards to officers, employees and directors of, and consultants and advisers to, the Company The purpose of the Plan is to help the Company attract, motivate and retain such persons and thereby enhance shareholder value. The Plan provides for the grant of awards which are incentive stock options (\u201cISOs\u201d), non-qualified stock options (\u201cNQSOs\u201d), unrestricted shares , restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance stock, performance units, SARs, tandem stock appreciation rights, distribution equivalent rights, or any combination of the foregoing, to key management employees, non-employee directors, and non-employee consultants of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (each a \u201cparticipant\u201d) (however, solely Company employees or employees of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are eligible for incentive stock option awards). The Company has reserved a total of 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance as or under awards to be made under the Plan.\nTypes of Stock Awards\nThe Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options. Stock options may be granted to employees, including officers, non-employee directors and consultants of the Company or its affiliates, except that incentive stock options may be granted only to employees.\nShare Reserve\nThe aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that have been reserved for issuance under the Plan is 4,000,000. As of December 31, 2020, there are 3,267,965 shares underlying options granted under the Plan and 732,035 shares of Common Stock available for future issuance under the Plan. If a stock option award expires, terminates, is canceled, or is forfeited for any reason, the number of shares subject to the stock option award will again be available for issuance. In addition, if stock awards are settled in cash, the share reserve will be reduced by the number of shares of Common Stock with a value equal to the amount of the cash distributions as of the time that such amount was determined and if stock options are exercised using net exercise, the share reserve will be reduced by the gross number of shares of Common Stock subject to the exercised portion of the option. We also had 207,055 shares underlying options that have been granted outside of the Plan which were exercised on July 20, 2020.\nAdministration\nOur Board of Directors, or a duly authorized committee thereof, has the authority to administer the Plan. Subject to the terms of the Plan, our board of directors or the authorized committee, referred to herein as the committee, determines recipients, dates of grant, the numbers and types of stock awards to be granted and the terms and conditions of the stock option awards, including the period of exercisability and vesting schedule applicable to a stock option award. Subject to the limitations set forth below, the committee will also determine the exercise price and the types of consideration to be paid for the award.

The committee has the authority to adopt, alter and repeal administrative rules, guidelines and practices governing the Plan and to perform all other acts, including delegating administrative responsibilities, as it deems advisable to construe and interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan and any stock option award granted under the Plan. Decisions and interpretations or other actions by the committee are in the discretion of the committee and are final binding and conclusive on the Company and all participants in the Plan.\nStock Options\nIncentive stock options and non-qualified stock options are granted pursuant to stock option award agreements adopted by the committee. The committee determines the exercise price for a stock option, within the terms and conditions of the Plan, provided that the exercise price shall not be less than (i) in the case of a grant of any NQSO or an ISO to a key employee who at the time of the grant does not own stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock or of any subsidiary, one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined on the date the stock option award is granted; (ii) in the case of a grant of an ISO to a key employee who, at the time of grant, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock or of any subsidiary, one hundred ten percent (110%) of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock , as determined on the date the stock option award is granted. The fair market value of the Common Stock for purposes of determining the exercise price shall be determined by the Committee in accordance with any reasonable method of valuation consistent with applicable requirements of Federal tax law, including, as applicable, the provisions of Code Section 422(c)(8) and 409A as applicable. Stock options granted under the Plan will become exercisable at the rate specified by the committee and may be exercisable for restricted stock, if determined by the committee.\nThe committee determines the term of stock options granted under the Plan, up to a maximum of ten years. The option holder\u2019s stock option agreement shall provide the rights, if any, that such holder has to exercise the stock option at such time that such holder\u2019s service relationship with us, or any of our affiliates, ceases for any reason, including disability, death, with or without cause, or voluntary resignation. All unvested stock option awards are forfeited if the participant\u2019s employment or service is terminated for any reason, unless our compensation committee determines otherwise.\nAcceptable consideration for the purchase of Common Stock issued upon the exercise of a stock option will be determined by the committee and may include (i) check, bank draft or money order or wire transfer, (ii) if the Company\u2019s Common Stock is publicly traded, a broker-assisted cashless exercise, or (iii) such other methods as may be approved by the committee, including without limitation, the tender of shares of our Common Stock previously owned by the option holder or a net exercise of the option.\nUnless the committee provides otherwise, options generally are not transferable except by will, the laws of descent and distribution. The committee may provide that a non-qualified stock option may be transferred to a family member, as such term is defined under the applicable securities laws.\nTax Limitations on Incentive Stock Options\nThe aggregate fair market value, determined at the time of grant, of our Common Stock with respect to incentive stock options that are exercisable for the first time by an option holder during any calendar year may not exceed $100,000. Options or portions thereof that exceed such limit will generally be treated as non-qualified stock options. No incentive stock option may be granted to any person who, at the time of the grant, owns or is deemed to own stock possessing more than 10% of our total combined voting power or that of any of our affiliates unless (i) the option exercise price is at least 110% of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option on the date of grant, and (ii) the term of the incentive stock option does not exceed five years from the date of grant.\nAdjustments for Changes in Capital Structure and other Special Transactions\nIn the event of a stock dividend, stock split, or recapitalization, or a corporate reorganization in which we are a surviving corporation (and our shareholders prior to such transaction continue to own at least 50% of our capital stock after such transaction), including without limitation a merger, consolidation, split-up or spin-off, or a liquidation, or distribution of securities or assets other than cash dividends, the number or kinds of shares subject to the Plan or to any stock option award previously granted, and the exercise price, shall be adjusted proportionately by the committee to reflect such event.\nIn the event of a merger, consolidation or other form of reorganization with or into another corporation (other than a merger, consolidation, or other form of reorganization in which we are the surviving corporation and our shareholders prior to such transaction continue to own at least 50% of the capital stock after such transaction), a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or a tender or exchange offer made by any corporation, person or entity (other than an offer made by us), all stock options held by any option holder shall be fully vested and exercisable by the option holder.\nFurthermore, the committee, either before or after the merger, consolidation or other form of reorganization, may take such action as it determines in its sole discretion with respect to the number or kinds of shares subject to the Plan or any option under the Plan.\nAmendment, Suspension or Termination\nThe committee may at any time amend, suspend or terminate any and all parts of the Plan, any stock option award granted under the Plan, or both in such respects as the committee shall deem necessary or desirable, except that no such action may be taken which would impair the rights of any option holder with respect to any stock option award previously granted under the Plan without the option holder\u2019s consent.\nDescription of Securities\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 275,000,000 shares, of which 250,000,000 shares are designated as Common Stock par value $.001 per share, and 25,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock, par value $.001 per share of which (i) no shares have been designated as Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) 1,764 shares have been designated as Series B Preferred Stock, (ii) 10,000 shares have been designated as Series C Preferred Stock and (iii) 2,000 shares have been designated as Series D Preferred Stock and 1,050 shares have been designated as Series E.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEquity Transactions\nDescription of the Matter:\nAs described in note 8 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company raised capital using convertible instruments which are inherently complex in nature. During the year ended December 31, 2020, these convertible instruments were converted into shares of common stock. These transactions converted into common shares in addition to triggering downround provisions and deemed dividends. The transactions required complex auditor judgment due to the number and the variety of the types of instruments and the subjectivity of assumptions used to value the transactions.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nAddressing the matter involved obtaining an understanding of the controls over the Company\u2019s process for issuing and recording equity. We assessed the appropriateness of judgments made by management in determining key assumptions used in the valuation of each equity transaction. We obtained and reviewed all material equity agreements and considered whether the recording was appropriate given the nature of the transaction. We recalculated the value of the amounts recorded based on management\u2019s key assumptions and on the related stock value at the time of the transaction. We agreed all material cash consideration received in equity raises to the Company\u2019s bank statements. We also tested the accuracy and the completeness of the disclosure of the transactions.\n/s/ WithumSmith+Brown, PC\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2020.\nOrlando, Florida\nMarch 31, 2021\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of AgEagle Aerial Systems, Inc.\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of AgEagle Aerial Systems, Inc.

With our founding premise rooted in high performance, next-level thinking, and technological innovation, AgEagle is intent on ensuring that new standards for quality U.S. manufacturing and the provision of precision-crafted, purpose-built drone systems and solutions are delivered to empower our customers to thrive and prosper in The Drone Age. \u2122\nFounded in 2010, AgEagle was originally formed to pioneer proprietary, professional-grade, fixed-wing drones and aerial imagery-based data collection and analytics solutions for the agriculture industry. In addition to selling our innovative drones to the precision and sustainable farming markets, AgEagle\u2019s innovative data collection and analytics solutions have processed more than two million acres of crops, analyzing data that seeks to adopt and support productive agricultural approaches to improve farming practices which currently limit the impact on our natural resources, reduce reliance on inputs and materially increase crop yields and profits.\nIn the first half of 2019, the Company introduced HempOverview, a scalable, responsive and cost-effective Software-as-a-Solution (\u201cSaaS\u201d) web- and map-based technology platform to support the operations of domestic industrial hemp programs for state and tribal nation departments of agriculture - a solution that provides users with what the Company believes is the gold standard for regulatory oversight, operational assistance and reporting capabilities for the fast emerging industrial hemp industry.\nOver the past decade, the broader drone market has continued to evolve and expand. As a result, economic and productivity benefits made possible by drones is fueling global demand for high quality, safe and reliable drone systems and solutions for commercial applications well beyond agriculture. In response, AgEagle is now leveraging our technological expertise and drone engineering and manufacturing experience to penetrate new, high growth market sectors; namely, drone package delivery, public safety/security, large venue decontamination and infrastructure/inspection, among other high growth market opportunities.\nAgEagle\u2019s key growth objectives are centered on three primary areas of focus:\n1) Ag Solutions: Leveraging our reputation as one of the leading technology solutions providers to the agriculture industry to increase market share through delivery of best-in-class drones, sensors and data analytics for hemp and other commercial crops;\n2) Drone Manufacturing: Establishing AgEagle as the dominant commercial drone design, engineering, manufacturing, assembly and testing company in the United States; and\n3) Drone Solutions: Establishing the Company as one of the industry\u2019s leading American-made trusted source for turnkey, end-to-end, tailored drone solutions to the world.\nWe intend to grow our business by preserving a leadership position in our core Ag Solutions business; providing quality contract manufacturing, assembly, and testing services; and innovating new customer-focused drone systems and solutions to capture significant share of the broader commercial drone market. In addition, we expect to accelerate our growth and expansion through strategic acquisitions of drone-related companies offering distinct technological and competitive advantages and have defensible IP protection in place, if applicable.\nAGEAGLE AERIAL SYSTEMS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019\nNote 1 - Description of Business - Continued\nThe Company is headquartered in Wichita, Kansas.\nCorporate History; Recent Business Combinations\nOn March 26, 2018, our predecessor company, EnerJex Resources, Inc. (\u201cEnerJex\u201d), a Nevada company, consummated the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d), dated October 19, 2017, pursuant to which AgEagle Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of EnerJex, merged with and into AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc., a privately held company organized under the laws of the state of Nevada (\u201cAgEagle Sub\u201d), with AgEagle Sub surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of EnerJex (the \u201cMerger\u201d). In connection with the Merger, EnerJex changed its name to AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc. (the \u201cCompany, \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) and AgEagle Sub changed its name initially to \u201cEagle Aerial, Inc. and then to\u201d AgEagle Aerial, Inc. Prior to this merger all of the EnerJex operations were conducted through EnerJex Kansas, Inc., Black Sable Energy, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (\u201cBlack Sable\u201d) and Black Raven Energy, Inc. a Nevada corporation (\u201cBlack Raven\u201d). Its leasehold interests were held in its wholly-owned subsidiaries Black Sable, Working Interest, LLC, EnerJex Kansas and Black Raven. Black Sable, Black Raven and Working Interest, LLC were all dissolved as of the end of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company continues with the wholly-owned subsidiaries AgEagle Aerial, Inc. and Enerjex Kansas, Inc.\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation - These financial consolidated statements are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected a December 31 fiscal year end.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries AgEagle Aerial, Inc. and EnerJex Kansas, Inc. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Such consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company\u2019s management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d) in all material respects and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company discovered errors in the income tax provision as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. These errors relate to computing the deferred tax assets using a blended state and federal tax rate and also computing a deferred tax asset using the incorrect amount of net operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. The total of these errors were offset by incorrectly increasing the valuation allowance by the same amount. The adjustment was to decrease the deferred tax asset by $1,130,297 and to decrease the valuation allowance by the same amount. Since there was no impact to the Company\u2019s net loss or the Company\u2019s equity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 the Company has determined that these errors were not material to the consolidated financial statements. The deferred tax asset and valuation allowance has been cumulatively adjusted as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 to correct these errors and the impact of these changes are included in the reconciliation of income tax disclosure for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the reserve for obsolete inventory, valuation of stock issued for services and stock options, valuation of intangible assets and the valuation of deferred tax assets.\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures-The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) requires companies to determine fair value based on the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability to a market participant. The Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement.\nAGEAGLE AERIAL SYSTEMS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies -- Continued\nThe guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:\n\u25cf Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\u25cf Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\n\u25cf Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\nWe have no assets or liabilities that are required to have their fair value measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2020 or 2019. Long-lived assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and are subject to fair value adjustments when there is evidence of impairment.\nFor short-term classes of our financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable and accounts payable, and which are not reported at fair value, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. Additionally, the Note payable is carried at face value, which approximates fair value, due to the government backed security which requires payments however management is expecting to apply for and receive full forgiveness during 2021 (See Note 7).\nConcentrations -The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) up to $250,000. The Company\u2019s bank balances at times may exceed the FDIC limit. To date, the Company has not experienced any losses on its invested cash.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was one significant vendor that the Company relies upon to perform stitching its FarmLens platform. This vendor provides services to the Company which can be replaced by alternative vendors should the need arise.\nReceivables and Credit Policy - Trade receivables due from customers are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms requiring payment within 30 days from the invoice date. Terms with our distributor allow for payment terms of 45 days from the invoice date. Trade receivables are stated at the amount billed to the customer. The Company generally does not charge interest on overdue customer account balances. Payments of trade receivables are allocated to the specific invoices identified on the customer\u2019s remittance advice or, if unspecified, are applied to the earliest unpaid invoices. Accounts receivable at January 1, 2019 was $93.\nThe Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an evaluation of the current status of receivables, historical experience, and other factors as necessary. It is reasonably possible that the Company\u2019s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change. The Company determined that no allowance was necessary as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nAGEAGLE AERIAL SYSTEMS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nInventories - Inventories, which consist of raw materials, finished goods and work-in-process, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined by the average-cost method, which approximates the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include direct materials and direct labor, as well as in-bound freight. At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation primarily includes an analysis of forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, among consideration of other factors. The physical condition (e.g., age and quality) of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation. Based upon the evaluation, provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. Once established, write-downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the respective inventories. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the amounts that the Company may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels, product discontinuances, sales return levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company\u2019s estimates and expectations. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, the Company had recorded a provision for obsolescence of $10,000.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets - The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable.\nIntangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure fair value, which ranges from four to five years.\nBusiness Combinations - The Company recognizes, with certain exceptions, 100% of the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity. Shares issued in consideration for a business combination, contingent consideration arrangements and pre-acquisition loss and gain contingencies are all measured and recorded at their acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes to fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are generally reflected in earnings. Any in-process research and development assets acquired are capitalized as of the acquisition date. Acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. The operating results of entities acquired are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition.\nRevenue Recognition and Concentration - The majority of the Company\u2019s revenue is generated pursuant to written contractual arrangements to develop, manufacture and/or modify complex drone related products, and to provide associated engineering, technical and other services according to customer specifications. These contracts are a fixed price and are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d). Under fixed-price contracts, the Company agrees to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent the Company\u2019s actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, it will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. The Company accounts for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.\nAGEAGLE AERIAL SYSTEMS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nThe Company generally recognizes revenue on sales to customers, dealers and distributors upon satisfaction of performance obligations which generally occurs once controls transfer to customers, which is when product is shipped or delivered depending on specific shipping terms. Additionally, customers are required to place a deposit or pay upon shipping for each UAV or drone delivery assembly part ordered. Customer payments received in advance of the Company completing performance obligations are recorded as contract liabilities.\nThe Company\u2019s FarmLens platform is offered on subscription basis for processing aerial imaging. These subscription fees are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period as the services are provided.\nSales concentration information for customers comprising more than 10% of the Company\u2019s total net sales such customers is summarized below:\nThere were no accounts receivable from Customer A due as of December 31, 2020. Accounts receivable due from Customer A comprised all of the accounts receivable as of December 31, 2019.\nThe table below reflects our revenue for the years indicated by product mix.\nShipping Costs - Shipping costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $6,122, and $5,493, respectively. All shipping costs billed directly to the customer are directly offset to shipping costs resulting in a net expense to the Company which is included in cost of goods sold on the accompanying statements of operations.\nResearch and Development Expenses - Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and are included as part of the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Research and development costs totaled $29,392 and $38,948 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nLoss Per Common Share - Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus Common Stock equivalents (if dilutive) related to warrants, options and convertible instruments.\nPotentially Dilutive Securities - The Company has excluded all common equivalent shares outstanding for warrants, options and convertible instruments to purchase Common Stock from the calculation of diluted net loss per share, because all such securities are anti-dilutive for the periods presented. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had 2,516,778 warrants and 2,255,267 options to purchase Common Stock. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had 4,531,924 warrants, 2,480,470 options to purchase Common Stock, and 3,501 shares of Series C Preferred Stock which may be converted into 6,483,333 shares of Common Stock.\nAGEAGLE AERIAL SYSTEMS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nLeases - The Company accounts for its operating leases in accordance with FASB Account Standards Update 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842) Lessees recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all their leases. to the Company recognizes assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease.\nIncome Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. This topic requires an asset and liability approach for accounting for income taxes. The Company evaluates its tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken on income tax returns to determine if an accrual is necessary for uncertain tax positions. The Company will recognize future accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense if incurred. All income tax returns not filed more than three years ago are subject to federal and state tax examinations by tax authorities.\nStock-Based Compensation Awards - The Company accounts for its stock-based awards in accordance with ASC Subtopic 718-10, \u201cCompensation - Stock Compensation\u201d, which requires fair value measurement on the grant date and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and directors. For stock options, the Company estimates the fair value using a closed option valuation (Black-Scholes) model. The estimated fair value is then expensed over the requisite service period of the award which is generally the vesting period and the related amount is recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within general and administrative expenses. The Company recognizes forfeitures at the time they occur.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of certain assumptions that require the Company\u2019s judgment, including the expected term and the expected stock price volatility of the underlying stock. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation represent management\u2019s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change resulting in the use of different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nUncertainty--The recent outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus is impacting worldwide economic activity. COVID-19 poses the risk that we or our employees, CROs, suppliers, manufacturers and other partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to the spread of the disease or shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that COVID-19 could have on our business, the continued spread of COVID-19 could disrupt our clinical trials, supply chain and the manufacture or shipment of our cyclodextrin products, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we have not yet experienced any material disruptions in our business or other negative consequences relating to COVID-19, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. See Note 7.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nAdopted\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). The updated simplifies the process for assessing goodwill impairment. The amended guidance removes the second step that was previously required. Under this ASU, impairment charges to goodwill are based on the excess of a reporting unit\u2019s carrying value to its fair value. ASU 2017-04 is effective for the Company in its fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. In 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2017-04 and applied the guidance to its annual impairment test (see Note 6).\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820). This ASU removes or modifies current disclosures while adding certain new disclosure requirements. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted for the removed or modified disclosures. The removed and modified disclosures can be adopted retrospectively, and the added disclosures should be adopted prospectively. The Company\u2019s adoption of ASU No. 2018-13 effective December 15, 2019 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nAGEAGLE AERIAL SYSTEMS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Continued\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (Topic 350-40). This ASU allows for capitalization of implementation costs associated with certain cloud computing arrangements. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. The Company\u2019s adoption of ASU No. 2018-15 effective December 15, 2019 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nPending Adoption\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), which provides guidance on how an entity should measure credit losses on financial instruments. The ASU is effective for smaller reporting company\u2019s for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments in ASU 2019-12 simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles and clarifying a handful of narrow issues within the broad topic of income tax accounting. The amendments in ASU 2019-12 are effective for years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nOther recent accounting pronouncements issued by FASB did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s present or future consolidated financial statements.\nNote 3 - Inventories\nInventories consist of the following at:\nNote 4 - Notes Receivable\nOn October 14, 2020, in connection with, and as an incentive to the entry into a two-year exclusive manufacturing agreement to produce a patented Drone Delivery Station for Valqari LLC (\u201cValqari\u201d), AgEagle Aerial Systems, Inc.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019\nNote 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets -- Continued\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test using a quantitative approach by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to its fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) (Level 3 input) analysis and market-based valuation methodology such as comparable public company trading values. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant trading multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on estimates of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, existing firm orders, expected future orders, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The DCF analysis used a discount rate of 13%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the fair value of the reporting unit was found to be less than its carrying value and the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $162,984 which is included in general and administrative expense on the statements of operations.\nFor purposes of testing the finite-lived intangible assets the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group was compared to the asset group\u2019s carrying value. Based on the impairment test for the goodwill and finite-lived intangibles assets related to the SaaS reporting unit no impairment exists for those assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company will continue to amortize the related finite-intangible asset over their estimated useful lives.\nNote 7 - Promissory Note\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company received a loan in the amount of $107,439 from the Small Business Administration (SBA) as part of Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act\u2019s Paycheck Protection Plan (PPP). The loan is unsecured, nonrecourse, accrues interest at one percent per annum, with a due date of May 6, 2022. Under the terms of the loan, a portion or all of the loan is forgivable to the extent that the loan proceeds are used to fund qualifying payroll, rent and utilities during a designated twenty-four-week period through October 21, 2020.\nThe unforgiven portion of the PPP loan is payable over two years and can be extended to five years if agreed upon by both parties and bears interest at a rate of 1%, with a deferral of payments for the first six months. The Company intends to use the proceeds for purposes consistent with the PPP.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019\nNote 8 - Equity\nSeries C Preferred Stock\nEach share of Series C Preferred Stock is convertible into a number of shares of our Common Stock equal to the quotient determined by dividing (x) the stated value of $1,000 per share, by (y) a conversion price of $0.54. Until the volume weighted average price of our Common Stock on NYSE exceeds $107.50 with average trading volume of 200,000 shares per day for ten consecutive trading days, the conversion price of our Series C Preferred Stock is subject to full-ratchet, anti-dilution price protection. Under that provision, if, while that full-ratchet, anti-dilution price protection is in effect, the Company issues shares of our Common Stock at a price per share (the \u201cDilutive Price\u201d) that is less than the conversion price, then the conversion price of our Series C Preferred Stock is automatically reduced to be equal to the Dilutive Price. The effect of that reduction is that, upon the issuance of shares of Common Stock at a Dilutive Price, the Series C Preferred Stock would be convertible into a greater number of shares of our Common Stock.\nThe Series C preferred stock anti-dilution protection was initially triggered on December 27, 2018 as a result of the Company issuing the Series D Preferred Stock, (the \u201cSeries D Preferred Stock\u201d) as described below. The Series D Preferred Stock had a $0.54 conversion price thereby qualifying as a subsequent equity offering at a price less than $1.53.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, Alpha Capital Anstalt (\u201cAlpha\u201d) converted a total of 1,161 shares of Series C Preferred Stock into 2,150,000 shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $.54.\nDuring the month of January 2020, Alpha converted 189 shares of Series C Preferred Stock into 350,000 shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.54.\nOn April 7, 2020, upon the issuance of the Series E Preferred Stock, (the \u201cSeries E Preferred Stock\u201d) offering (see below), a subsequent anti-dilution provision was triggered for the Series C Preferred Stock whereby the conversion price was further adjusted from $0.54 per share to $0.25 per share (a \u201cDown Round), which resulted in approximately 13,248,000 shares of common stock being issuable upon conversion of the remaining Series C Preferred Stock. As a result of this Down Round being triggered, the Company recorded a deemed dividend in the amount of $3,841,920 representing the intrinsic spread between the previous conversion price of $.54 and the adjusted conversion price of $.25 multiplied by 13,248,000 common stock shares issuable upon conversion. The deemed dividend was recorded as a reduction of retained earnings and increase in additional paid-in-capital and increased the net loss to common stockholders by the same amount in computing earnings per share.\nDuring the month of April 2020, Alpha converted 3,312 shares of Series C Preferred Stock into 13,247,984 shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.25. As of December 31, 2020, no Series C Preferred Stock remain issued and outstanding.\nSeries D Preferred Stock\nOn December 27, 2018, the Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreement (the \u201cSeries D Purchase Agreement\u201d) with an Investor (the \u201cPurchaser\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (the \u201cBoard\u201d) designated a new series of preferred stock, the Series D Preferred Stock, which is non-convertible and provides for an 8% annual dividend and is subject to optional redemption by the Company (the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d). The Company issued 2,000 shares of Preferred Stock and a warrant (the \u201cWarrant\u201d) to purchase 3,703,703 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share of Common Stock, for $2,000,000 in gross proceeds. The shares of Common Stock underling the Warrant are referred to as the \u201cWarrant Shares\u201d. The Company also entered into a registration rights agreement (the \u201cRegistration Rights Agreement\u201d) granting registration rights to the Purchaser with respect to the Series D Warrant Shares.\nThe Series D Purchase Agreement provides that upon a subsequent financing or financings with net proceeds of at least $500,000, the Company must exercise its optional redemption of the Preferred Stock and apply any and all net proceeds from such financing(s) to the redemption in full of the Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock is nonconvertible, provides for an 8% annual dividend payable semi-annually, and has liquidation rights senior to the Common Stock, but pari passu with the Company\u2019s Series C Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock has no voting rights, except that the Company shall not undertake certain corporate actions as set forth in the Certificate of Designation that would materially impact the holders of Preferred Stock without their consent.\nThe Preferred Stock is subject to optional redemption by the Company at 115% of the stated value of the Preferred Stock outstanding at the time of such redemption, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends and all liquidated damages or other amounts due. Any such optional redemption may only be exercised after giving notice and upon satisfaction of certain equity conditions set forth in the Certificate of Designation, including (i) all dividends, liquidated damages and other amounts have been paid; (ii) there is an effective registration statement covering the Warrant Shares, or the Warrant Shares can be exercised through a cashless exercise without restriction under Rule 144, (iii) the Warrant Shares are listed on an exchange, (iv) the holder is not in possession of material, non-public information, (v) there is a sufficient number of authorized shares for issuance of all Warrant Shares, and (vi) for each trading day in a period of 20 consecutive trading days prior to the redemption date, the daily trading volume for the Common Stock on the principal trading market exceeds $200,000 per trading day.\nAGEAGLE AERIAL SYSTEMS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019\nNote 8 - Equity - Continued\nOn April 7, 2020, upon the issuance of the Series E Preferred Stock, (the \u201cSeries E Preferred Stock\u201d) offering (see below), a subsequent anti-dilution provision was triggered for the Series D Warrants whereby the exercise price of the Warrant Shares was adjusted from $0.54 to $0.25 per share (a \u201cWarrant Down Round). Upon the Warrant Down Round being triggered, the Company recognized $208,918 of a deemed dividend for the difference between the fair value of the original warrants right before modification and the fair value of the modified warrants. The fair value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following assumptions: expected life of 3.5 years, expected dividend rate of 0%, volatility of 90.0%, and an interest rate of 0.29%. The deemed dividend to the preferred stockholders was a recorded as additional paid in capital and a reduction of retained earnings and as an increase to net loss attributable to Common Stockholders in computing earnings per share on the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn June 5, 2020, the Company and Alpha entered into a letter agreement whereby they agreed to amend the Original Series D Preferred Stock and terminate the Series D Purchase Agreement. Alpha is a current holder of less than 10% of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding Common Stock and has no material relationship with the Company.\nOn June 5, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to the Original Series D Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation for Nevada Profit Corporations with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada (the \u201cOriginal Series D Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation\u201d). The amendment among other things, (i) provided for the ability of the Holder to convert the Original Series D, including all accrued, but unpaid dividends on the Original Series D, into shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share of the Company, (ii) set a conversion price at $0.54 per share (subject to customary adjustments), and (iii) increased the stated value of the Original Series D from $1,000 to $1,116.67. The Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation of the Series D Preferred Stock was filed with the Secretary of the State of Nevada effective as of June 8, 2020.\nThe holder of the Original Series D approved the amendment to the Original Series D. There is no class or series of stock which is senior to the Original Series D as to the payment of distributions upon dissolution of the Company, and therefore the approval of any other class or series of stock of the Company to the amendments to the Original Series D Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation is not required pursuant to Nevada law.\nOn the date of the above amendment to the Original Series D Preferred Stock the fair value of the Company\u2019s Common Stock price was $1.45 which is higher than the effective conversion price of $0.54 that was agreed to on June 5, 2020. Due to the modification of the Series D Preferred Stock, the Company recorded a deemed dividend of $3,763,591 representing the intrinsic value of $0.91 multiplied by the number of Common Stock shares to be issued upon conversion. The deemed dividend to the preferred stockholders was a recorded as additional paid in capital and a reduction of retained earnings and has an increase to net loss attributable to Common Stockholders in computing earnings per share.\nDuring the month of June 2020, the Series D Preferred Stockholder converted 1,890 shares of Series D Preferred Stock and all outstanding accrued dividends totaling $233,333 into 3,500,000 shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.54.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2020, the Series D Preferred Stockholders converted the remaining 110 shares of the Series D Preferred Stock into 635,815 shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.54 which includes an additional 421,308 of Common Stock shares to correct conversions that occurred in June 2020 computed using the stated value of $1,000 rather than $1,116.67.\nAGEAGLE AERIAL SYSTEMS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019\nNote 8 - Equity - Continued\nSeries E Preferred Stock\nOn April 7, 2020, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the \u201cSeries E Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Alpha, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized 1,050 shares of a newly designated series of preferred stock, the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock was convertible at $0.25 per share into an aggregate of 4,200,000 shares of the Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share. The purchase price for the Preferred Stock was $1,050,000 of which the Company received net proceeds of $1,010,000. The Preferred Stock has liquidation rights senior to the Common Stock, but pari passu with the Series C Preferred Stock and the Series D Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock has no voting rights. The conversion price adjusts for stock splits and combinations and is subject to anti-dilution protection for subsequent equity issuances until such time as no shares of Series E Preferred Stock are outstanding. The Certificate of Designation of the Series E Convertible Preferred Stock was filed with the State of Nevada on April 2, 2020. The Company also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, granting registration rights to Alpha with respect to the Conversion Shares and Common Stock underlying warrants currently owned by Alpha.\nOn the date that the Series E Preferred Stock was consummated the fair value of the Company\u2019s Common Stock price was $0.37 which is higher than the effective conversion price of $0.25 that was agreed to on April 7, 2020. As a result, the Company recognized a beneficial conversion feature (\u201cBCF\u201d) of $378,240 on 788 of Preferred Shares representing the intrinsic value of $.12 multiplied by the number of Common Stock shares to be issued upon conversion. The remaining amount of 262 shares was repurchased as described below. The discount to the Series E Preferred Stock resulting from the BCF has been presented as an increase to net loss attributable to Common Stockholders in computing earnings per share on the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn May 11, 2020, the Company entered into a Series E Purchase Agreement for the sale of Common Stock as described above with Alpha whereby we agreed to repurchase 262 shares of Series E Preferred Stock with the proceeds from the new issuance. The repurchase of the Preferred Series E Stock was convertible into 1,048,000 shares of Common Stock at a repurchase price of $1.06 per share. The Company increased its net loss available to Common Stockholders in computing earnings per share for the excess of the consideration paid for the Series E Preferred Stock over its carrying value totaling $848,880. As of December 31, 2020, no Series E Preferred Stock remain issued and outstanding.\nCapital Stock Issuances\nOn May 3, 2019, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with GreenBlock Capital LLC (\u201cConsultant\u201d) (see Note 10).

The Company uses its incremental borrowing rates as the discount rate for its leases, which is equal to the rate of interest the Company would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. The incremental borrowing rate for all existing leases as of the opening balance sheet date was based upon the remaining terms of the leases; the incremental borrowing rate for all new or amended leases is based upon the lease terms. The lease terms for all the Company\u2019s leases include the contractually obligated period of the leases, plus any additional periods covered by a Company options to extend the leases that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise.\nAdoption of Topic 842 did not have a material impact on our annual operating results or cash flows. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in operating costs or General and administrative expense. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception and recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less but greater than one month are not recorded on the balance sheet for select asset classes. The lease liability is measured at the present value of future lease payments as of the lease commencement date, or the opening balance sheet date for leases existing at adoption of Topic 842. The right-of-use asset recognized is based on the lease liability adjusted for prepaid and deferred rent and unamortized lease incentives.\nThe Company has one operating lease located at 8863 E. 34th Street North, Wichita, Kansas 67226 which serves as our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility. The commencement date of the lease was November 1, 2020 and will expire on October 31, 2023, unless sooner terminated or extended. The lease which is an operating lease and included in the right-of-use asset, current portion of lease liability, and long-term lease liability captions on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet.\nThe aggregate estimated rent payments due over the initial three-year term is $297,000. Operating lease assets are recorded net of accumulated amortization of $257,363 as of December 31, 2020. Lease expense for lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. The aggregate estimated rent payments due over the option term would be $314,640. Lease expense payment was $48,840 and $30,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which is included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe following is a maturity analysis of the annual undiscounted cash flows of the operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020:\nPreviously the Company leased manufacturing space located at 117 South 4th Street, Neodesha, Kansas 66757. This served as our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility. The facility was a lease of 4,000 square feet at a cost of $600 per month. This lease was officially terminated on November 30, 2020.\nAs a result of an asset acquisition, the Company assumed a lease for offices in Boulder, Colorado for $2,000 a month. The lease was officially terminated on November 30, 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and our intention to protect the health and safety of our employees, our workforce in Colorado has been working from their respective home offices. Once the nation\u2019s vaccination program gains greater momentum or herd immunity is achieved, we do expect to lease new commercial office space in or around Denver, Colorado, which may occur later this year.\nGreenBlock Capital LLC Consulting Agreement\nOn May 3, 2019, we entered into a consulting agreement with GreenBlock Capital LLC (\u201cConsultant\u201d) to serve as strategic advisor and consultant with respect to the development of new business opportunities and the implementation of business strategies related to expansion into the emerging domestic hemp cultivation market.

There are no early termination penalties incurred as a result of the termination of the consulting agreement. The Consultant may still be entitled to receive up to 2,500,000 shares of restricted Common Stock after termination of the Agreement, if the achievement of milestones that commenced during the term of the Agreement are completed after termination.\nIn February 2021, the Consultant sent a demand letter to the Company alleging a breach of the consulting agreement due to the Company not issuing additional shares of common stock in connection with the Consultant\u2019s alleged achievement of the milestones. At this time the Consultant made a demand for an additional 750,000 shares of common stock to be issued. Although the Company disputes that the milestones were successfully achieved by the Consultant and believes that no additional shares of common stock are owed, the Company has offered to the Consultant, in the form of a settlement, 250,000 additional shares of common stock. As result the Company has recorded a contingent loss within general & administrative expenses in the aggregate amount of $1,500,000 based upon the fair market value of $6.00 per share of the Company\u2019s common stock as of December 31, 2020. If the offer is not accepted, and a complaint is filed, the Company intends to vigorously defend the matter to the fullest extent.\nFounder Leak-Out Agreement\nOn April 7, 2020, as a condition to the consummation of the Series E Preferred Agreement, the Company entered into a Leak-Out Agreement with Mr. Bret Chilcott, founder and former director and President of the Company, and Alpha with respect to the shares Mr. Chilcott beneficially owns.

The Amended Leak Out Agreement provides that Mr. Chilcott (together with his affiliates) may sell or otherwise dispose of his shares for a period of twelve (12) months commencing on September 7, 2020 (the \u201cRestricted Period\u201d) in an amount representing no more than 50,000 shares per calendar month during the Restricted Period.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019\nNote 12 - Income Taxes\nPrior to April 15, 2015, AgEagle Aerial Inc. was treated as a disregarded entity for income tax purposes. Income taxes, if any, were the responsibility of the sole member. In April 2015, the Company elected to be classified as a corporation for income tax purposes, effective on April 22, 2015. Following the merger in 2018, AgEagle Aerial Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of AgEagle Aerial Systems, Inc. and the group files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return as well as income tax returns in various states.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes which requires the Company to provide a net deferred tax asset or liability equal to the expected future tax benefit or expense of temporary reporting differences between book and tax accounting and any available operating loss or tax credit carryforwards. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, the total of all net deferred tax assets was $3,277,467 and $2,779,100, respectively. The amount of and ultimate realization of the benefits from the deferred tax assets for income tax purposes is dependent, in part, upon the tax laws in effect, the Company\u2019s future earnings, and other future events, the effects of which cannot be determined. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the deferred tax assets the Company has established a valuation allowance of $3,277,467 and $2,779,100 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change in the valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $498,368 and $1,378,480, respectively.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, provides for an acceleration of alternative minimum tax credit refunds, the deferral of certain employer payroll taxes, the availability of an employee retention credit, and expands the availability of net operating loss usage. In addition, other governments in state and local in which we operate have also enacted certain relief measures.\nOn December 27,2020, the Consolidations Appropriations Act, 2021 (\u201cCAA\u201d) was signed into law and included in the government appropriations and additional economic stimulus. The CAA enhances and expands certain provisions of the CARES Act. The CAA modifies the tax deductibility of expenses relating to the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) loan forgiveness, Employee Retention Credit eligibility and extends other CARES Act provisions. We continue to monitor new and updated legislation, however the provisions enacted have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company has a federal and state net operating loss carry forward of approximately $11,982,988 and $10,193,848 respectively. Of those balances, the Company has $2,043,672 of federal net operating losses expiring in 2035-2037 and the remaining amounts have no expiration. The Company has state net operating loss carry forwards of $7,263,378 expiring in 2025-2030 and the remaining amounts have no expiration. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had a federal and state net operating loss carryforward of $6,606,771 and $6,397,792, respectively. The Act changed the rules on net operating loss carry forwards. The 20-year limitation was eliminated for losses incurred after January 1, 2018, giving the taxpayer the ability to carry forward losses indefinitely. However, net operating loss carry forward arising after January 1, 2018, will now be limited to 80 percent of taxable income.\nThe timing and manner in which we can utilize our net operating loss carry forward and future income tax deductions in any year may be limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code regarding the change in ownership of corporations. Such limitation may have an impact on the ultimate realization of our carry forwards and future tax deductions. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d) imposes limitations on a corporation\u2019s ability to utilize net operating losses if it experiences an \u201cownership change.\u201d In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years, and the amount of the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by the built-in gains in assets held by us at the time of the change that are recognized in the five-year period after the change. The Company has not conducted a formal ownership change analysis as required under Section 382; however, we intend to do so if we anticipate recognizing tax benefits associated with the net operating loss carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have determined it is more likely than not that we will not realize our temporary deductible differences and net operating loss carryforwards and have provided a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. For 2020 and 2019, we did not recognize any uncertain tax positions, interest or penalty expense related to income taxes. We file U.S. federal and state income tax returns as necessary. The federal return generally has a three-year statute of limitations and most states have a four-year statute of limitations; however, the taxing authorities can review the tax year in which the net operating loss was generated when the loss is utilized on a tax return. We currently do not have any open income tax audits. The Company is open to federal and state examination on the 2017 through 2019 income tax returns filed.\nA reconciliation of income tax expense at the federal statutory rate to income tax expense at the Company\u2019s effective rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nThe temporary differences, tax credits and carryforwards that gave rise to the following deferred tax assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nAGEAGLE AERIAL SYSTEMS INC.
