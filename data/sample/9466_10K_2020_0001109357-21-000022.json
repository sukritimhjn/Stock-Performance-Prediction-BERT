    "item_1": "ITEM 1.\nGeneral\nCorporate Structure and Business and Other Information\nExelon is a utility services holding company engaged in the generation, delivery, and marketing of energy through Generation and the energy distribution and transmission businesses through ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE.\nOn February 21, 2021, Exelon\u2019s Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Utility Registrants and Generation, creating two publicly traded companies with the resources necessary to best serve customers and sustain long-term investment and operating excellence. The separation gives each company the financial and strategic independence to focus on its specific customer needs, while executing its core business strategy. See Note 26 - Subsequent Events of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nBusiness Services\nThrough its business services subsidiary, BSC, Exelon provides its subsidiaries with a variety of support services at cost, including legal, human resources, financial, information technology, and supply management services. PHI also has a business services subsidiary, PHISCO, which provides a variety of support services at cost, including legal, accounting, engineering, customer operations, distribution and transmission planning, asset management, system operations, and power procurement, to PHI operating companies. The costs of BSC and PHISCO are directly charged or allocated to the applicable subsidiaries. The results of Exelon\u2019s corporate operations are presented as \u201cOther\u201d within the consolidated financial statements and include intercompany eliminations unless otherwise disclosed.\nGeneration\nGeneration, one of the largest competitive electric generation companies in the United States as measured by owned and contracted MW, physically delivers and markets power across multiple geographic regions through its customer-facing business, Constellation. Constellation sells electricity and natural gas, including renewable energy, in competitive energy markets to both wholesale and retail customers. Generation leverages its energy generation portfolio to ensure delivery of energy to both wholesale and retail customers under long-term and short-term contracts, and in wholesale power markets. Generation operates in well-developed energy markets and employs an integrated hedging strategy to manage commodity price volatility. Generation's fleet also provides geographic and supply source diversity. Generation\u2019s customers include distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, financial institutions, and commercial, industrial, governmental, and residential customers in competitive markets. Generation\u2019s customer-facing activities foster development and delivery of other innovative energy-related products and services for its customers.\nGeneration is a public utility under the Federal Power Act and is subject to FERC\u2019s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Under the Federal Power Act, FERC has the authority to grant or deny market-based rates for sales of energy, capacity, and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable. FERC\u2019s jurisdiction over ratemaking includes the authority to suspend the market-based rates of utilities and set cost-based rates should FERC find that its previous grant of market-based rates authority is no longer just and reasonable. Other matters subject to FERC jurisdiction include, but are not limited to, third-party financings; review of mergers; dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility; affiliate transactions; intercompany financings and cash management arrangements; certain internal corporate reorganizations; and certain holding company acquisitions of public utility and holding company securities.\nRTOs and ISOs exist in a number of regions to provide transmission service across multiple transmission systems. FERC has approved PJM, MISO, ISO-NE, and SPP as RTOs and CAISO and NYISO as ISOs. These entities are responsible for regional planning, managing transmission congestion, developing wholesale markets for energy and capacity, maintaining reliability, market monitoring, the scheduling of physical power sales brokered through ICE and NYMEX, and the elimination or reduction of redundant transmission charges imposed by multiple transmission providers when wholesale customers take transmission service across several transmission systems. ERCOT is not subject to regulation by FERC but performs a similar function in Texas to that performed by RTOs in markets regulated by FERC.\nSpecific operations of Generation are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal, state, regional, and local agencies, including the NRC, and Federal and state environmental protection agencies. Additionally, Generation is subject to NERC mandatory reliability standards, which protect the nation\u2019s bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches.\nGenerating Resources\nAt December 31, 2020, the generating resources of Generation consisted of the following:\n__________\n(a)See \u201cFuel\u201d for sources of fuels used in electric generation.\n(b)Net generation capacity is stated at proportionate ownership share. See ITEM 2. PROPERTIES-Generation for additional information.\n(c)Includes wind, hydroelectric, solar, and biomass generation.\n(d)Electric supply procured under site specific agreements.\nGeneration has five reportable segments, as described in the table below, representing the different geographical areas in which Generation\u2019s owned generating resources are located and Generation's customer-facing activities are conducted.\n__________\n(a)Net generation capacity is stated at proportionate ownership share. See ITEM 2. PROPERTIES-Generation for additional information.\nNuclear Facilities\nGeneration has ownership interests in thirteen nuclear generating stations currently in service, consisting of 23 units with an aggregate of 18,880 MW of capacity. These stations include FitzPatrick located in Scriba, New York, which was acquired on March 31, 2017 and exclude TMI located in Middletown, Pennsylvania, which permanently ceased generation operations on September 20, 2019 and Oyster Creek located in Forked River, New Jersey, which permanently ceased generation operations on September 17, 2018 and was subsequently sold to Holtec International (Holtec) on July 1, 2019. Generation wholly owns all of its nuclear generating stations, except for undivided ownership interests in three jointly-owned nuclear stations: Quad Cities (75% ownership), Peach Bottom (50% ownership), and Salem (42.59% ownership), which are consolidated in Exelon\u2019s and Generation's financial statements relative to its proportionate ownership interest in each unit, and a 50.01% membership interest in CENG, a joint venture with EDF, which wholly owns the Calvert Cliffs and Ginna nuclear stations and Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in addition to an 82% undivided ownership interest in Nine Mile Point Unit 2. CENG is 100% consolidated in Exelon's and Generation's financial statements.\nGeneration and EDF entered into a Put Option Agreement on April 1, 2014, pursuant to which EDF has an option to sell its 49.99% equity interest in CENG to Generation. The put option became exercisable on January 1, 2016 and may be exercised any time until June 30, 2022. On November 20, 2019, Generation received notice of EDF\u2019s intention to exercise the put option and sell its ownership share in CENG to Generation and the put automatically exercised on January 19, 2020 at the end of the sixty-day advance notice period. At this time, Generation cannot reasonably predict the ultimate purchase price that will be paid to EDF for its interest in CENG. The transaction will require approval by the NYPSC and the FERC. The FERC approval was obtained on July 30, 2020. From the date the put was exercised, the process and regulatory approvals could take one to two years to complete.\nSee ITEM 2. PROPERTIES for additional information on Generation's nuclear facilities, Note 2 - Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the disposition of Oyster Creek, and Note 23 - Variable Interest Entities of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the CENG consolidation.\nGeneration\u2019s nuclear generating stations are all operated by Generation, with the exception of the two units at Salem, which are operated by PSEG Nuclear, LLC (PSEG Nuclear), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of PSEG. In 2020, 2019, and 2018 electric supply (in GWh) generated from the nuclear generating facilities was 62%, 64%, and 68%, respectively, of Generation\u2019s total electric supply, which also includes fossil, hydroelectric, and renewable generation and electric supply purchased for resale. Generation\u2019s wholesale and retail power marketing activities are, in part, supplied by the output from the nuclear generating stations. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for additional information of Generation\u2019s electric supply sources.\nNuclear Operations\nCapacity factors, which are significantly affected by the number and duration of refueling and non-refueling outages, can have a significant impact on Generation\u2019s results of operations. Generation\u2019s operations from its nuclear plants have historically had minimal environmental impact and the plants have a safe operating history.\nGeneration manages its scheduled refueling outages to minimize their duration and to maintain high nuclear generating capacity factors, resulting in a stable generation base for Generation\u2019s wholesale and retail power marketing activities. During scheduled refueling outages, Generation performs maintenance and equipment upgrades in order to minimize the occurrence of unplanned outages and to maintain safe, reliable operations. During 2020, 2019, and 2018, the nuclear generating facilities operated by Generation, achieved capacity factors of 95.4%, 95.7%, and 94.6%, respectively, at ownership percentage.\nIn addition to the maintenance and equipment upgrades performed by Generation during scheduled refueling outages, Generation has extensive operating and security procedures in place to ensure the safe operation of the nuclear units. Generation also has extensive safety systems in place to protect the plant, personnel, and surrounding area in the unlikely event of an accident or other incident.\nRegulation of Nuclear Power Generation\nGeneration is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC with respect to the operation of its nuclear generating stations, including the licensing for operation of each unit. The NRC subjects nuclear generating stations to continuing review and regulation covering, among other things, operations, maintenance, emergency planning, security, and environmental and radiological aspects of those stations. As part of its reactor oversight process, the NRC continuously assesses unit performance indicators and inspection results and communicates its assessment on a semi-annual basis. All nuclear generating stations operated by Generation are categorized by the NRC in the Licensee Response Column, which is the highest of five performance bands. The NRC may modify, suspend, or revoke operating licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act or the terms of the operating licenses. Changes in regulations by the NRC may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures and/or operating costs for nuclear generating facilities.\nLicenses\nGeneration has original 40-year operating licenses from the NRC for each of its nuclear units and has received 20-year operating license renewals from the NRC for all its nuclear units except Clinton. PSEG has received 20-year operating license renewals for Salem Units 1 and 2. Peach Bottom has received a second 20-year license\nrenewal from the NRC for Units 2 and 3. On August 27, 2020, Generation announced that it intends to permanently cease generation operations at Byron in September 2021 and at Dresden in November 2021. See Note 7 - Early Plant Retirements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe following table summarizes the current license expiration dates for Generation\u2019s operating nuclear facilities in service:\n__________\n(a)Denotes year in which nuclear unit began commercial operations.\n(b)Although timing has been delayed, Generation currently plans to seek license renewal for Clinton and has notified the NRC that any license renewal application would not be filed until the first quarter of 2024. In 2019, the NRC approved a change of the operating license expiration for Clinton from 2026 to 2027.\nThe operating license renewal process takes approximately four to five years from the commencement of the renewal process, which includes approximately two years for Generation to develop the application and approximately two years for the NRC to review the application. Depreciation provisions are based on the estimated useful lives of the stations, which reflect the first renewal of the operating licenses for all of Generation\u2019s operating nuclear generating stations except for Clinton, Peach Bottom, Byron, and Dresden. Clinton depreciation provisions are based on an estimated useful life of 2027 which is the last year of the Illinois ZES. Peach Bottom depreciation provisions are based on estimated useful life of 2053 and 2054 for Unit 2 and Unit 3, respectively, which reflects the second renewal of its operating licenses. Byron and Dresden depreciation provisions are based on the announced shutdown dates of September 2021 and November 2021, respectively. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Illinois ZES and Note 7 - Early Plant Retirements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on early retirements.\nNuclear Waste Storage and Disposal\nThere are no facilities for the reprocessing or permanent disposal of SNF currently in operation in the United States, nor has the NRC licensed any such facilities. Generation currently stores all SNF generated by its nuclear generating facilities on-site in storage pools or in dry cask storage facilities. Since Generation\u2019s SNF storage pools generally do not have sufficient storage capacity for the life of the respective plant, Generation has developed dry cask storage facilities to support operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Generation had approximately 87,100 SNF assemblies (21,600 tons) stored on site in SNF pools or dry cask storage which includes SNF assemblies at Zion Station, for which Generation retains ownership even though the responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station has been assumed by another party, and TMI, which is no longer operational. See the Decommissioning section below for additional information regarding Zion Station. All currently operating Generation-owned nuclear sites have on-site dry cask storage. TMI's on-site dry cask storage is projected to be in operation in 2021. On-site dry cask storage in concert with on-site storage pools will be capable of meeting all current and future SNF storage requirements at Generation\u2019s sites through the end of the license renewal periods and through decommissioning.\nFor a discussion of matters associated with Generation\u2019s contracts with the DOE for the disposal of SNF, see Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs a by-product of their operations, nuclear generating units produce LLRW. LLRW is accumulated at each generating station and permanently disposed of at licensed disposal facilities. The Federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 provides that states may enter into agreements to provide regional disposal facilities for LLRW and restrict use of those facilities to waste generated within the region. Illinois and Kentucky have entered into such an agreement, although neither state currently has an operational site and none is anticipated to be operational for the next ten years.\nGeneration ships its Class A LLRW, which represents 93% of LLRW generated at its stations, to disposal facilities in Utah and South Carolina, which have enough storage capacity to store all Class A LLRW for the life of all stations in Generation's nuclear fleet. The disposal facility in South Carolina at present is only receiving LLRW from LLRW generators in South Carolina, New Jersey (which includes Salem), and Connecticut.\nGeneration utilizes on-site storage capacity at all its stations to store and stage for shipping Class B and Class C LLRW. Generation has a contract through 2032 to ship Class B and Class C LLRW to a disposal facility in Texas. The agreement provides for disposal of all current Class B and Class C LLRW currently stored at each station as well as the Class B and Class C LLRW generated during the term of the agreement. However, because the production of LLRW from Generation\u2019s nuclear fleet will exceed the capacity at the Texas site (3.9 million curies for 15 years beginning in 2012), Generation will still be required to utilize on-site storage at its stations for Class B and Class C LLRW. Generation currently has enough storage capacity to store all Class B and Class C LLRW for the life of all stations in Generation\u2019s nuclear fleet. Generation continues to pursue alternative disposal strategies for LLRW, including an LLRW reduction program to minimize on-site storage and cost impacts.\nNuclear Insurance\nGeneration is subject to liability, property damage, and other risks associated with major incidents at all of its nuclear stations. Generation has reduced its financial exposure to these risks through insurance and other industry risk-sharing provisions. See \u201cNuclear Insurance\u201d within Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFor information regarding property insurance, see ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - Generation. Generation is self-insured to the extent that any losses may exceed the amount of insurance maintained or are within the policy deductible for its insured losses. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s future financial statements.\nDecommissioning\nNRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in specified minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility. The ultimate decommissioning obligation will be funded by the NDT funds. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS - Exelon Corporation, Liquidity and Capital Resources; ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Nuclear Decommissioning, Asset Retirement Obligations, and Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund Investments; and Note 3 - Regulatory Matters, Note 2 - Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions, Note 18 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities, and Note 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Generation\u2019s NDT funds and its decommissioning obligations.\nOyster Creek Decommissioning. On July 1, 2019, Generation completed the sale with Holtec and its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Oyster Creek Environmental Protection, LLC (OCEP), of Oyster Creek under which Holtec has assumed the responsibility for decommissioning. See Note 2 - Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nZion Station Decommissioning. On September 1, 2010, Generation completed an ASA with EnergySolutions, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, EnergySolutions, LLC and ZionSolutions under which ZionSolutions has assumed responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station. See Note 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFossil and Renewable Facilities (including Hydroelectric)\nGeneration wholly owns all of its fossil and renewable generating stations, with the exception of: (1) Wyman; (2) certain wind project entities and a biomass project entity with minority interest owners; and (3) EGRP which is owned 49% by another owner. See Note 23 - Variable Interest Entities of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding EGRP which is a VIE. Generation\u2019s fossil and renewable generating stations are all operated by Generation, with the exception of Wyman, which is operated by a third party. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, electric supply (in GWh) generated from owned fossil and renewable generating facilities was 9%, 11%, and 11%, respectively, of Generation\u2019s total electric supply. The majority of this output was dispatched to support Generation\u2019s wholesale and retail power marketing activities. On December 8, 2020, Generation entered into an agreement to sell a significant portion of Generation's solar business. See ITEM 2. PROPERTIES for additional information regarding Generation's electric generating facilities and Note 2 - Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the sale of Generation's solar business.\nLicenses\nFossil and renewable generation plants are generally not licensed, and, therefore, the decision on when to retire plants is, fundamentally, a commercial one. FERC has the exclusive authority to license most non-Federal hydropower projects located on navigable waterways or Federal lands, or connected to the interstate electric grid, which include Generation's Conowingo Hydroelectric Project (Conowingo) and Muddy Run Pumped Storage Facility Project (Muddy Run). Muddy Run's license expires on December 1, 2055. On August 29, 2012, Generation submitted a hydroelectric license application to the FERC for a new license for Conowingo. Based on the FERC procedural schedule, the FERC licensing process for Conowingo was not completed prior to the expiration of the plant\u2019s license on September 1, 2014. As a result, on September 10, 2014, FERC issued an annual license for Conowingo, effective as of the expiration of the previous license. The annual license renews automatically absent any further FERC action. The stations are currently being depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which include actual and anticipated license renewal periods. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Conowingo.\nInsurance\nGeneration maintains business interruption insurance for its renewable projects, but not for its fossil and hydroelectric operations unless required by contract or financing agreements. See Note 17 - Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on financing agreements. Generation maintains both property damage and liability insurance. For property damage and liability claims for these operations, Generation is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s future financial conditions and their results of operations and cash flows. For information regarding property insurance, see ITEM 2. PROPERTIES - Generation.\nContracted Generation\nIn addition to energy produced by owned generation assets, Generation sources electricity from plants it does not own under long-term contracts. The following tables summarize Generation\u2019s long-term contracts to purchase unit-specific physical power with an original term in excess of one year in duration, by region, in effect as of December 31, 2020:\nFuel\nThe following table shows sources of electric supply in GWh for 2020 and 2019:\n__________\n(a)Includes the proportionate share of output where Generation has an undivided ownership interest in jointly-owned generating plants and includes the total output of plants that are fully consolidated (e.g., CENG). Nuclear generation for 2020 and 2019 includes physical volumes of 35,052 GWh and 35,745 GWh, respectively, for CENG.\n(b)Includes wind, hydroelectric, solar, and biomass generating assets.\nThe cycle of production and utilization of nuclear fuel includes the mining and milling of uranium ore into uranium concentrates, the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, the enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride, and the fabrication of fuel assemblies. Generation has inventory in various forms and does not anticipate difficulty in obtaining the necessary uranium concentrates or conversion, enrichment, or fabrication services to meet the nuclear fuel requirements of its nuclear units.\nNatural gas is procured through long-term and short-term contracts, as well as spot-market purchases. Fuel oil inventories are managed so that in the winter months sufficient volumes of fuel are available in the event of extreme weather conditions and during the remaining months to take advantage of favorable market pricing.\nGeneration uses financial instruments to mitigate price risk associated with certain commodity price exposures, using both over-the-counter and exchange-traded instruments. See",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nEach of the Registrants operates in a complex market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond that Registrant\u2019s direct control. Such risks, which could negatively affect one or more of the Registrants\u2019 consolidated financial statements, fall primarily under the categories below:\nMarket and Financial Factors primarily include:\n\u2022the price of fuels, in particular the price of natural gas, which affects power prices,\n\u2022the generation resources in the markets in which the Registrants operate,\n\u2022the demand for electricity, reliability of service, and affordability in the markets where the Registrants conduct their business,\n\u2022the ability of the Registrants to operate their respective generating and transmission and distribution assets, their ability to access capital markets, and the impacts on their results of operations due to the global outbreak (pandemic) of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19),\n\u2022the impacts of on-going competition, and\n\u2022emerging technologies and business models, including those related to climate change mitigation and transition to a low carbon economy.\nRegulatory, Legislative, and Legal Factors primarily include changes to, and compliance with, the laws and regulations that govern:\n\u2022the design of power markets,\n\u2022ZEC programs,\n\u2022utility regulatory business models,\n\u2022environmental and climate policy, and\n\u2022tax policy.\nOperational Factors primarily include:\n\u2022changes in the global climate could produce extreme weather events, which could put the Registrant\u2019s facilities at risk, and such changes could also affect the levels and patterns of demand for energy and related services,\n\u2022the safe, secure, and effective operation of Generation\u2019s nuclear facilities and the ability to effectively manage the associated decommissioning obligations,\n\u2022the ability of the Registrants to maintain the reliability, resiliency, and safety of their energy delivery systems, which could affect the operating costs of the Registrants and the opinions of their customers and regulators, and\n\u2022physical and cyber security risks for the Registrants as the owner-operators of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading.\nRisks Related to the Planned Separation primarily include:\n\u2022the timing and conditions associated with required regulatory approvals, which may affect the costs to achieve the separation and its timing,\n\u2022challenges to achieving the benefits of separation, including maintaining investment grade credit ratings, and\n\u2022the risk that the separation could be treated as a taxable transaction to both Exelon and its shareholders.\nThere may be further risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed by the Registrants to be material that could negatively affect its consolidated financial statements in the future.\nMarket and Financial Factors\nGeneration is exposed to price volatility associated with both the wholesale and retail power markets and the procurement of nuclear and fossil fuel (Exelon and Generation).\nGeneration is exposed to commodity price risk for the unhedged portion of its electricity generation supply portfolio. Generation\u2019s earnings and cash flows are therefore exposed to variability of spot and forward market prices in the markets in which it operates.\nPrice of Fuels. The spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the marginal cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour. Thus, the market price of power is affected by the market price of the marginal fuel used to generate the electricity unit.\nDemand and Supply. The market price for electricity is also affected by changes in the demand for electricity and the available supply of electricity. Unfavorable economic conditions, milder than normal weather, and the growth of energy efficiency and demand response programs could each depress demand. In addition, in some markets, the supply of electricity could often exceed demand during some hours of the day, resulting in loss of revenue for base-load generating plants such as Generation's nuclear plants. Conversely, new demand sources such as electrification of transportation could increase demand and change demand patterns.\nRetail Competition. Generation\u2019s retail operations compete for customers in a competitive environment, which affects the margins that Generation can earn and the volumes that it is able to serve. In periods of sustained low natural gas and power prices and low market volatility, retail competitors can aggressively pursue market share because the barriers to entry can be low and wholesale generators (including Generation) use their retail operations to hedge generation output.\nThe impact of sustained low market prices or depressed demand and over-supply could be emphasized given Generation\u2019s concentration of base-load electric generating capacity within primarily two geographic market regions, namely the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic. These impacts could adversely affect Generation\u2019s ability to fund regulated utility growth for the benefit of customers, reduce debt and provide attractive shareholder returns. In addition, such conditions may no longer support the continued operation of certain generating facilities, which could adversely affect Generation's financial statements primarily through accelerated depreciation and amortization expenses and one-time charges. See Note 7 - Early Plant Retirements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCost of Fuel. Generation depends on nuclear fuel and fossil fuels to operate most of its generating facilities. The supply markets for nuclear fuel, natural gas, and oil are subject to price fluctuations, availability restrictions, and counterparty default.\nMarket Designs. The wholesale markets vary from region to region with distinct rules, practices, and procedures. Changes in these market rules, problems with rule implementation, or failure of any of these markets could adversely affect Generation\u2019s business. In addition, a significant decrease in market participation could affect market liquidity and have a detrimental effect on market stability.\nThe Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry (All Registrants).\nSome of these technologies include, but are not limited to, further development or applications of technologies related to shale gas production, renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency, distributed generation, and energy storage devices. Such developments could affect the price of energy, levels of customer-owned generation, customer expectations, and current business models and make portions of our electric system power supply and transmission and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives. Such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy. Each of these factors could affect the Registrants\u2019 consolidated financial statements through, among other things, reduced operating revenues, increased operating and maintenance expenses, increased capital expenditures, and potential asset impairment charges or accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expenses over shortened remaining asset useful lives.\nMarket performance and other factors could decrease the value of NDT funds and employee benefit plan assets and could increase the related employee benefit plan obligations, which then could require significant additional funding (All Registrants).\nDisruptions in the capital markets and their actual or perceived effects on particular businesses and the greater economy could adversely affect the value of the investments held within Generation\u2019s NDTs and Exelon\u2019s employee benefit plan trusts. The Registrants have significant obligations in these areas and Exelon and Generation hold substantial assets in these trusts to meet those obligations. The asset values are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below the Registrants\u2019 projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the NDT fund investments could increase Generation\u2019s funding requirements to\ndecommission its nuclear plants. A decline in the market value of the pension and OPEB plan assets would increase the funding requirements associated with Exelon\u2019s pension and OPEB plan obligations. Additionally, Exelon\u2019s pension and OPEB plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit costs and funding requirements. Changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions or changes to Social Security or Medicare eligibility requirements could also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and OPEB plans. See Note 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations and Note 15 - Retirement Benefits of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by unstable capital and credit markets and increased volatility in commodity markets (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as the banking and commercial paper markets, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets in the United States or abroad could negatively affect the Registrants\u2019 ability to access the capital markets or draw on their respective bank revolving credit facilities. The banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to the Registrants if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. The inability to access capital markets or credit facilities, and longer-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could result in the deferral of discretionary capital expenditures, Generation\u2019s ability to hedge effectively its generation portfolio, changes to Generation\u2019s hedging strategy in order to reduce collateral posting requirements, or a reduction in dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash. In addition, the Registrants have exposure to worldwide financial markets, including Europe, Canada, and Asia. Disruptions in these markets could reduce or restrict the Registrants\u2019 ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 23%, 19%, and 18% of the Registrants\u2019 available credit facilities were with European, Canadian, and Asian banks, respectively. See Note 17 - Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the credit facilities.\nThe strength and depth of competition in energy markets depend heavily on active participation by multiple trading parties, which could be negatively affected by disruptions in the capital and credit markets and legislative and regulatory initiatives that could affect participants in commodities transactions. Reduced capital and liquidity and failures of significant institutions that participate in the energy markets could diminish the liquidity and competitiveness of energy markets that are important to the respective businesses of the Registrants. Perceived weaknesses in the competitive strength of the energy markets could lead to pressures for greater regulation of those markets or attempts to replace market structures with other mechanisms for the sale of power, including the requirement of long-term contracts.\nIf any of the Registrants were to experience a downgrade in its credit ratings to below investment grade or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards in its agreements with its counterparties, it would be required to provide significant amounts of collateral under its agreements with counterparties and could experience higher borrowing costs (All Registrants).\nGeneration\u2019s business is subject to credit quality standards that could require market participants to post collateral for their obligations. If Generation were to be downgraded or lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating) or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards of trading counterparties, it would be required under its hedging arrangements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which could have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity. The amount of collateral required to be provided by Generation at any point in time depends on a variety of factors, including (1) the notional amount of the applicable hedge, (2) the nature of counterparty and related agreements, and (3) changes in power or other commodity prices. In addition, if Generation were downgraded, it could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade. Changes in ratings methodologies by the credit rating agencies could also have a negative impact on the ratings of Generation.\nGeneration has project-specific financing arrangements and must meet the requirements of various agreements relating to those financings. Failure to meet those arrangements could give rise to a project-specific financing default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the specific project being required to repay the associated\ndebt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated, and if such repayment were not made, the lenders or security holders would generally have broad remedies, including rights to foreclose against the project assets and related collateral or to force the Exelon subsidiaries in the project-specific financings to enter into bankruptcy proceedings. The impact of bankruptcy could result in the impairment of certain project assets.\nThe Utility Registrants' operating agreements with PJM and PECO's, BGE's, and DPL's natural gas procurement contracts contain collateral provisions that are affected by their credit rating and market prices. If certain wholesale market conditions were to exist and the Utility Registrants were to lose their investment grade credit ratings (based on their senior unsecured debt ratings), they would be required to provide collateral in the forms of letters of credit or cash, which could have a material adverse effect upon their remaining sources of liquidity. PJM collateral posting requirements will generally increase as market prices rise and decrease as market prices fall. Collateral posting requirements for PECO, BGE, and DPL, with respect to their natural gas supply contracts, will generally increase as forward market prices fall and decrease as forward market prices rise. If the Utility Registrants were downgraded, they could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade. In addition, changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have an adverse negative impact on the ratings of the Utility Registrants.\nThe Utility Registrants conduct their respective businesses and operate under governance models and other arrangements and procedures intended to assure that the Utility Registrants are treated as separate, independent companies, distinct from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in order to isolate the Utility Registrants from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in the event of financial difficulty at Exelon or another Exelon subsidiary. These measures (commonly referred to as \u201cring-fencing\u201d) could help avoid or limit a downgrade in the credit ratings of the Utility Registrants in the event of a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon. Despite these ring-fencing measures, the credit ratings of the Utility Registrants could remain linked, to some degree, to the credit ratings of Exelon. Consequently, a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon could result in a reduction of the credit rating of some or all of the Utility Registrants. A reduction in the credit rating of a Utility Registrant could have a material adverse effect on the Utility Registrant.\nSee ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Matters - Market Conditions and Security Ratings for additional information regarding the potential impacts of credit downgrades on the Registrants\u2019 cash flows.\nGeneration\u2019s risk management policies cannot fully eliminate the risk associated with its commodity trading activities (Exelon and Generation).\nGeneration\u2019s asset-based power position as well as its power marketing, fuel procurement, and other commodity trading activities expose Generation to risks of commodity price movements. Generation buys and sells energy and other products and enters into financial contracts to manage risk and hedge various positions in Generation\u2019s power generation portfolio. Generation is exposed to volatility in financial results for unhedged positions as well as the risk of ineffective hedges. Generation attempts to manage this exposure through enforcement of established risk limits and risk management procedures. These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities. Even when its policies and procedures are followed, and decisions are made based on projections and estimates of future performance, results of operations could be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those decisions prove to be incorrect. Factors, such as future prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities, become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future estimates are made. As a result, Generation cannot predict the impact that its commodity trading activities and risk management decisions could have on its consolidated financial statements.\nFinancial performance and load requirements could be negatively affected if Generation is unable to effectively manage its power portfolio (Exelon and Generation).\nA significant portion of Generation\u2019s power portfolio is used to provide power under procurement contracts with the Utility Registrants and other customers. To the extent portions of the power portfolio are not needed for that purpose, Generation\u2019s output is sold in the wholesale power markets. To the extent its power portfolio is not sufficient to meet the requirements of its customers under the related agreements, Generation must purchase power in the wholesale power markets. Generation\u2019s financial results could be negatively affected if it is unable to cost-effectively meet the load requirements of its customers, manage its power portfolio or effectively address the changes in the wholesale power markets.\nThe impacts of significant economic downturns or increases in customer rates, could lead to decreased volumes delivered and increased expense for uncollectible customer balances (All Registrants).\nThe impacts of significant economic downturns on the Utility Registrants' customers, such as less demand for products and services provided by commercial and industrial customers, and the related regulatory limitations on residential service terminations, could result in an increase in the number of uncollectible customer balances. Further, increases in customer rates, including those related to increases in purchased power and natural gas prices, could result in declines in customer usage and lower revenues for the Utility Registrants that do not have decoupling mechanisms.\nGeneration's customer-facing energy delivery activities face similar economic downturn risks, such as lower volumes sold and increased expense for uncollectible customer balances.\nSee ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK for additional information of the Registrants\u2019 credit risk.\nThe Registrants' results could be negatively affected by the impacts of COVID-19 (All Registrants).\nCOVID-19 is an evolving situation that could lead to extended disruption of economic activity in the Registrants\u2019 respective markets. COVID-19 could negatively affect the Registrants\u2019 ability to operate their respective generating and transmission and distribution assets, their ability to access capital markets, and their results of operations. The Registrants cannot predict the extent of the impacts of COVID-19, which will depend on future developments and which are highly uncertain. See Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Executive Overview for additional information.\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by the impacts of weather (All Registrants).\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities. Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. Moderate temperatures adversely affect the usage of energy and resulting revenues at PECO, DPL Delaware, and ACE. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE, Pepco, and DPL Maryland recognize revenues at MDPSC and DCPSC-approved levels per customer, regardless of what actual distribution volumes are for a billing period and are not affected by actual weather with the exception of major storms. ComEd\u2019s customer rates are adjusted to eliminate the favorable and unfavorable impacts of weather and customer usage patterns on distribution revenue.\nExtreme weather conditions or damage resulting from storms could stress the Utility Registrants' transmission and distribution systems, communication systems, and technology, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs and limiting each company\u2019s ability to meet peak customer demand. First and third quarter financial results, in particular, are substantially dependent on weather conditions, and could make period comparisons less relevant.\nGeneration\u2019s operations are also affected by weather, which affects demand for electricity as well as operating conditions. To the extent that weather is warmer in the summer or colder in the winter than assumed, Generation could require greater resources to meet its contractual commitments. Extreme weather conditions or storms could affect the availability of generation and its transmission, limiting Generation\u2019s ability to source or send power to where it is sold. In addition, drought-like conditions limiting water usage could impact Generation\u2019s ability to run certain generating assets at full capacity. These conditions, which cannot be accurately predicted, could cause Generation to seek additional capacity at a time when wholesale markets are tight or to seek to sell excess capacity at a time when markets are weak.\nClimate change projections suggest increases to summer temperature and humidity trends, as well as more erratic precipitation and storm patterns over the long-term in the areas where Registrants have generation, transmission, and distribution assets. The frequency in which weather conditions emerge outside the current expected climate norms could contribute to weather-related impacts discussed above.\nLong-lived assets, goodwill, and other assets could become impaired (All Registrants).\nLong-lived assets represent the single largest asset class on the Registrants\u2019 statements of financial position. In addition, Exelon, ComEd, and PHI have material goodwill balances.\nThe Registrants evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or circumstances indicating a potential impairment exist. Factors such as, but not limited to, the business climate, including current and future energy and market conditions, environmental regulation, and the condition of assets are considered.\nComEd and PHI perform an assessment for possible impairment of their goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying amount. Regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions, including discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd\u2019s, Pepco\u2019s, DPL\u2019s, and ACE\u2019s business, and the fair value of debt, could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon\u2019s, ComEd's, and PHI\u2019s goodwill.\nAn impairment would require the Registrants to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset or goodwill to fair value through a non-cash charge to expense by the amount of the impairment. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Note 8 - Property, Plant, and Equipment, Note 12 - Asset Impairments and Note 13 - Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on long-lived asset impairments and goodwill impairments.\nThe Registrants could incur substantial costs in the event of non-performance by third-parties under indemnification agreements, or when the Registrants have guaranteed their performance. Generation is exposed to other credit risks in the power markets that are beyond its control (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants have entered into various agreements with counterparties that require those counterparties to reimburse a Registrant and hold it harmless against specified obligations and claims. To the extent that any of these counterparties are affected by deterioration in their creditworthiness or the agreements are otherwise determined to be unenforceable, the affected Registrant could be held responsible for the obligations. Each of the Utility Registrants has transferred its former generation business to a third party and in each case the transferee has agreed to assume certain obligations and to indemnify the applicable Utility Registrant for such obligations. In connection with the restructurings under which ComEd, PECO, and BGE transferred their generating assets to Generation, Generation assumed certain of ComEd\u2019s, PECO\u2019s, and BGE's rights and obligations with respect to their former generation businesses. Further, ComEd, PECO, and BGE have entered into agreements with third parties under which the third-party agreed to indemnify ComEd, PECO, or BGE for certain obligations related to their respective former generation businesses that have been assumed by Generation as part of the restructuring. If the third-party, Generation, or the transferee of Pepco's, DPL's, or ACE\u2019s generation facilities experienced events that reduced its creditworthiness or the indemnity arrangement became unenforceable, the applicable Utility Registrant could be liable for any existing or future claims. In addition, the Utility Registrants have residual liability under certain laws in connection with their former generation facilities.\nThe Registrants have issued indemnities to third parties regarding environmental or other matters in connection with purchases and sales of assets and they could incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations under these indemnities.\nThe Registrants have issued guarantees of the performance of third parties, which obligate the Registrants to perform in the event that the third parties do not perform. In the event of non-performance by those third parties, the Registrants could incur substantial cost to fulfill their obligations under these guarantees.\nIn the bilateral markets, Generation is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Generation money or are obligated to purchase energy or fuel from Generation, will not perform under their obligations for operational or financial reasons. In the event the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Generation could be forced to purchase or sell energy or fuel in the wholesale markets at less favorable prices and incur additional losses, to the extent amounts, if any, were already paid to the counterparties. In the spot markets, Generation is\nexposed to risk as a result of default sharing mechanisms that exist within certain markets, primarily RTOs and ISOs. Generation is also a party to agreements with entities in the energy sector that have experienced rating downgrades or other financial difficulties. In addition, Generation\u2019s retail sales subject it to credit risk through competitive electricity and natural gas supply activities to serve commercial and industrial companies, governmental entities and residential customers. Retail credit risk results when customers default on their contractual obligations. This risk represents the loss that could be incurred due to the nonpayment of a customer\u2019s account balance, as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve the customer.\nRegulatory, Legislative, and Legal Factors\nFederal or state legislative or regulatory actions could negatively affect the scope and functioning of the wholesale markets (Exelon and Generation).\nApproximately 70% of Generation\u2019s generating resources, which include directly owned assets and capacity obtained through long-term contracts, are located in the area encompassed by PJM. Generation\u2019s future results of operations are impacted by (1) FERC\u2019s and PJM's support for policies that favor the preservation of competitive wholesale power markets and recognize the value of zero-carbon electricity and resiliency and for states' energy objectives and policies (2) the absence of material changes to market structures that would limit or otherwise negatively affect Exelon or Generation. Generation could also be affected by state laws, regulations, or initiatives to subsidize existing or new generation.\nFERC\u2019s requirements for market-based rate authority could pose a risk that Generation may no longer satisfy FERC\u2019s tests for market-based rates.\nThe Registrants\u2019 are highly regulated and could be negatively affected by regulatory and legislative actions (All Registrants).\nSubstantially all aspects of the businesses of the Registrants are subject to comprehensive Federal or state regulation and legislation.\nGeneration\u2019s consolidated financial statements are significantly affected by its sales and purchases of commodities at market-based rates, as opposed to cost-based or other similarly regulated rates and Federal and state regulatory and legislative developments related to emissions, climate change, capacity market mitigation, energy price information, resilience, fuel diversity, and RPS. Legislative and regulatory efforts in Illinois, New York, and New Jersey to preserve the environmental attributes and reliability benefits of zero-emission nuclear-powered generating facilities through ZEC programs are or could be subject to legal and regulatory challenges and, if overturned, could result in the early retirement of certain of Generation\u2019s nuclear plants. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters and Note 7 - Early Plant Retirements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Utility Registrants' consolidated financial statements are heavily dependent on the ability of the Utility Registrants to recover their costs for the retail purchase and distribution of power and natural gas to their customers.\nFundamental changes in regulations or other adverse legislative actions affecting the Registrants\u2019 businesses would require changes in their business planning models and operations. The Registrants cannot predict when or whether legislative and regulatory proposals could become law or what their effect will be on the Registrants.\nChanges in the Utility Registrants' respective terms and conditions of service, including their respective rates, are subject to regulatory approval proceedings and/or negotiated settlements that are at times contentious, lengthy, and subject to appeal, which lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate result and which could introduce time delays in effectuating rate changes (Exelon and the Utility Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants are required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates for their respective services. These proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups, and various consumers of\nenergy, who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. Decisions are subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with the approval proceedings. The potential duration of such proceedings creates a risk that rates ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient for a Utility Registrant to recover its costs by the time the rates become effective. Established rates are also subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators, whereby various portions of rates could be adjusted, subject to refund or disallowed, including recovery mechanisms for costs associated with the procurement of electricity or gas, credit losses, MGP remediation, smart grid infrastructure, and energy efficiency and demand response programs. In certain instances, the Utility Registrants could agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters, customer initiatives, or franchise agreements. These settlements are subject to regulatory approval. The ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings have a significant effect on the ability of the Utility Registrants to recover their costs or earn an adequate return. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNRC actions could negatively affect the operations and profitability of Generation\u2019s nuclear generating fleet (Exelon and Generation).\nRegulatory risk. A change in the Atomic Energy Act or the applicable regulations or licenses could require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or could result in increased operating or decommissioning costs. Events at nuclear plants owned by others, as well as those owned by Generation, could cause the NRC to initiate such actions.\nSpent nuclear fuel storage. The approval of a national repository for the storage of SNF and the timing of such a facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with storage of SNF and the ultimate amounts received from the DOE to reimburse Generation for these costs.\nAny regulatory action relating to the timing and availability of a repository for SNF could adversely affect Generation\u2019s ability to fully decommission its nuclear units. Generation cannot predict what, if any, fee may be established in the future for SNF disposal. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the SNF obligation.\nThe Registrants could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards, including the likely exposure of the Utility Registrants to the results of PJM\u2019s RTEP and NERC compliance requirements (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants as users, owners, and operators of the bulk power transmission system, including Generation and the Utility Registrants, are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by NERC and enforced by FERC. PECO, BGE, and DPL, as operators of natural gas distribution systems, are also subject to mandatory reliability standards of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with or changes in the reliability standards could subject the Registrants to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. In addition, the ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DPSC, and NJBPU impose certain distribution reliability standards on the Utility Registrants. If the Registrants were found not to be in compliance with the Federal and state mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to remediation costs as well as sanctions, which could include substantial monetary penalties.\nThe Registrants could incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters (All Registrants).\nThe businesses that the Registrants operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation and legislation by local, state, and Federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Registrants conduct their operations and make capital expenditures including how they handle air and water emissions, hazardous and solid waste, and activities affecting surface waters, groundwater, and aquatic and other species. Violations of these requirements could subject the Registrants to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs for remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties and exposure to third parties\u2019 claims for alleged health or property damages, or operating restrictions to achieve compliance. In addition, the Registrants are subject to liability under these laws for the remediation costs for environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by the Registrants and of property\ncontaminated by hazardous substances they generated or released. Remediation activities associated with MGP operations conducted by predecessor companies are one component of such costs. Also, the Registrants are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and could be subject to additional proceedings in the future. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS - Environmental Regulation for additional information.\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by challenges to tax positions taken, tax law changes, and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions. (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants are required to make judgments in order to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeal issues related to these tax matters. These judgments include reserves established for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken that could be subject to challenge by the tax authorities. See Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies and Note 14 - Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by federal and state RPS and/or energy conservation legislation, along with energy conservation by customers (All Registrants).\nChanges to current state legislation or the development of Federal legislation that requires the use of clean, renewable, and alternate fuel sources could significantly impact Generation and the Utility Registrants, especially if timely cost recovery is not allowed for Utility Registrants. The impact could include increased costs and increased rates for customers.\nFederal and state legislation mandating the implementation of energy conservation programs that require the implementation of new technologies, such as smart meters and smart grid, could increase capital expenditures and could significantly impact the Utility Registrants consolidated financial statements if timely cost recovery is not allowed. Furthermore, regulated energy consumption reduction targets and declines in customer energy consumption resulting from the implementation of new energy conservation technologies could lead to a decline in the revenues of the Registrants. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS - Environmental Regulation - Renewable and Clean Energy Standards for additional information.\nGeneration\u2019s affiliation with the Utility Registrants, together with the presence of a substantial percentage of Generation\u2019s physical asset base within the Utility Registrants' service territories, could increase Generation\u2019s cost of doing business to the extent future complaints or challenges regarding the Utility Registrants' retail rates result in settlements or legislative or regulatory requirements funded in part by Generation (Exelon and Generation).\nGeneration has significant generating resources within the service areas of the Utility Registrants and makes significant sales to each of them. Those facts tend to cause Generation to be directly affected by developments in those markets. Government officials, legislators, and advocacy groups are aware of Generation\u2019s affiliation with the Utility Registrants and its sales to each of them. In periods of rising utility rates, particularly when driven by increased costs of energy production and supply, those officials and advocacy groups could question or challenge costs and transactions incurred by the Utility Registrants with Generation, irrespective of any previous regulatory processes or approvals underlying those transactions. These challenges could increase the time, complexity, and cost of the associated regulatory proceedings, and the occurrence of such challenges could subject Generation to a level of scrutiny not faced by other unaffiliated competitors in those markets. In addition, government officials and legislators could seek ways to force Generation to contribute to efforts to mitigate potential or actual rate increases, through measures such as generation-based taxes.\nThe Registrants could be subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make them vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other consequences (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants could be the subject of public criticism. Adverse publicity of this nature could render public service commissions and other regulatory and legislative authorities less likely to view energy companies such as Exelon and its subsidiaries in a favorable light, and could cause Exelon and its subsidiaries to be susceptible\nto less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes, as well as increased regulatory oversight and more stringent legislative or regulatory requirements (e.g. disallowances of costs, lower ROEs).\nLegal proceedings could result in a negative outcome, which the Registrants cannot predict (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising out of their business operations. The material ones are summarized in Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures, result in lost revenue, or restrict existing business activities.\nExelon and ComEd have received requests for information related to an SEC investigation into their lobbying activities. The outcome of the investigations could have a material adverse effect on their reputation and consolidated financial statements (Exelon and ComEd).\nOn October 22, 2019, the SEC notified Exelon and ComEd that it had opened an investigation into their lobbying activities in the state of Illinois. Exelon and ComEd have cooperated fully, including by providing all information requested by the SEC, and intend to continue to cooperate fully and expeditiously with the SEC. The outcome of the SEC\u2019s investigation cannot be predicted and could subject Exelon and ComEd to civil penalties, sanctions, or other remedial measures. Any of the foregoing, as well as the appearance of non-compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, could have an adverse impact on Exelon\u2019s and ComEd\u2019s reputations or relationships with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers, and other stakeholders, as well as their consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf ComEd violates its Deferred Prosecution Agreement announced on July 17, 2020, it could have an adverse effect on the reputation and consolidated financial statements of Exelon and ComEd (Exelon and ComEd).\nOn July 17, 2020, ComEd entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Illinois (USAO) to resolve the USAO\u2019s investigation into Exelon\u2019s and ComEd\u2019s lobbying activities in the State of Illinois. Exelon was not made a party to the DPA and the investigation by the USAO into Exelon\u2019s activities ended with no charges being brought against Exelon. Under the DPA, the USAO filed a single charge alleging that ComEd improperly gave and offered to give jobs, vendor subcontracts, and payments associated with those jobs and subcontracts for the benefit of the Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives and the Speaker\u2019s associates, with the intent to influence the Speaker\u2019s action regarding legislation affecting ComEd\u2019s interests. The DPA provides that the USAO will defer any prosecution of such charge and any other criminal or civil case against ComEd in connection with the matters identified therein for a three-year period subject to certain obligations of ComEd, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) payment to the United States Treasury of $200 million; (ii) continued full cooperation with the government\u2019s investigation; and (iii) ComEd\u2019s adoption and maintenance of remedial measures involving compliance and reporting undertakings as specified in the DPA. If ComEd is found to have breached the terms of the DPA, the USAO may elect to prosecute, or bring a civil action against, ComEd for conduct alleged in the DPA or known to the government, which could result in fines or penalties and could have an adverse impact on Exelon\u2019s and ComEd\u2019s reputation or relationships with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers and other stakeholders, as well as their consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGeneration\u2019s financial performance could be negatively affected by risks arising from its ownership and operation of hydroelectric facilities (Exelon and Generation).\nFERC has the exclusive authority to license most non-Federal hydropower projects located on navigable waterways, Federal lands or connected to the interstate electric grid. Generation cannot predict whether it will receive all the regulatory approvals for the renewed licenses of its hydroelectric facilities. If FERC does not issue new operating licenses for Generation\u2019s hydroelectric facilities or a station cannot be operated through the end of its operating license, Generation\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by increased depreciation rates and accelerated future decommissioning costs, since depreciation rates and decommissioning cost estimates currently include assumptions that license renewal will be received. Generation could also lose\nrevenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments. In addition, conditions could be imposed as part of the license renewal process that could adversely affect operations, could require a substantial increase in capital expenditures, could result in increased operating costs or could render the project uneconomic. Similar effects could result from a change in the Federal Power Act or the applicable regulations due to events at hydroelectric facilities owned by others, as well as those owned by Generation.\nOperational Factors\nThe Registrants are subject to risks associated with climate change (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants periodically perform analyses to better understand how climate change could affect their facilities and operations. The Registrants primarily operate in the Midwest and East Coast of the United States, areas that historically have been prone to various types of severe weather events, such that the Registrants have well-developed response and recovery programs based on these historical events. However, the Registrants\u2019 physical facilities could be placed at greater risk of damage should changes in the global climate impact temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, unprecedented levels of precipitation, sea level rise, increased surface water temperatures, and/or other effects. In addition, changes to the climate may impact levels and patterns of demand for energy and related services, which could affect Registrants\u2019 operations. Over time, the Registrants may need to make additional investments to protect facilities from physical climate-related risks and/or adapt to changes in operational requirements as a result of climate change.\nThe Registrants also periodically perform analyses of potential pathways to reduce power sector and economy-wide GHG emissions to mitigate climate change. To the extent additional GHG reduction regulation or legislation becomes effective at the Federal and/or state levels, the Registrants could incur costs to further limit the GHG emissions from their operations or otherwise comply with applicable requirements. To the extent such additional regulation or legislation does not become effective, the potential competitive advantage offered by Registrant\u2019s low-carbon emission profile may be reduced. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS - Climate Change Mitigation.\nGeneration\u2019s financial performance could be negatively affected by matters arising from its ownership and operation of nuclear facilities (Exelon and Generation).\nNuclear capacity factors. Capacity factors for nuclear generating units, significantly affect Generation\u2019s results of operations. Lower capacity factors could decrease Generation\u2019s revenues and increase operating costs by requiring Generation to produce additional energy from primarily its fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy Generation\u2019s obligations to committed third-party sales, including the Utility Registrants. These sources generally have higher costs than Generation incurs to produce energy from its nuclear stations.\nNuclear refueling outages. In general, refueling outages are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months. The total number of refueling outages, along with their duration, could have a significant impact on Generation\u2019s results of operations. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or Generation experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease, and Generation faces lower margins due to higher energy replacement costs and/or lower energy sales and higher operating and maintenance costs.\nNuclear fuel quality. The quality of nuclear fuel utilized by Generation could affect the efficiency and costs of Generation\u2019s operations. Remediation actions could result in increased costs due to accelerated fuel amortization, increased outage costs, and/or increased costs due to decreased generation capabilities.\nOperational risk. Operations at any of Generation\u2019s nuclear generation plants could degrade to the point where Generation must shut down the plant or operate at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes could require significant time and expense. Generation could choose to close a plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the plant to full capacity. In either event, Generation could lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments.\nFor plants operated but not wholly owned by Generation, Generation could also incur liability to the co-owners. For nuclear plants not operated and not wholly owned by Generation, from which Generation receives a portion of the plants\u2019 output, Generation\u2019s results of operations are dependent on the operational performance of the operators and could be adversely affected by a significant event at those plants. Additionally, poor operating\nperformance at nuclear plants not owned by Generation could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear-fueled energy. In addition, closure of generating plants owned by others, or extended interruptions of generating plants, or failure of transmission lines, could affect transmission systems that could adversely affect the sale and delivery of electricity in markets served by Generation.\nNuclear major incident risk and insurance. The consequences of a major incident could be severe and include loss of life and property damage. Any resulting liability from a nuclear plant major incident within the United States, owned or operated by Generation or owned by others, could exceed Generation\u2019s resources, including insurance coverage. Generation is a member of an industry mutual insurance company, NEIL, which provides property and business interruption insurance for Generation\u2019s nuclear operations. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from insurers or the nuclear industry, could be borne by Generation. Additionally, an accident or other significant event at a nuclear plant within the United States or abroad, whether owned by Generation or others, could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear-fueled energy.\nAs required by the Price-Anderson Act, Generation carries the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance, $450 million for each operating site. Claims exceeding that amount are covered through mandatory participation in a financial protection pool. In addition, the U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims exceeding the $13.8 billion limit for a single incident.\nSee Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information of nuclear insurance.\nDecommissioning obligation and funding. NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in certain minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility.\nGeneration recognizes as a liability the present value of the estimated future costs to decommission its nuclear facilities. The estimated liability is based on assumptions in the approach and timing of decommissioning the nuclear facilities, estimation of decommissioning costs, and Federal and state regulatory requirements. The costs of such decommissioning may substantially exceed such liability, as facts, circumstances or our estimates may change, including changes in the approach and timing of decommissioning activities, changes in decommissioning costs, changes in Federal or state regulatory requirements on the decommissioning of such facilities, other changes in our estimates or Generation\u2019s ability to effectively execute on its planned decommissioning activities.\nGeneration makes contributions to certain trust funds of the former PECO units based on amounts being collected by PECO from its customers and remitted to Generation. While Generation, through PECO, has recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers (subject to certain limitations and thresholds), it has no recourse to collect additional amounts from utility customers for any of its other nuclear units if there is a shortfall of funds necessary for decommissioning. If circumstances changed such that Generation would be unable to continue to make contributions to the trust funds of the former PECO units based on amounts collected from PECO customers, or if Generation no longer had recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers if there was a shortfall of funds for decommissioning, the adequacy of the trust funds related to the former PECO units could be negatively affected.\nShould the expected value of the NDT fund for any former ComEd unit fall below the amount of the expected decommissioning obligation for that unit, the accounting to offset decommissioning-related activities in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income for that unit would be discontinued, the decommissioning-related activities would be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, and the adverse impact to Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s financial statements could be material. Any changes to the existing PECO regulatory agreements could impact Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s ability to offset decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income, and the impact to Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s financial statements could be material.\nForecasting trust fund investment earnings and costs to decommission nuclear generating stations requires significant judgment, and actual results could differ significantly from current estimates. If the investments held by Generation\u2019s NDT funds are not sufficient to fund the decommissioning of Generation\u2019s nuclear units, Generation could be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent\ncompany guarantees or making additional contributions to the trusts, which could be significant, to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded and that current and future NRC minimum funding requirements are met.\nSee Note 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Utility Registrants' operating costs are affected by their ability to maintain the availability and reliability of their delivery and operational systems (Exelon and the Utility Registrants).\nFailures of the equipment or facilities used in the Utility Registrants' delivery systems could interrupt the electric transmission and electric and natural gas delivery, which could result in a loss of revenues and an increase in maintenance and capital expenditures. Equipment or facilities failures can be due to a number of factors, including natural causes such as weather or information systems failure. Specifically, if the implementation of AMI, smart grid, or other technologies in the Utility Registrants' service territory fail to perform as intended or are not successfully integrated with billing and other information systems, or if any of the financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Utility Registrants' financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, dependence upon automated systems could further increase the risk that operational system flaws or internal and/or external tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.\nRegulated utilities, which are required to provide service to all customers within their service territory, have generally been afforded liability protections against claims by customers relating to failure of service. Under Illinois law, however, ComEd could be required to pay damages to its customers in some circumstances involving extended outages affecting large numbers of its customers, which could be material.\nThe Registrants are subject to physical security and cybersecurity risks (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants face physical security and cybersecurity risks. Threat sources continue to seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric and natural gas utility industry associated with protection of sensitive and confidential information, grid infrastructure, and other energy infrastructures, and such attacks and disruptions, both physical and cyber, are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dynamic. Continued implementation of advanced digital technologies increases the potentially unfavorable impacts of such attacks. A security breach of the physical assets or information systems of the Registrants, their competitors, vendors, business partners and interconnected entities in RTOs and ISOs, or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet and/or reliability of the transmission and distribution system or result in the theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including critical infrastructure information, sensitive customer, vendor, and employee data, trading or other confidential data. The risk of these system-related events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify, and while the Registrants have been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to physical and cyber-attacks, to date none has directly experienced a material breach or disruption to its network or information systems or our service operations. However, as such attacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency, the Registrants may be unable to prevent all such attacks in the future. If a significant breach were to occur, the reputation of the Registrants could be negatively affected, customer confidence in the Registrants or others in the industry could be diminished, or the Registrants could be subject to legal claims, loss of revenues, increased costs, or operations shutdown. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance maintained against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruptions to business that could result.\nThe Utility Registrants' deployment of smart meters throughout their service territories could increase the risk of damage from an intentional disruption of the system by third parties.\nIn addition, new or updated security regulations or unforeseen threat sources could require changes in current measures taken by the Registrants or their business operations and could adversely affect their consolidated financial statements.\nThe Registrants\u2019 employees, contractors, customers, and the general public could be exposed to a risk of injury due to the nature of the energy industry (All Registrants).\nEmployees and contractors throughout the organization work in, and customers and the general public could be exposed to, potentially dangerous environments near the Registrants\u2019 operations. As a result, employees,\ncontractors, customers, and the general public are at some risk for serious injury, including loss of life. These risks include nuclear accidents, dam failure, gas explosions, pole strikes, and electric contact cases.\nNatural disasters, war, acts and threats of terrorism, pandemic, and other significant events could negatively impact the Registrants' results of operations, their ability to raise capital and their future growth (All Registrants).\nGeneration\u2019s fleet of power plants and the Utility Registrants' distribution and transmission infrastructures could be affected by natural disasters and extreme weather events, which could result in increased costs, including supply chain costs. An extreme weather event within the Registrants\u2019 service areas can also directly affect their capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment. Natural disasters and other significant events increase the risk to Generation that the NRC or other regulatory or legislative bodies could change the laws or regulations governing, among other things, operations, maintenance, licensed lives, decommissioning, SNF storage, insurance, emergency planning, security, and environmental and radiological matters. In addition, natural disasters could affect the availability of a secure and economical supply of water in some locations, which is essential for Generation\u2019s continued operation, particularly the cooling of generating units.\nThe impact that potential terrorist attacks could have on the industry and on Exelon is uncertain. The Registrants face a risk that their operations would be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror. Any retaliatory military strikes or sustained military campaign could affect their operations in unpredictable ways, such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil. Furthermore, these catastrophic events could compromise the physical or cybersecurity of Exelon\u2019s facilities, which could adversely affect Exelon\u2019s ability to manage its business effectively. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, pandemic, credit crises, recession, or other factors also could result in a decline in energy consumption or interruption of fuel or the supply chain. In addition, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs.\nThe Registrants could be significantly affected by the outbreak of a pandemic. Exelon has plans in place to respond to a pandemic. However, depending on the severity of a pandemic and the resulting impacts to workforce and other resource availability, the ability to operate Exelon's generating and transmission and distribution assets could be affected.\nIn addition, Exelon maintains a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property, casualty and cybersecurity losses subject to unforeseen occurrences or catastrophic events that could damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations. However, there can be no assurance that the amount of insurance will be adequate to address such property and casualty losses.\nThe Registrants\u2019 businesses are capital intensive, and their assets could require significant expenditures to maintain and are subject to operational failure, which could result in potential liability (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants\u2019 businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments by Generation in electric generating facilities and by the Utility Registrants in transmission and distribution infrastructure projects. Equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good utility practices, is subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the Registrants\u2019 control, and could require significant expenditures to operate efficiently. The Registrants consolidated financial statements could be negatively affected if they were unable to effectively manage their capital projects or raise the necessary capital. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information regarding the Registrants\u2019 potential future capital expenditures.\nThe Utility Registrants' respective ability to deliver electricity, their operating costs, and their capital expenditures could be negatively impacted by transmission congestion and failures of neighboring transmission systems (Exelon and the Utility Registrants).\nDemand for electricity within the Utility Registrants' service areas could stress available transmission capacity requiring alternative routing or curtailment of electricity usage. Also, insufficient availability of electric supply to meet customer demand could jeopardize the Utility Registrants' ability to comply with reliability standards and strain customer and regulatory agency relationships. As with all utilities, potential concerns over transmission\ncapacity or generation facility retirements could result in PJM or FERC requiring the Utility Registrants to upgrade or expand their respective transmission systems through additional capital expenditures.\nPJM\u2019s systems and operations are designed to ensure the reliable operation of the transmission grid and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities. However, service interruptions at other utilities may cause interruptions in the Utility Registrants\u2019 service areas.\nThe Registrants consolidated financial statements could be negatively affected if they fail to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce (All Registrants).\nCertain events, such as an employee strike, loss of contract resources due to a major event, and an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, could lead to operating challenges and increased costs for the Registrants. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, could arise. The Registrants are particularly affected due to the specialized knowledge required of the technical and support employees for their generation, transmission, and distribution operations.\nThe Registrants could make acquisitions or investments in new business initiatives and new markets, which may not be successful or achieve the intended financial results (All Registrants).\nGeneration could continue to pursue growth in its existing businesses and markets and further diversification across the competitive energy value chain. This could include investment opportunities in renewables, development of natural gas generation, nuclear advisory or operating services for third parties, distributed generation, potential expansion of the existing wholesale gas businesses, and entry into LNG. Such initiatives could involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, inadequate return on capital, and unidentified issues not discovered during diligence performed prior to launching an initiative or entering a market. Additionally, it is possible that FERC, state public utility commissions or others could impose certain other restrictions on such transactions. All of these factors could result in higher costs or lower revenues than expected, resulting in lower than planned returns on investment.\nThe Utility Registrants face risks associated with their regulatory-mandated initiatives, such as smart grids and utility of the future. These risks include, but are not limited to, cost recovery, regulatory concerns, cybersecurity, and obsolescence of technology. Such initiatives may not be successful.\nThe Registrants may not realize or achieve the anticipated cost savings through the cost management efforts (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants\u2019 future financial performance and level of profitability is dependent, in part, on various cost reduction initiatives. The Registrants may encounter challenges in executing these cost reduction initiatives and not achieve the intended cost savings.\nRisks Related to the Planned Separation (Exelon and Generation)\nThe planned separation is contingent upon regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline, or at all, which could negatively affect Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nExelon is targeting to complete the separation in the first quarter of 2022, subject to final approval by Exelon\u2019s Board of Directors, a Form 10 registration statement being declared effective by the SEC, regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of other conditions. The planned separation is subject to approval by the FERC, NRC and NYPSC. There can be no assurance that any separation transaction will ultimately occur or, if one does occur, of its terms or timing. If the planned separation is not completed or is delayed, Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s consolidated financial statements may be materially adversely affected, and the market price of Exelon\u2019s common stock may be affected.\nThe plan to separate into two publicly traded companies will involve significant time and expense, which could disrupt or adversely affect our business.\nThe planned separation is complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including challenges in executing the separation, could delay or prevent the completion of the proposed separation, or cause the separation to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than expected. Additionally, Exelon\u2019s Board of Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, may decide not to proceed with the separation at any time prior to the distribution date. The process of completing the proposed separation has been and is expected to continue to be time-consuming and involves significant costs and expenses.\nThe planned separation may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits and each separate company following the separation may underperform relative to Exelon\u2019s expectations.\nBy separating the Utility Registrants and Generation, Exelon is creating two publicly traded companies with the resources necessary to best serve customers and sustain long-term investment and operating excellence. The separate companies are expected to create value by having the strategic flexibility to focus on their unique customer, market and community priorities. However, the planned separation may not provide such results on the scope or scale that Exelon anticipates, and Exelon and Generation may not realize the anticipated benefits of the planned separation. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of each separate company and their respective common stock price.\nFollowing the planned separation, the companies anticipate to maintain investment grade credit ratings. Ratings are based upon assessments of multiple factors, including a company\u2019s credit metrics as well as industry and macroeconomic changes and trends. If a rating agency were to downgrade the rating below investment grade, the separate companies\u2019 borrowing costs would increase and their funding sources could decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the affected company.\nThe common stock of the separately publicly traded companies following the separation may collectively trade at a value less than the price at which Exelon\u2019s common stock might have traded had the separation not occurred.\nThere could be significant liability if the planned spin-off is determined to be a taxable transaction.\nUnder the separation plan, Exelon shareholders will retain their current shares of Exelon stock and receive a pro-rata distribution of shares of the new company\u2019s stock in a transaction that is expected to be tax-free to Exelon and its shareholders under Sections 355 and 368 of the IRC. Exelon will seek a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding the tax-free nature of the transaction. Exelon will also seek from its tax advisors an opinion with respect to certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the spin-off. If the planned spin-off ultimately is determined to be taxable, the spin-off could be treated as a taxable dividend to Exelon\u2019s shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and Exelon\u2019s shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, Exelon would recognize a taxable gain to the extent that the fair market value of the new company\u2019s stock exceeds its tax basis in such stock on the date of the planned separation. Exelon will enter into a Tax Matters Agreement with the new company to address how post-separation issues will be managed between the companies, as well as which company is responsible for taxes imposed as a result of the planned separation, if any.\nSee Note 26 - Subsequent Events of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the planned separation.",

For additional information regarding nuclear insurance of generating facilities, see ITEM 1. BUSINESS - Exelon Generation Company, LLC. For its insured losses, Generation is self-insured to the extent that any losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect in Generation\u2019s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Utility Registrants\nThe Utility Registrants' electric substations and a portion of their transmission rights are located on property that they own. A significant portion of their electric transmission and distribution facilities are located above or underneath highways, streets, other public places, or property that others own. The Utility Registrants believe that they have satisfactory rights to use those places or property in the form of permits, grants, easements, licenses, and franchise rights; however, they have not necessarily undertaken to examine the underlying title to the land upon which the rights rest.\nTransmission and Distribution\nThe Utility Registrants\u2019 high voltage electric transmission lines owned and in service at December 31, 2020 were as follows:\n___________\n(a) In addition, PECO, DPL, and ACE have an ownership interest located in Delaware and New Jersey.

    "item_7": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExelon\nExecutive Overview\nExelon is a utility services holding company engaged in the generation, delivery, and marketing of energy through Generation and the energy distribution and transmission businesses through ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE.\nExelon has eleven reportable segments consisting of Generation\u2019s five reportable segments (Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT, and Other Power Regions), ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE. See Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 - Segment Information of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding Exelon's principal subsidiaries and reportable segments.\nExelon\u2019s consolidated financial information includes the results of its eight separate operating subsidiary registrants, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE, which, along with Exelon, are collectively referred to as the Registrants. The following combined Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations summarizes results for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, and is separately filed by Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE. However, none of the Registrants makes any representation as to information related solely to any of the other Registrants. For discussion of the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, refer to ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS in the 2019 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on February 11, 2020.\nCOVID-19. The Registrants have taken steps to mitigate the potential risks posed by the global outbreak (pandemic) of COVID-19. The Registrants provide a critical service to our customers which means that it is paramount that we keep our employees who operate our businesses safe and minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to the virus. The Registrants have taken extra precautions for our employees who work in the field and for employees who continue to work in our facilities. The Registrants have implemented work from home policies where appropriate, and imposed travel limitations on their employees. In addition, the Registrants have updated existing business continuity plans in the context of this pandemic.\nThe Registrants continue to implement strong physical and cyber-security measures to ensure that our systems remain functional in order to both serve our operational needs with a remote workforce and keep them running to ensure uninterrupted service to our customers.\nThere were no changes in internal control over financial reporting in 2020 as a result of COVID-19 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, any of the Registrants\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. See ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES for additional information.\nUnfavorable economic conditions due to COVID-19 have impacted the demand for electricity and natural gas at Generation and the Utility Registrants, which has resulted in a decrease in operating revenues.\nAs a result of COVID-19, Generation temporarily suspended interruption of service for all retail residential customers for non-payment and temporarily ceased new late payment fees for all retail customers from March to May of 2020. Starting in March of 2020, the Utility Registrants also temporarily suspended customer disconnections for non-payment and temporarily ceased new late payment fees for all customers and restored service to customers upon request who were disconnected in the last twelve months. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on such measures at the Utility Registrants. At Generation, such measures resulted in an increase in credit loss expense. ComEd and ACE recorded regulatory assets for the incremental credit loss expense based on existing mechanisms. BGE, PECO, Pepco, and DPL also recorded regulatory assets for substantially all the incremental credit loss expense incurred in 2020. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nGeneration and the Utility Registrants have also incurred direct costs related to COVID-19 consisting primarily of costs to acquire personal protective equipment, costs for cleaning supplies and services, and costs to hire healthcare professionals to monitor the health of their employees. At Generation and PECO, such costs are recorded as Operating and maintenance expense and are excluded from Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings. At ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE, such costs are primarily recorded as regulatory assets. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe estimated impact to Generation\u2019s and the Utility Registrants\u2019 Net income is approximately $170 million and $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively.\nTo offset the unfavorable impacts from COVID-19, the Registrants identified approximately $250 million in cost savings across Generation and the Utility Registrants in 2020. The cost savings achieved in 2020 were higher than originally anticipated.\nThe Registrants rely on the capital markets for publicly offered debt as well as the commercial paper markets to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs. As a result of the disruptions in the commercial paper markets in March of 2020, Generation borrowed $1.5 billion on its revolving credit facility to refinance commercial paper, which Generation repaid on April 3, 2020. Generation also entered into two short-term loan agreements in March of 2020 for an aggregate of $500 million. On April 8, 2020, Generation received approximately $500 million in cash after entering into an accounts receivable financing arrangement. On April 24, 2020, Exelon Corporate entered into a credit agreement establishing a $550 million 364-day revolving credit facility to be used as an additional source of short-term liquidity. In addition, the Registrants issued long-term debt of $5.3 billion and were able to successfully complete their planned long-term debt issuances in 2020. See Liquidity and Capital Resources, Note 17 - Debt and Credit Agreements, and Note 6 - Accounts Receivable of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Registrants assessed long-lived assets, goodwill, and investments for recoverability and there were no material impairment charges recorded in 2020 as a result of COVID-19. See Note 12 - Asset Impairments for additional information related to other impairment assessments in the third quarter of 2020. Certain assumptions are highly sensitive to changes. Changes in significant assumptions could potentially result in future impairments, which could be material.\nThis is an evolving situation that could lead to extended disruption of economic activity in our markets. The Registrants will continue to monitor developments affecting their workforce, customers, and suppliers and will take additional precautions that they determine to be necessary in order to mitigate the impacts. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact the Registrants\u2019 ability to operate their generating and transmission and distribution assets, the ability to access capital markets, and results of operations, including demand for electricity and natural gas, will depend on the spread and proliferation of COVID-19 around the world and future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.\nFinancial Results of Operations\nGAAP Results of Operations. The following table sets forth Exelon's GAAP consolidated Net Income attributable to common shareholders by Registrant for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. For additional information regarding the financial results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 see the discussions of Results of Operations by Registrant.\n__________\n(a)Primarily includes eliminating and consolidating adjustments, Exelon\u2019s corporate operations, shared service entities, and other financing and investing activities.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019. Net income attributable to common shareholders decreased by $973 million and diluted earnings per average common share decreased to $2.01 in 2020 from $3.01 in 2019 primarily due to:\n\u2022One-time charges and accelerated depreciation and amortization associated with Generation's decisions in the third quarter of 2020 to early retire Byron and Dresden nuclear facilities in 2021 and Mystic Units 8 and 9 in 2024, partially offset by the absence of accelerated depreciation and amortization due to the early retirement of TMI in September 2019;\n\u2022Impairment of the New England asset group;\n\u2022Payments that ComEd made under the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information;\n\u2022Lower capacity revenue;\n\u2022Reduction in load due to COVID-19 at Generation;\n\u2022Lower realized energy prices;\n\u2022Higher nuclear outage days;\n\u2022Impact of Generation's annual update to the nuclear ARO for Non-Regulatory Agreement Units;\n\u2022Lower net unrealized and realized gains on NDT funds;\n\u2022COVID-19 direct costs;\n\u2022Lower electric distribution earnings from lower allowed ROE due to a decrease in treasury rates, partially offset by higher rate base at ComEd;\n\u2022Higher storm costs related to the June 2020 and August 2020 storms at PECO, net of tax repairs, and related to the August 2020 storm at DPL;\n\u2022Unfavorable weather conditions at PECO, DPL Delaware, and ACE; and\n\u2022A net increase in depreciation and amortization expense due to ongoing capital expenditures at PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE, partially offset at Generation due to the impact of extending the operating license at Peach Bottom.\nThe decreases were partially offset by;\n\u2022Higher mark-to-market gains;\n\u2022Unrealized gains resulting from equity investments without readily determinable fair values that became publicly traded entities in the fourth quarter and were fair valued based on quoted market prices of the stocks as of December 31, 2020;\n\u2022Lower operating and maintenance expense at Generation primarily due to previous cost management programs, lower contracting costs, and lower travel costs, partially offset by lower NEIL insurance distributions;\n\u2022Lower nuclear fuel costs;\n\u2022A tax benefit related to a settlement in the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by the absence of a tax benefit related to certain research and development activities recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 at Generation; and\n\u2022Regulatory rate increases at BGE, DPL, and ACE.\nAdjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings. In addition to net income, Exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, and other specified items. This information is intended to enhance an investor\u2019s overall understanding of year-to-year operating results and provide an indication of Exelon\u2019s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies\u2019 presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation between Net income attributable to common shareholders as determined in accordance with GAAP and Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019:\n__________\nNote:\nAmounts may not sum due to rounding.\nUnless otherwise noted, the income tax impact of each reconciling item between GAAP Net Income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is based on the marginal statutory federal and state income tax rates for each Registrant, taking into account whether the income or expense item is taxable or deductible, respectively, in whole or in part. For all items except the unrealized gains and losses related to NDT funds, the marginal statutory income tax rates for 2020 and 2019 ranged from 26.0% to 29.0%. Under IRS regulations, NDT fund investment returns are taxed at different rates for investments if they are in qualified or non-qualified funds. The effective tax rates for the unrealized gains and losses related to NDT funds were 52.1% and 47.3% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(a)Reflects the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on Generation\u2019s NDT fund investments for Non-Regulatory and Regulatory Agreement Units. The impacts of the Regulatory Agreement Units, including the associated income taxes, are contractually eliminated, resulting in no earnings impact.\n(b)In 2020, reflects an impairment at ComEd in the second quarter of 2020 related to the acquisition of transmission assets and an impairment of the New England asset group in the third quarter of 2020. In 2019, primarily reflects the impairment of equity method investments in certain distributed energy companies. The impact of such impairment net of noncontrolling interest is $0.02.\n(c)In 2020, primarily reflects one-time charges and accelerated depreciation and amortization associated with Generation's decisions in the third quarter of 2020 to early retire Byron and Dresden nuclear facilities in 2021 and Mystic Units 8 and 9 in 2024. In 2019, primarily reflects accelerated depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the early retirement of the TMI nuclear facility and certain fossil sites and the loss on the sale of Oyster Creek to Holtec, partially offset by net realized gains related to Oyster Creek's NDT fund investments, a net benefit associated with remeasurements of the TMI ARO, and a gain on the sale of certain wind assets.\n(d)Primarily represents reorganization and severance costs related to cost management programs.\n(e)Reflects an adjustment to Generation's nuclear ARO for Non-Regulatory Agreement Units resulting from the annual update.\n(f)Represents direct costs related to COVID-19 consisting primarily of costs to acquire personal protective equipment, costs for cleaning supplies and services, and costs to hire healthcare professionals to monitor the health of employees.\n(g)Reflects the payments made by ComEd under the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, which ComEd entered into on July 17, 2020 with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Illinois.\n(h)Reflects costs related to the acquisition of EDF's interest in CENG.\n(i)Reflects costs related to a multi-year ERP system implementation.\n(j)Primarily reflects the adjustment to deferred income taxes due to changes in forecasted apportionment.\n(k)Represents elimination from Generation\u2019s results of the noncontrolling interests related to certain exclusion items. In 2020, primarily related to unrealized gains and losses on NDT fund investments for CENG units. In 2019, primarily related to the impact of unrealized gains on NDT fund investments and the impact of the Generation's annual nuclear ARO update for CENG units, partially offset by the impairment of certain equity investments in distributed energy companies.\nSignificant 2020 Transactions and Developments\nPlanned Separation\nOn February 21, 2021, Exelon\u2019s Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Utility Registrants and Generation, creating two publicly traded companies with the resources necessary to best serve customers and sustain long-term investment and operating excellence. The separation gives each company the financial and strategic independence to focus on its specific customer needs, while executing its core business strategy. See Note 26 - Subsequent Events of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nImpacts of February 2021 Weather Events and Texas-based Generating Assets Outages\nBeginning on February 15, 2021, Generation\u2019s Texas-based generating assets within the ERCOT market, specifically Colorado Bend II, Wolf Hollow II, and Handley, experienced periodic outages as a result of historically severe cold weather conditions. In addition, those weather conditions drove increased demand for service, limited the availability of natural gas to fuel power plants, and dramatically increased wholesale power and gas prices.\nExelon and Generation estimate the impact to their Net income for the first quarter of 2021 arising from these market and weather conditions to be approximately $560 million to $710 million. The estimated impact includes favorable results in certain regions within Generation\u2019s wholesale gas business. The ultimate impact to Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s consolidated financial statements may be affected by a number of factors, including final settlement data, the impacts of customer and counterparty credit losses, any state sponsored solutions to address the financial challenges caused by the event, and litigation and contract disputes which may result. Exelon expects to offset between $410 million and $490 million of this impact primarily at Generation through a combination of enhanced revenue opportunities, deferral of selected non-essential maintenance, and primarily one-time cost savings.\nSee Note 26 - Subsequent Events of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAgreement for Sale of Generation\u2019s Solar Business\nOn December 8, 2020, Generation entered into an agreement with an affiliate of Brookfield Renewable, for the sale of a significant portion of Generation\u2019s solar business, including 360 megawatts of generation in operation or under construction across more than 600 sites across the United States, for a purchase price of $810 million. Completion of the transaction is expected to occur in the first half of 2021. Generation will retain certain solar assets not included in this agreement, primarily Antelope Valley. See Note 2 - Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nEarly Retirement of Generation Facilities\nIn August 2020, Generation announced that it intends to retire the Byron Generating Station in September 2021, Dresden Generating Station in November 2021, and Mystic Units 8 and 9 at the expiration of the cost of service commitment in May 2024. As a result, in the third quarter of 2020, Exelon and Generation recognized a $500 million impairment of its New England asset group and one-time non-cash charges for Byron, Dresden, and Mystic related to materials and supplies inventory reserve adjustments, employee-related costs, and construction work-in-progress impairments, among other items. In addition, there will be ongoing annual financial impacts stemming from shortening the expected economic useful lives of these facilities, primarily related to accelerated depreciation of plant assets (including any ARC) and accelerated amortization of nuclear fuel. Such ongoing charges are excluded from Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings.\nThe following table summarizes the incremental expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the estimated amounts of incremental expense expected to be incurred through the retirement dates.\n_________\n(a)Actual results may differ based on incremental future capital additions, actual units of production for nuclear fuel amortization, future revised ARO assumptions, etc.\n(b)Reflects incremental accelerated depreciation of plant assets, including any ARC.\n(c)Reflects primarily the net impacts associated with the remeasurement of the ARO for Dresden. See Note 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n(d)Reflects contractual offset for ARO accretion, ARC depreciation, and net impacts associated with the remeasurement of the ARO for Byron and Dresden. Based on the regulatory agreement with the ICC, decommissioning-related activities are offset within Exelon's and Generation's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as long as the net cumulative decommissioning-related activities result in a regulatory liability at ComEd. Recognition of a regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning-related activities at ComEd is not permissible. The offset results in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payables to ComEd at Generation and an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at ComEd. See Note 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDeferred Prosecution Agreement\nOn July 17, 2020, ComEd entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Illinois (USAO) to resolve the USAO\u2019s investigation into ComEd\u2019s lobbying activities in the State of Illinois. Under the DPA, the USAO filed a single charge alleging that ComEd improperly gave and offered to give jobs, vendor subcontracts, and payments associated with those jobs and subcontracts for the benefit of the Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives and the Speaker\u2019s associates, with the intent to influence the Speaker\u2019s action regarding legislation affecting ComEd\u2019s interests. The DPA provides that the USAO will defer any prosecution of such charge and any other criminal or civil case against ComEd in connection with the matters identified therein for a three-year period subject to certain obligations of ComEd, including payment to the United States Treasury of $200 million, with $100 million payable within thirty days of the filing of the DPA with the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and an additional $100 million within ninety days of such filing date. The payments will not be recovered in rates or charged to customers, and ComEd will not seek or accept reimbursement or indemnification from any source other than Exelon. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.\nUtility Distribution Base Rate Case Proceedings\nThe Utility Registrants file base rate cases with their regulatory commissions seeking increases or decreases to their electric transmission and distribution, and gas distribution rates to recover their costs and earn a fair return on their investments. The outcomes of these regulatory proceedings impact the Utility Registrants\u2019 current and future financial statements.\nThe following tables show the Utility Registrants\u2019 completed and pending distribution base rate case proceedings in 2020. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these and other regulatory proceedings.\nCompleted Distribution Base Rate Case Proceedings\nPending Distribution Base Rate Case Proceedings\nTransmission Formula Rates\nThe following total increases/(decreases) were included in the Utility Registrants' 2020 annual electric transmission formula rate updates. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nSales of Customer Accounts Receivable\nOn April 8, 2020, NER, a bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity, which is wholly owned by Generation, entered into an accounts receivable financing facility with a number of financial institutions and a commercial paper conduit to sell certain customer accounts receivables. Generation received approximately $500 million of cash in accordance with the initial sale of approximately $1.2 billion receivables. See Note 6 - Accounts Receivable of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nExelon\u2019s Strategy and Outlook\nOn February 21, 2021, Exelon\u2019s Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Utility Registrants and Generation, creating two publicly traded companies with the resources necessary to best serve customers and sustain long-term investment and operating excellence. The separation gives each company the financial and strategic independence to focus on its specific customer needs, while executing its core business strategy. See Note 26 - Subsequent Events of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn 2021, the businesses remain focused on maintaining industry leading operational excellence, meeting or exceeding their financial commitments, ensuring timely recovery on investments to enable customer benefits, supporting enactment of clean energy policies, and continued commitment to corporate responsibility.\nExelon\u2019s utility strategy is to improve reliability and operations and enhance the customer experience, while ensuring ratemaking mechanisms provide the utilities fair financial returns. The Utility Registrants only invest in rate base where it provides a benefit to customers and the community by improving reliability and the service experience or otherwise meeting customer needs. The Utility Registrants make these investments at the lowest\nreasonable cost to customers. Exelon seeks to leverage its scale and expertise across the utilities platform through enhanced standardization and sharing of resources and best practices to achieve improved operational and financial results. Additionally, the Utility Registrants anticipate making significant future investments in smart grid technology, transmission projects, gas infrastructure, and electric system improvement projects, providing greater reliability and improved service for our customers and a stable return for the company.\nGeneration\u2019s competitive businesses create value for customers by providing innovative energy solutions and reliable, clean, and affordable energy. Generation\u2019s electricity generation strategy is to pursue opportunities that provide stable revenues and match supply to customers. Generation leverages its energy generation portfolio to deliver energy to both wholesale and retail customers. Generation\u2019s customer-facing activities foster development and delivery of other innovative energy-related products and services for its customers. Generation operates in well-developed energy markets and employs an integrated hedging strategy to manage commodity price volatility. Its generation fleet, including its nuclear plants which consistently operate at high capacity factors, also provide geographic and supply source diversity. These factors help Generation mitigate the current challenging conditions in competitive energy markets.\nVarious market, financial, regulatory, legislative and operational factors could affect the Registrants' success in pursuing their strategies. Exelon continues to assess infrastructure, operational, commercial, policy, and legal solutions to these issues. One key issue is ensuring the ability to properly value nuclear generation assets in the market, solutions to which Exelon is actively pursuing in a variety of jurisdictions and venues. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for additional information regarding market and financial factors.\nGrowth Opportunities\nManagement continually evaluates growth opportunities aligned with Exelon\u2019s businesses, assets and markets, leveraging Exelon\u2019s expertise in those areas and offering sustainable returns.\nRegulated Energy Businesses. The Utility Registrants anticipate investing approximately $27 billion over the next four years in electric and natural gas infrastructure improvements and modernization projects, including smart grid technology, storm hardening, advanced reliability technologies, and transmission projects, which is projected to result in an increase to current rate base of approximately $15 billion by the end of 2024. The Utility Registrants invest in rate base where beneficial to customers and the community by increasing reliability and the service experience or otherwise meeting customer needs. These investments are made at the lowest reasonable cost to customers.\nCompetitive Energy Businesses. Generation continually assesses the optimal structure and composition of its generation assets as well as explores wholesale and retail opportunities within the power and gas sectors. Generation\u2019s strategy is to ensure appropriate valuation of its generation assets, in part through public policy efforts, identify and capitalize on opportunities that match supply to customers as a means to provide stable earnings, and identify emerging technologies where strategic investments provide the option for significant future growth or influence in market development.\nOther Key Business Drivers and Management Strategies\nUtility Rates and Rate Proceedings\nThe Utility Registrants file rate cases with their regulatory commissions seeking increases or decreases to their electric transmission and distribution, and gas distribution rates to recover their costs and earn a fair return on their investments. The outcomes of these regulatory proceedings impact the Utility Registrants\u2019 current and future results of operations, cash flows, and financial positions. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these regulatory proceedings.\nPower Markets\nPrice of Fuels\nThe use of new technologies to recover natural gas from shale deposits is increasing natural gas supply and reserves, which places downward pressure on natural gas prices and, therefore, on wholesale and retail power prices, which results in a reduction in Exelon\u2019s revenues. Forward natural gas prices have declined significantly\nover the last several years; in part reflecting an increase in supply due to strong natural gas production (due to shale gas development).\nSection 232 Uranium Petition\nOn January 16, 2018, two Canadian-owned uranium mining companies with operations in the U.S. jointly submitted a petition to the U.S. Department of Commerce (\"DOC\") seeking relief under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 from imports of uranium products, alleging that these imports threaten national security.\nThe United States Nuclear Fuel Working Group (\"Working Group\") report was made public on April 23, 2020. The Working Group report states that nuclear power is intrinsically tied to national security, and promises that the U.S. government will take bold actions to strengthen all parts of the nuclear fuel industry in the U.S. It recommends the Agreement Suspending the Antidumping Investigation on Uranium from the Russian Federation (the \u201cRussian Suspension Agreement\u201d or \"RSA\") be extended and to consider reducing the amount of Russian imports of nuclear fuel. The Russian Suspension Agreement is the historical resolution of a 1991 DOC investigation that found that the Russians had been selling or \u201cdumping\u201d cheap uranium products into the U.S. The RSA has been amended several times in the intervening years to allow Russia to supply limited amounts of uranium products into the U.S. It was set to expire at the end of 2020, but was amended on October 5, 2020 to extend for another 20 years.\nThe Working Group report should be viewed as policy recommendations that may be implemented by executive agencies, congress, and or regulatory bodies. Exelon and Generation cannot currently predict the outcome of all of the policy changes recommended by the Working Group.\nComplaint at FERC Seeking to Alter Capacity Market Default Offer Caps\nOn February 21, 2019, PJM's Independent Market Monitor (IMM) filed a complaint alleging that the number of performance assessment intervals used to calculate the default offer cap for bids to supply capacity in PJM is too high, resulting in an overstated default offer cap that obviates the need for most sellers to seek unit-specific approval of their offers. The IMM claims that this allows for the exercise of market power. The IMM asks FERC to require PJM to reduce the number of performance assessment intervals used to calculate the opportunity costs of a capacity supplier assuming a capacity obligation. This would, in turn, lower the default offer cap and allow the IMM to review more offers on a unit-specific basis. It is too early to predict the final outcome of this proceeding or its potential financial impact, if any, on Exelon or Generation.\nEnergy Demand\nLoad growth at the Utility Registrants is driven by recovery from COVID-19 impacts. ComEd and PECO are projecting modest growth in load of 2.5% and 1.8%, respectively, in 2021 as compared to reduced load in 2020. BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE are projecting slower growth as prolonged COVID-19 impacts decrease load by (2.0)%, (0.8)%, (0.9)%, and (2.4)%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020.\nRetail Competition\nGeneration\u2019s retail operations compete for customers in a competitive environment, which affect the margins that Generation can earn and the volumes that it is able to serve. Forward natural gas and power prices are expected to remain low and thus we expect retail competitors to stay aggressive in their pursuit of market share, and that wholesale generators (including Generation) will continue to use their retail operations to hedge generation output.\nHedging Strategy\nExelon\u2019s policy to hedge commodity risk on a ratable basis over three-year periods is intended to reduce the financial impact of market price volatility. Generation is exposed to commodity price risk associated with the unhedged portion of its electricity portfolio. Generation enters into non-derivative and derivative contracts, including financially-settled swaps, futures contracts and swap options, and physical options and physical forward contracts, all with credit-approved counterparties, to hedge this anticipated exposure. As of December 31, 2020, the percentage of expected generation hedged for the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, and ERCOT reportable segments is 94%-97% for 2021. Generation has been and will continue to be proactive in using hedging strategies to mitigate commodity price risk.\nGeneration procures natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts and spot-market purchases. Nuclear fuel assemblies are obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services, or a combination thereof, and contracted fuel fabrication services. The supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions. Approximately 60% of Generation\u2019s uranium concentrate requirements from 2021 through 2025 are supplied by three suppliers. In the event of non-performance by these or other suppliers, Generation believes that replacement uranium concentrate can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements. Non-performance by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nSee Note 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Registrants are exposed to market risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, counterparty credit, interest rates, and equity prices. Exelon\u2019s RMC approves risk management policies and objectives for risk assessment, control and valuation, counterparty credit approval, and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures. The RMC is chaired by the chief executive officer and includes the chief risk officer, chief strategy officer, chief executive officer of Exelon Utilities, chief commercial officer, chief financial officer, and chief executive officer of Constellation. The RMC reports to the Finance and Risk Committee of the Exelon Board of Directors on the scope of the risk management activities.\nCommodity Price Risk (All Registrants)\nCommodity price risk is associated with price movements resulting from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market liquidity, weather conditions, governmental regulatory and environmental policies, and other factors. To the extent the total amount of energy Exelon generates and purchases differs from the amount of energy it has contracted to sell, Exelon is exposed to market fluctuations in commodity prices. Exelon seeks to mitigate its commodity price risk through the sale and purchase of electricity, fossil fuel, and other commodities.\nGeneration\nElectricity available from Generation\u2019s owned or contracted generation supply in excess of Generation\u2019s obligations to customers, including portions of the Utility Registrants' retail load, is sold into the wholesale markets. To reduce commodity price risk caused by market fluctuations, Generation enters into non-derivative contracts as well as derivative contracts, including swaps, futures, forwards, and options, with approved counterparties to hedge anticipated exposures. Generation uses derivative instruments as economic hedges to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. Generation expects the settlement of the majority of its economic hedges will occur during 2021 through 2023.\nIn general, increases and decreases in forward market prices have a positive and negative impact, respectively, on Generation\u2019s owned and contracted generation positions which have not been hedged. Exelon's hedging program involves the hedging of commodity price risk for Exelon's expected generation, typically on a ratable basis over three-year periods. As of December 31, 2020, the percentage of expected generation hedged for the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, and ERCOT reportable segments is 94%-97% for 2021. The percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation. Expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted generation based upon a simulated dispatch model that makes assumptions regarding future market conditions, which are calibrated to market quotes for power, fuel, load following products, and options. Equivalent sales represent all hedging products, which include economic hedges and certain non-derivative contracts, including Generation\u2019s sales to ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE to serve their retail load.\nA portion of Generation\u2019s hedging strategy may be accomplished with fuel products based on assumed correlations between power and fuel prices, which routinely change in the market. Market price risk exposure is the risk of a change in the value of unhedged positions. The forecasted market price risk exposure for Generation\u2019s entire economic hedge portfolio associated with a $5 reduction in the annual average around-the-clock energy price based on December 31, 2020 market conditions and hedged position would be a decrease in pre-tax net income of approximately $15 million for 2021. Power price sensitivities are derived by adjusting power price assumptions while keeping all other price inputs constant. Generation actively manages its portfolio to mitigate market price risk exposure for its unhedged position. Actual results could differ depending on the specific timing of, and markets affected by, price changes, as well as future changes in Generation\u2019s portfolio. See Note 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFuel Procurement\nGeneration procures natural gas through long-term and short-term contracts, and spot-market purchases. Nuclear fuel assemblies are obtained predominantly through long-term uranium concentrate supply contracts, contracted conversion services, contracted enrichment services, or a combination thereof, and contracted fuel fabrication services. The supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions. Supply market conditions may make Generation\u2019s procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or service at the contracted prices. Approximately 60% of Generation\u2019s uranium concentrate requirements from 2021 through 2025 are supplied by three suppliers. In the event of non-performance by these or other suppliers, Generation believes that replacement uranium concentrates can be obtained, although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements. Non-performance by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s financial statements.\nUtility Registrants\nComEd entered into 20-year floating-to-fixed renewable energy swap contracts beginning in June 2012, which are considered an economic hedge and have changes in fair value recorded to an offsetting regulatory asset or liability. ComEd has block energy contracts to procure electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process, which are considered derivatives and qualify for NPNS, and as a result are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting. PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE have contracts to procure electric supply that are executed through a competitive procurement process. BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE have certain full requirements contracts, which are considered derivatives and qualify for NPNS, and as a result are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting. Other full requirements contracts are not derivatives.\nPECO, BGE, and DPL also have executed derivative natural gas contracts, which either qualify for NPNS or have no mark-to-market balances because the derivatives are index priced, to hedge their long-term price risk in the natural gas market. The hedging programs for natural gas procurement have no direct impact on their financial statements. PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE do not execute derivatives for speculative or proprietary trading purposes.\nFor additional information on these contracts, see Note 3 - Regulatory Matters and Note 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTrading and Non-Trading Marketing Activities\nThe following table detailing Exelon\u2019s, Generation\u2019s, and ComEd\u2019s trading and non-trading marketing activities are included to address the recommended disclosures by the energy industry\u2019s Committee of Chief Risk Officers (CCRO).\nThe following table provides detail on changes in Exelon\u2019s, Generation\u2019s, and ComEd\u2019s commodity mark-to-market net asset or liability balance sheet position from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2020. It indicates the drivers behind changes in the balance sheet amounts. This table incorporates the mark-to-market activities that are immediately recorded in earnings. This table excludes all NPNS contracts and does not segregate proprietary trading activity. See Note 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the balance sheet classification of the mark-to-market energy contract net assets (liabilities) recorded as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n__________\n(a)Amounts are shown net of collateral paid to and received from counterparties.\n(b)For ComEd, the changes in fair value are recorded as a change in regulatory assets. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, ComEd recorded a regulatory liability of $301 million and $301 million, respectively, related to its mark-to-market derivative liabilities with Generation and unaffiliated suppliers. ComEd recorded $78 million of decreases in fair value and an increase for realized losses due to settlements of $26 million in purchased power expense associated with floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the year ended December 31, 2019. ComEd recorded $33 million of decrease in fair value and an increase for realized losses due to settlements of $33 million recorded in purchased power expense associated with floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(c)Includes derivative contracts acquired or sold by Generation through upfront payments or receipts of cash, excluding option premiums, and the associated amortizations.\nFair Values\nThe following tables present maturity and source of fair value for Exelon, Generation, and ComEd mark-to-market commodity contract net assets (liabilities). The tables provide two fundamental pieces of information. First, the tables provide the source of fair value used in determining the carrying amount of the Registrants\u2019 total mark-to-market net assets (liabilities), net of allocated collateral. Second, the tables show the maturity, by year, of the Registrants\u2019 commodity contract net assets (liabilities), net of allocated collateral, giving an indication of when these mark-to-market amounts will settle and either generate or require cash. See Note 18 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements and the fair value hierarchy.\nExelon\n__________\n(a)Mark-to-market gains and losses on other economic hedge and trading derivative contracts that are recorded in results of operations.\n(b)Amounts are shown net of collateral paid to and received from counterparties (and offset against mark-to-market assets and liabilities) of $416 million at December 31, 2020.\n(c)Includes ComEd\u2019s net assets (liabilities) associated with the floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers.\nGeneration\n__________\n(a)Mark-to-market gains and losses on other economic hedge and trading derivative contracts that are recorded in the results of operations.\n(b)Amounts are shown net of collateral paid to and received from counterparties (and offset against mark-to-market assets and liabilities) of $416 million at December 31, 2020.\nComEd\n__________\n(a)Represents ComEd\u2019s net liabilities associated with the floating-to-fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers.\nCredit Risk (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants would be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties that execute derivative instruments. The credit exposure of derivative contracts, before collateral, is represented by the fair value of contracts at the reporting date. See Note 16-Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of credit risk.\nGeneration\nThe following tables provide information on Generation\u2019s credit exposure for all derivative instruments, normal purchases and normal sales agreements, and payables and receivables, net of collateral and instruments that are subject to master netting agreements, as of December 31, 2020. The tables further delineate that exposure by credit rating of the counterparties and provide guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties and an indication of the duration of a company\u2019s credit risk by credit rating of the counterparties. The figures in the table below exclude credit risk exposure from individual retail customers, uranium procurement contracts, and exposure through RTOs, ISOs, and commodity exchanges, which are discussed below.\n__________\n(a)As of December 31, 2020, credit collateral held from counterparties where Generation had credit exposure included $31 million of cash and $25 million of letters of credit.\nThe Utility Registrants\nCredit risk for the Utility Registrants is governed by credit and collection policies, which are aligned with state regulatory requirements. The Utility Registrants are currently obligated to provide service to all electric customers within their franchised territories. The Utility Registrants record an allowance for credit losses on customer receivables, based upon historical loss experience, current conditions, and forward-looking risk factors, to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers. The Utility Registrants will monitor nonpayment from customers and will make any necessary adjustments to the allowance for credit losses on customer receivables. See Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the allowance for credit losses policy. The Utility Registrants did not have any customers representing over 10% of their revenues as of December 31, 2020. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters of the\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the regulatory recovery of credit losses on customer accounts receivable.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Utility Registrants net credit exposure to suppliers was immaterial. See Note 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features (All Registrants)\nGeneration\nAs part of the normal course of business, Generation routinely enters into physical or financial contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity, natural gas, and other commodities. In accordance with the contracts and applicable law, if Generation is downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance. Depending on Generation\u2019s net position with a counterparty, the demand could be for the posting of collateral. In the absence of expressly agreed-to provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of the demand. See Note 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding collateral requirements and Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the letters of credit supporting the cash collateral.\nGeneration transacts output through bilateral contracts. The bilateral contracts are subject to credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations. Any failure to collect these payments from counterparties could have a material impact on Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s financial statements. As market prices rise above or fall below contracted price levels, Generation is required to post collateral with purchasers; as market prices fall below contracted price levels, counterparties are required to post collateral with Generation. To post collateral, Generation depends on access to bank credit facilities, which serve as liquidity sources to fund collateral requirements. See ITEM 7. Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Matters - Exelon Credit Facilities for additional information.\nThe Utility Registrants\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Utility Registrants were not required to post collateral under their energy and/or natural gas procurement contracts. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters and Note 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nRTOs and ISOs (All Registrants)\nAll Registrants participate in all, or some, of the established, wholesale spot energy markets that are administered by PJM, ISO-NE, NYISO, CAISO, MISO, SPP, AESO, OIESO, and ERCOT. ERCOT is not subject to regulation by FERC but performs a similar function in Texas to that performed by RTOs in markets regulated by FERC. In these areas, power is traded through bilateral agreements between buyers and sellers and on the spot energy markets that are administered by the RTOs or ISOs, as applicable. In areas where there is no spot energy market, electricity is purchased and sold solely through bilateral agreements. For sales into the spot markets administered by an RTO or ISO, the RTO or ISO maintains financial assurance policies that are established and enforced by those administrators. The credit policies of the RTOs and ISOs may, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot energy market transactions be shared by the remaining participants. Non-performance or non-payment by a major counterparty could result in a material adverse impact on the Registrants\u2019 financial statements.\nExchange Traded Transactions (Exelon, Generation, PHI, and DPL)\nGeneration enters into commodity transactions on NYMEX, ICE, NASDAQ, NGX, and the Nodal exchange (\"the Exchanges\"). DPL enters into commodity transactions on ICE. The Exchange clearinghouses act as the counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the Exchanges must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, transactions on Exchanges are significantly collateralized and have limited counterparty credit risk.\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange Risk (Exelon and Generation)\nExelon and Generation use a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage interest rate exposure. Exelon and Generation may also utilize interest rate swaps to manage their interest rate exposure. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in the interest rates associated with unhedged variable-rate debt (excluding Commercial Paper) and fixed-to-floating swaps would result in approximately a $2 million decrease in Exelon pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2020. To manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international energy purchases in currencies other than U.S. dollars, Generation utilizes foreign currency derivatives, which are typically designated as economic hedges. See Note 16-Derivative Financial Instruments of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nEquity Price Risk (Exelon and Generation)\nExelon and Generation maintain trust funds, as required by the NRC, to fund certain costs of decommissioning its nuclear plants. As of December 31, 2020, Generation\u2019s NDT funds are reflected at fair value in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The mix of securities in the trust funds is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to compensate Generation for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs; however, the equity securities in the trust funds are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets, and the value of fixed-rate, fixed-income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates. Generation actively monitors the investment performance of the trust funds and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with Generation\u2019s NDT fund investment policy. A hypothetical 25 basis points increase in interest rates and 10% decrease in equity prices would result in a $851 million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets. This calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates and equity prices. See Liquidity and Capital Resources section of ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for additional information of equity price risk as a result of the current capital and credit market conditions.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneration\nGeneral\nGeneration\u2019s integrated business consists of the generation, physical delivery, and marketing of power across multiple geographical regions through its customer-facing business, Constellation, which sells electricity and natural gas to both wholesale and retail customers. Generation also sells renewable energy and other energy-related products and services.

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAnnual Nuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) Assessment\nAs described in Notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has a legal obligation to decommission its nuclear generation stations following the expiration of their operating licenses. To estimate its decommissioning obligation related to its nuclear generating stations for financial accounting and reporting purposes, management uses a probability-weighted cash flow model, which on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple scenarios that include significant estimates and assumptions such as decommissioning cost studies, cost escalation rates, probabilistic cash flow models and discount rates. Management updates its ARO annually unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on its review of updated cost studies and its annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to various scenarios. As of December 31, 2020, the nuclear decommissioning ARO was approximately $11.9 billion.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company\u2019s annual ARO assessment is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when estimating its decommissioning obligation; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s cash flow model and significant assumptions related to decommissioning cost studies. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s development of the inputs, assumptions, and model used in management\u2019s ARO assessment. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\u2019s process for developing the ARO estimates by evaluating the appropriateness of the cash flow model, testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management, and evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s significant assumptions related to decommissioning cost studies. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the results of decommissioning cost studies.\nImpairment Assessment of Long-Lived Generation Assets\nAs described in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment may include a deteriorating business climate, including, but not limited to, declines in energy prices, condition of the asset, or plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life. Management determines if long-lived assets and asset groups are impaired by comparing the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value. The expected future cash flows include significant unobservable inputs including revenue and generation forecasts, projected capital and maintenance expenditures and discount rates. As of December 31, 2020, the total carrying value of long-lived generation assets subject to this evaluation was approximately $22.2 billion.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company\u2019s impairment assessment of long-lived generation assets is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing the recoverability of these asset groups; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s significant assumptions related to revenue and generation forecasts. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s development of the inputs, assumptions, and model used to estimate the recoverability and fair value of the Company\u2019s long-lived generation asset groups. These procedures also included, among others, testing management\u2019s process for developing expected future cash flows for long-lived generation asset groups by evaluating the appropriateness of the future cash flow model, testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used by management, and evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s significant assumptions related to revenue and generation forecasts. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of revenue forecasts.\nAccounting for the Effects of Rate Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company applies the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation, which requires management to record in their consolidated financial statements the effects of cost-based rate regulation for entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria, (i) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (ii) rates are designed to recover the entity\u2019s cost of providing services or products; and (iii) there is a reasonable expectation that rates designed to recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. The Company accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with regulatory and legislative guidance from the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction under state public utility laws and the FERC under various Federal laws. Upon updates in material regulatory and legislative proceedings, where applicable, management will record new regulatory assets or liabilities and will assess whether it is probable that its currently recorded regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled, respectively, in future rates. As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately $10.0 billion of regulatory assets and approximately $10.1 billion of regulatory liabilities.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to management\u2019s accounting for the effects of rate regulation is a critical audit matter are the high degree of audit effort to assess the impact of regulation on accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities and to evaluate the complex audit evidence related to whether the regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to accounting for regulatory matters and evaluation of existing regulatory assets and liabilities. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining the Company\u2019s correspondence with regulators, evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s judgments regarding regulatory guidance and proceedings and the related accounting implications, and calculating regulatory assets and liabilities based on provisions outlined in rate orders and other correspondence with regulators.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 24, 2021\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2000.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Member of Exelon Generation Company, LLC\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, as listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)(i), and the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)(ii), of Exelon Generation Company, LLC and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d).

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Rate Regulation\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company applies the authoritative guidance for accounting for certain types of regulation, which requires management to record in their consolidated financial statements the effects of cost-based rate regulation for entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria, (i) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (ii) rates are designed to recover the entity\u2019s cost of providing services or products; and (iii) there is a reasonable expectation that rates designed to recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. The Company accounts for\nits regulated operations in accordance with regulatory and legislative guidance from the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction under state public utility laws and the FERC under various Federal laws. Upon updates in material regulatory and legislative proceedings, where applicable, management will record new regulatory assets or liabilities and will assess whether it is probable that its currently recorded regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled, respectively, in future rates. As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately $2.4 billion of regulatory assets and approximately $1.6 billion of regulatory liabilities.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to management\u2019s accounting for the effects of rate regulation is a critical audit matter are the high degree of audit effort to assess the impact of regulation on accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities and to evaluate the complex audit evidence related to whether the regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to accounting for regulatory matters and evaluation of existing regulatory assets and liabilities. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining the Company\u2019s correspondence with regulators, evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s judgments regarding regulatory guidance and proceedings and the related accounting implications, and calculating regulatory assets and liabilities based on provisions outlined in rate orders and other correspondence with regulators.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 24, 2021\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2001.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholder of Potomac Electric Power Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the financial statements, including the related notes, as listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(7)(i), and the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(7)(ii), of Potomac Electric Power Company (the \u201cCompany\u201d) (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d).

Significant Accounting Policies (All Registrants)\nDescription of Business (All Registrants)\nExelon is a utility services holding company engaged in the generation, delivery and marketing of energy through Generation and the energy distribution and transmission businesses through ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE.\nBasis of Presentation (All Registrants)\nThis is a combined annual report of all Registrants. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to the Registrants as indicated parenthetically next to each corresponding disclosure. When appropriate, the Registrants are named specifically for their related activities and disclosures. Each of the Registrant\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements includes the accounts of its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nThrough its business services subsidiary, BSC, Exelon provides its subsidiaries with a variety of support services at cost, including legal, human resources, financial, information technology, and supply management services. PHI also has a business services subsidiary, PHISCO, which provides a variety of support services at cost, including legal, accounting, engineering, customer operations, distribution and transmission planning, asset management, system operations, and power procurement, to PHI operating companies. The costs of BSC and PHISCO are directly charged or allocated to the applicable subsidiaries. The results of Exelon\u2019s corporate operations are presented as \u201cOther\u201d within the consolidated financial statements and include intercompany eliminations unless otherwise disclosed.\nExelon owns 100% of Generation, PECO, BGE, and PHI and more than 99% of ComEd. PHI owns 100% of Pepco, DPL, and ACE. Generation owns 100% of its significant consolidated subsidiaries, either directly or\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\nindirectly, except for certain consolidated VIEs, including CENG and EGRP, of which Generation holds a 50.01% and 51% interest, respectively. The remaining interests in these consolidated VIEs are included in noncontrolling interests on Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 23 - Variable Interest Entities for additional information of Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s consolidated VIEs.\nThe Registrants consolidate the accounts of entities in which a Registrant has a controlling financial interest, after the elimination of intercompany transactions. Where the Registrants do not have a controlling financial interest in an entity, proportionate consolidation, equity method accounting, or accounting for investments in equity securities with or without readily determinable fair value is applied. The Registrants apply proportionate consolidation when they have an undivided interest in an asset and are proportionately liable for their share of each liability associated with the asset. The Registrants proportionately consolidate their undivided ownership interests in jointly owned electric plants and transmission facilities. Under proportionate consolidation, the Registrants separately record their proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses related to the undivided interest in the asset. The Registrants apply equity method accounting when they have significant influence over an investee through an ownership in common stock, which generally approximates a 20% to 50% voting interest. The Registrants apply equity method accounting to certain investments and joint ventures. Under equity method accounting, the Registrants report their interest in the entity as an investment and the Registrants\u2019 percentage share of the earnings from the entity as single line items in their financial statements. The Registrants use accounting for investments in equity securities with or without readily determinable fair values if they lack significant influence, which generally results when they hold less than 20% of the common stock of an entity. Under accounting for investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values, the Registrants report their investment values based on quoted prices in active markets and realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings. Under accounting for investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, the Registrants report their investments at cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairment, and changes in measurement are reported in earnings.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for annual financial statements and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-K and Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC.\nCOVID-19 (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants have taken steps to mitigate the potential risks posed by the global outbreak (pandemic) of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The Registrants provide a critical service to their customers and have taken measures to keep employees who operate the business safe and minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to the virus, including extra precautions for employees who work in the field. The Registrants have implemented work from home policies where appropriate and imposed travel limitations on employees. In addition, the Registrants have updated their existing business continuity plans.\nManagement makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and accompanying notes, and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by those financial statements and accompanying notes. Management assessed certain accounting matters that require consideration of forecasted financial information, including, but not limited to, the Registrants' allowance for credit losses and the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets, in context with the information reasonably available to the Registrants and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of December 31, 2020 and through the date of this report. The Registrants' future assessment of their current expectations of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to their consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nUse of Estimates (All Registrants)\nThe preparation of financial statements of each of the Registrants in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Areas in which significant estimates have been made include, but are not limited to, the accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs and other AROs, pension and OPEB, inventory reserves, allowance for credit losses, goodwill and asset impairment assessments, derivative instruments, unamortized\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\nenergy contracts, fixed asset depreciation, environmental costs and other loss contingencies, taxes, and unbilled energy revenues. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Regulation (Exelon and the Utility Registrants)\nFor their regulated electric and gas operations, Exelon and the Utility Registrants reflect the effects of cost-based rate regulation in their financial statements, which is required for entities with regulated operations that meet the following criteria: 1) rates are established or approved by a third-party regulator; (2) rates are designed to recover the entities\u2019 cost of providing services or products; and (3) there is a reasonable expectation that rates designed to recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. Exelon and the Utility Registrants account for their regulated operations in accordance with regulatory and legislative guidance from the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction, principally the ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DPSC, and NJBPU, under state public utility laws and the FERC under various Federal laws. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized and the related expense or revenue is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations consistent with the recovery or refund included in customer rates. Exelon's regulatory assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date are probable of being recovered or settled in future rates. If a separable portion of the Registrants' business was no longer able to meet the criteria discussed above, the affected entities would be required to eliminate from their consolidated financial statements the effects of regulation for that portion, which could have a material impact on their financial statements. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters for additional information.\nWith the exception of income tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities, Exelon and the Utility Registrants classify regulatory assets and liabilities with a recovery or settlement period greater than one year as both current and non-current in their Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the current portion representing the amount expected to be recovered from or refunded to customers over the next twelve-month period as of the balance sheet date. Income tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities are classified entirely as non-current in Exelon's and the Utility Registrants\u2019 Consolidated Balance Sheets to align with the classification of the related deferred income tax balances.\nExelon and the Utility Registrants treat the impacts of a final rate order received after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements as a non-recognized subsequent event, as the receipt of a final rate order is a separate and distinct event that has future impacts on the parties affected by the order.\nRevenues (All Registrants)\nOperating Revenues. The Registrants\u2019 operating revenues generally consist of revenues from contracts with customers involving the sale and delivery of energy commodities and related products and services, utility revenues from ARP, and realized and unrealized revenues recognized under mark-to-market energy commodity derivative contracts. The Registrants recognize revenue from contracts with customers to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that the entities expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Generation\u2019s primary sources of revenue include competitive sales of power, natural gas, and other energy-related products and services. The Utility Registrants\u2019 primary sources of revenue include regulated electric and natural gas tariff sales, distribution, and transmission services. At the end of each month, the Registrants accrue an estimate for the unbilled amount of energy delivered or services provided to customers.\nComEd records ARP revenue for its best estimate of the electric distribution, energy efficiency, and transmission revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that ComEd believes are probable of approval by the ICC and FERC in accordance with its formula rate mechanisms. BGE, Pepco, and DPL record ARP revenue for their best estimate of the electric and natural gas distribution revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that they believe are probable of approval by the MDPSC and/or DCPSC in accordance with their revenue decoupling mechanisms. PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE record ARP revenue for their best estimate of the transmission revenue impacts resulting from future changes in rates that they believe are probable of approval by FERC in accordance with their formula rate mechanisms. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters for additional information.\nOption Contracts, Swaps, and Commodity Derivatives. Certain option contracts and swap arrangements that meet the definition of derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue or expense. The classification of revenue or expense is based on the intent of the transaction. To the extent a Utility Registrant receives full cost recovery for energy procurement and related costs from retail customers, it records the fair value of its energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers as well as\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\nan offsetting regulatory asset or liability in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters and Note 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information.\nTaxes Directly Imposed on Revenue-Producing Transactions. The Registrants collect certain taxes from customers such as sales and gross receipts taxes, along with other taxes, surcharges, and fees, that are levied by state or local governments on the sale or distribution of electricity and gas. Some of these taxes are imposed on the customer, but paid by the Registrants, while others are imposed on the Registrants. Where these taxes are imposed on the customer, such as sales taxes, they are reported on a net basis with no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. However, where these taxes are imposed on the Registrants, such as gross receipts taxes or other surcharges or fees, they are reported on a gross basis. Accordingly, revenues are recognized for the taxes collected from customers along with an offsetting expense. See Note 24 - Supplemental Financial Information for Generation\u2019s and the Utility Registrants' utility taxes that are presented on a gross basis.\nLeases (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants adopted new accounting guidance issued by the FASB related to leases as of January 1, 2019. The Registrants recognize a ROU asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases with a term of greater than one year. Operating lease ROU assets are included in Other deferred debits and other assets and operating lease liabilities are included in Other current liabilities and Other deferred credits and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance lease ROU assets are included in Plant, property, and equipment, net and finance lease liabilities are included in Long-term debt due within one year and Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The ROU asset is measured as the sum of (1) the present value of all remaining fixed and in-substance fixed payments using each Registrant\u2019s incremental borrowing rate, (2) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date (less any lease incentives received), and (3) any initial direct costs incurred. The lease liability is measured the same as the ROU asset, but excludes any payments made before the commencement date and initial direct costs incurred. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The Registrants include non-lease components for most asset classes, which are service-related costs that are not integral to the use of the asset, in the measurement of the ROU asset and lease liability.\nExpense for operating leases and leases with a term of one year or less is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the derivation of benefit from use of the leased property. Variable lease payments are recognized in the period in which the related obligation is incurred and consist primarily of payments for purchases of electricity under contracted generation and are based on the electricity produced by those generating assets. Operating lease expense and variable lease payments are recorded to Purchased power and fuel expense for contracted generation or Operating and maintenance expense for all other lease agreements on the Registrants\u2019 Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Expense for finance leases is primarily recorded to Operating and maintenance on the Utility Registrants\u2019 Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nIncome from operating leases, including subleases, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the pattern in which income is earned over the term of the lease. Variable lease payments are recognized in the period in which the related obligation is performed and consist primarily of payments received from sales of electricity under contracted generation and are based on the electricity produced by those generating assets. Operating lease income and variable lease payments are recorded to Operating revenues on the Registrants\u2019 Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nThe Registrants\u2019 operating and finance leases consist primarily of contracted generation, real estate including office buildings, and vehicles and equipment. The Registrants generally account for contracted generation in which the generating asset is not renewable as a lease if the customer has dispatch rights and obtains substantially all of the economic benefits. For new agreements entered after January 1, 2019, the Registrants generally do not account for contracted generation in which the generating asset is renewable as a lease if the customer does not design the generating asset. The Registrants account for land right arrangements that provide for exclusive use as leases while shared use land arrangements are generally not leases. The Registrants do not account for secondary use pole attachments as leases.\nSee Note 11 - Leases for additional information.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\nIncome Taxes (All Registrants)\nDeferred Federal and state income taxes are recorded on significant temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for tax benefits carried forward. Investment tax credits have been deferred in the Registrants\u2019 Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in book income over the life of the related property. The Registrants account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach; a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion; and a measurement approach that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. The Registrants recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in Interest expense, net or Other, net (interest income) and recognize penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in Other, net in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nCash and Cash Equivalents (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants consider investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents (All Registrants)\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents represent funds that are restricted to satisfy designated current liabilities. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Registrants' restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily represented the following items:\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents not available to satisfy current liabilities are classified as noncurrent assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Registrants' noncurrent restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily represented ComEd\u2019s over-recovered RPS costs and alternative compliance payments received from RES pursuant to FEJA and costs for the remediation of an MGP site, and ACE\u2019s repayment of Transition Bonds.\nSee Note 24 - Supplemental Financial Information for additional information.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Accounts Receivables (All Registrants)\nThe allowance for credit losses reflects the Registrants\u2019 best estimates of losses on the customers' accounts receivable balances based on historical experience, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nThe allowance for credit losses for Generation\u2019s retail customers is based on accounts receivable aging historical experience coupled with specific identification through a credit monitoring process, which considers current conditions and forward-looking information such as industry trends, macroeconomic factors, changes in the regulatory environment, external credit ratings, publicly available news, payment status, payment history, and the\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\nexercise of collateral calls. The allowance for credit losses for Generation wholesale customers is developed using a credit monitoring process, similar to that used for retail customers. When a wholesale customer\u2019s risk characteristics are no longer aligned with the pooled population, Generation uses specific identification to develop an allowance for credit losses. Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense on Generation\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nThe allowance for credit losses for the Utility Registrants\u2019 customers is developed by applying loss rates for each Utility Registrant, based on historical loss experience, current conditions, and forward-looking risk factors, to the outstanding receivable balance by customer risk segment. Utility Registrants' customer accounts are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements. Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are primarily recorded to Operating and maintenance expense on the Utility Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income or Regulatory assets and liabilities on the Utility Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding the regulatory recovery of credit losses on customer accounts receivable.\nThe Registrants have certain non-customer receivables in Other deferred debits and other assets which primarily are with governmental agencies and other high-quality counterparties with no history of default. As such, the allowance for credit losses related to these receivables is not material. The Registrants monitor these balances and will record an allowance if there are indicators of a decline in credit quality.\nVariable Interest Entities (Exelon, Generation, PHI, and ACE)\nExelon accounts for its investments in and arrangements with VIEs based on the following specific requirements:\n\u2022requires an entity to qualitatively assess whether it should consolidate a VIE based on whether the entity has a controlling financial interest,\n\u2022requires an ongoing reconsideration of this assessment instead of only upon certain triggering events, and\n\u2022requires the entity that consolidates a VIE (the primary beneficiary) to disclose (1) the assets of the consolidated VIE, if they can be used to only settle specific obligations of the consolidated VIE, and (2) the liabilities of a consolidated VIE for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary.\nSee Note 23 - Variable Interest Entities for additional information.\nInventories (All Registrants)\nInventory is recorded at the lower of weighted average cost or net realizable value. Provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory. Fossil fuel, materials and supplies, and emissions allowances are generally included in inventory when purchased. Fossil fuel and emissions allowances are expensed to purchased power and fuel expense when used or sold. Materials and supplies generally includes transmission, distribution, and generating plant materials and are expensed to operating and maintenance or capitalized to property, plant, and equipment, as appropriate, when installed or used.\nDebt and Equity Security Investments (Exelon and Generation)\nDebt Security Investments. Debt securities are reported at fair value and classified as available-for-sale securities. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are reported in OCI.\nEquity Security Investments without Readily Determinable Fair Values. Exelon has certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values. Exelon has elected to use the practicability exception to measure these investments, defined as cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairment. Changes in measurement are reported in earnings.\nEquity Security Investments with Readily Determinable Fair Values. Exelon has certain equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities held in NDT funds, realized and unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on Generation\u2019s NDT funds associated with the Regulatory Agreement Units are included in regulatory liabilities at Exelon, ComEd, and PECO, in Noncurrent payables to affiliates at Generation and in\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\nNoncurrent receivables from affiliates at ComEd and PECO. Realized and unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on Generation\u2019s NDT funds associated with the Non-Regulatory Agreement Units are included in earnings at Exelon and Generation. Exelon's and Generation's NDT funds are classified as current or noncurrent assets, depending on the timing of the decommissioning activities and income taxes on trust earnings. For all other equity securities with readily determinable fair values, realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings at Exelon and Generation. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding ComEd\u2019s and PECO\u2019s regulatory assets and liabilities and Note 18 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities and Note 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment (All Registrants)\nProperty, plant, and equipment is recorded at original cost. Original cost includes construction-related direct labor and material costs. The Utility Registrants also include indirect construction costs including labor and related costs of departments associated with supporting construction activities. When appropriate, original cost also includes capitalized interest for Generation, Exelon Corporate, and PHI and AFUDC for regulated property at the Utility Registrants. The cost of repairs and maintenance, including planned major maintenance activities and minor replacements of property, is charged to Operating and maintenance expense as incurred.\nThird parties reimburse the Utility Registrants for all or a portion of expenditures for certain capital projects. Such contributions in aid of construction costs (CIAC) are recorded as a reduction to Property, plant, and equipment, net. DOE SGIG and other funds reimbursed to the Utility Registrants have been accounted for as CIAC.\nFor Generation, upon retirement, the cost of property is generally charged to accumulated depreciation in accordance with the composite and group methods of depreciation. Upon replacement of an asset, the costs to remove the asset, net of salvage, are capitalized to gross plant when incurred as part of the cost of the newly-installed asset and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset. Removal costs, net of salvage, incurred for property that will not be replaced is charged to Operating and maintenance expense as incurred.\nFor the Utility Registrants, upon retirement, the cost of property, net of salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation consistent with the composite and group methods of depreciation. Depreciation expense at ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE includes the estimated cost of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement. Actual incurred removal costs are applied against a related regulatory liability or recorded to a regulatory asset if in excess of previously collected removal costs. PECO\u2019s removal costs are capitalized to accumulated depreciation when incurred and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset constructed consistent with PECO\u2019s regulatory recovery method.\nCapitalized Software. Certain costs, such as design, coding, and testing incurred during the application development stage of software projects that are internally developed or purchased for operational use are capitalized within Property, plant, and equipment. Similar costs incurred for cloud-based solutions treated as service arrangements are capitalized within Other Current Assets and Deferred Debits and Other Assets. Such capitalized amounts are amortized ratably over the expected lives of the projects when they become operational, generally not to exceed five years. Certain other capitalized software costs are being amortized over longer lives based on the expected life or pursuant to prescribed regulatory requirements.\nCapitalized Interest and AFUDC. During construction, Exelon and Generation capitalize the costs of debt funds used to finance non-regulated construction projects. Capitalization of debt funds is recorded as a charge to construction work in progress and as a non-cash credit to interest expense.\nAFUDC is the cost, during the period of construction, of debt and equity funds used to finance construction projects for regulated operations. AFUDC is recorded to construction work in progress and as a non-cash credit to an allowance that is included in interest expense for debt-related funds and other income and deductions for equity-related funds. The rates used for capitalizing AFUDC are computed under a method prescribed by regulatory authorities.\nSee Note 8 - Property, Plant, and Equipment, Note 9 - Jointly Owned Electric Utility Plant and Note 24 - Supplemental Financial Information for additional information regarding property, plant and equipment.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\nNuclear Fuel (Exelon and Generation)\nThe cost of nuclear fuel is capitalized within Property, plant, and equipment and charged to fuel expense using the unit-of-production method. Any potential future SNF disposal fees will be expensed through fuel expense. Additionally, certain on-site SNF storage costs are being reimbursed by the DOE since a DOE (or government-owned) long-term storage facility has not been completed. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional information regarding the cost of SNF storage and disposal.\nNuclear Outage Costs (Exelon and Generation)\nCosts associated with nuclear outages, including planned major maintenance activities, are expensed to Operating and maintenance expense or capitalized to Property, plant, and equipment (based on the nature of the activities) in the period incurred.\nDepreciation and Amortization (All Registrants)\nExcept for the amortization of nuclear fuel, depreciation is generally recorded over the estimated service lives of property, plant, and equipment on a straight-line basis using the group, composite or unitary methods of depreciation. The group approach is typically for groups of similar assets that have approximately the same useful lives and the composite approach is used for dissimilar assets that have different lives. Under both methods, a reporting entity depreciates the assets over the average life of the assets in the group. ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE's depreciation expense includes the estimated cost of dismantling and removing plant from service upon retirement, which is consistent with each utility's regulatory recovery method. PECO's removal costs are capitalized to accumulated depreciation when incurred, and recorded to depreciation expense over the life of the new asset constructed consistent with PECO's regulatory recovery method. The estimated service lives for the Registrants are based on a combination of depreciation studies, historical retirements, site licenses, and management estimates of operating costs and expected future energy market conditions. See Note 7 - Early Plant Retirements for additional information on the impacts of early plant retirements.\nSee Note 8 - Property, Plant, and Equipment for additional information regarding depreciation.\nAmortization of regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded over the recovery or refund period specified in the related legislation or regulatory order or agreement. When the recovery or refund period is less than one year, amortization is recorded to the line item in which the deferred cost or income would have originally been recorded in the Utility Registrants\u2019 Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Amortization of ComEd\u2019s electric distribution and energy efficiency formula rate regulatory assets and the Utility Registrants' transmission formula rate regulatory assets is recorded to Operating revenues.\nAmortization of income tax related regulatory assets and liabilities is generally recorded to Income tax expense. With the exception of the regulatory assets and liabilities discussed above, when the recovery period is more than one year, the amortization is generally recorded to Depreciation and amortization in the Registrants\u2019 Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nSee Note 3 - Regulatory Matters and Note 24 - Supplemental Financial Information for additional information regarding Generation\u2019s nuclear fuel and ARC, and the amortization of the Utility Registrants' regulatory assets.\nAsset Retirement Obligations (All Registrants)\nGeneration estimates and recognizes a liability for its legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities even though the timing and/or methods of settlement may be conditional on future events. Generation generally updates its nuclear decommissioning ARO annually, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on its annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to the multiple outcome scenarios within its probability-weighted discounted cash flow models. Generation\u2019s multiple outcome scenarios are generally based on decommissioning cost studies which are updated, on a rotational basis, for each of Generation\u2019s nuclear units at least every five years, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates. AROs are accreted throughout each year to reflect the time value of money for these present value obligations through a charge to Operating and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for Non-Regulatory Agreement Units and through a decrease to regulatory liabilities for Regulatory Agreement Units or, in the case of the Utility Registrants' accretion, through an increase to regulatory assets. See Note 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\nGuarantees (All Registrants)\nIf necessary, the Registrants recognize a liability at the time of issuance of a guarantee for the fair market value of the obligations they have undertaken by issuing the guarantee. The liability is reduced or eliminated as the Registrants are released from risk under the guarantee. Depending on the nature of the guarantee, the release from risk of the Registrant may be recognized only upon the expiration or settlement of the guarantee or by a systematic and rational amortization method over the term of the guarantee. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.\nAsset Impairments\nLong-Lived Assets (All Registrants). The Registrants regularly monitor and evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets and asset groups for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment may include a deteriorating business climate, including, but not limited to, declines in energy prices, condition of the asset, specific regulatory disallowance, or plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life. The Registrants determine if long-lived assets and asset groups are impaired by comparing the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value. See Note 12 - Asset Impairments for additional information.\nGoodwill (Exelon, ComEd, and PHI). Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not amortized, but is assessed for impairment at least annually or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. See Note 13 - Intangible Assets for additional information.\nEquity Method Investments (Exelon and Generation). Exelon and Generation regularly monitor and evaluate equity method investments to determine whether they are impaired. An impairment is recorded when the investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary in nature. Additionally, if the entity in which Generation holds an investment recognizes an impairment loss, Exelon and Generation would record their proportionate share of that impairment loss and evaluate the investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value.\nDebt Security Investments (Exelon and Generation). Declines in the fair value of debt security investments below the cost basis are reviewed to determine if such declines are other-than-temporary. If the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary, the amount of the impairment loss is included in earnings.\nEquity Security Investments (Exelon and Generation). Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured and recorded at fair value with any changes in fair value recorded through earnings. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are qualitatively assessed for impairment each reporting period. If it is determined that the equity security is impaired on the basis of the qualitative assessment, an impairment loss will be recognized in earnings to the amount by which the security\u2019s carrying amount exceeds its fair value.\nDerivative Financial Instruments (All Registrants)\nAll derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value unless they qualify for certain exceptions, including the NPNS. For derivatives intended to serve as economic hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period. Amounts classified in earnings are included in Operating revenue, Purchased power and fuel, Interest expense, or Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income based on the activity the transaction is economically hedging. While the majority of the derivatives serve as economic hedges, there are also derivatives entered into for proprietary trading purposes, subject to Exelon\u2019s Risk Management Policy, and changes in the fair value of those derivatives are recorded in revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. At the Utility Registrants, changes in fair value may be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability if there is an ability to recover or return the associated costs. Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing, or financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the nature of each transaction. On July 1, 2018, Exelon and Generation de-designated its fair value and cash flow\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\nhedges. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters and Note 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information.\nAs part of Generation\u2019s energy marketing business, Generation enters into contracts to buy and sell energy to meet the requirements of its customers. These contracts include short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy-related products in the energy markets with the intent and ability to deliver or take delivery of the underlying physical commodity. NPNS are contracts where physical delivery is probable, quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period of time and will not be financially settled. Revenues and expenses on derivative contracts that qualify, and are designated, as NPNS are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed. While these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments, they are not required to be recorded at fair value, but rather are recorded on an accrual basis of accounting. See Note 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information.\nRetirement Benefits (All Registrants)\nExelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans for essentially all current employees.\nThe plan obligations and costs of providing benefits under these plans are measured as of December 31. The measurement involves various factors, assumptions, and accounting elections. The impact of assumption changes or experience different from that assumed on pension and OPEB obligations is recognized over time rather than immediately recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Gains or losses in excess of the greater of ten percent of the projected benefit obligation or the MRV of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining service period of plan participants. See Note 15 - Retirement Benefits for additional information.\nNew Accounting Standards (All Registrants)\nNew Accounting Standards Adopted in 2020: In 2020, the Registrants adopted the following new authoritative accounting guidance issued by the FASB.\nImpairment of Financial Instruments (Issued June 2016). Provides for a new Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) impairment model for specified financial instruments including loans, trade receivables, debt securities classified as held-to-maturity investments, and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor. Under the new guidance, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity is required to recognize an allowance that reflects its current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The standard was effective January 1, 2020 and requires a modified retrospective transition approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. This standard is primarily applicable to Generation's and the Utility Registrants' trade accounts receivables balances. The guidance did not have a significant impact on the Registrants' consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill Impairment (Issued January 2017). Simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the current impairment assessment model, which requires calculation of a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Under the revised guidance, goodwill impairment will be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill (currently Step 1 of the two-step impairment assessment). Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment assessment is necessary. The standard was effective January 1, 2020 and must be applied on a prospective basis. Exelon, ComEd, and PHI adopted the new guidance in 2020. The new guidance did not impact Exelon's, ComEd's, and PHI's 2020 annual goodwill impairment assessments as they performed a qualitative assessment.\n2. Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions (Exelon and Generation)\nCENG Put Option (Exelon and Generation)\nGeneration owns a 50.01% membership interest in CENG, a joint venture with EDF, which wholly owns the Calvert Cliffs and Ginna nuclear stations and Nine Mile Point Unit 1, in addition to an 82% undivided ownership\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 2 - Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions\ninterest in Nine Mile Point Unit 2. CENG is 100% consolidated in Exelon's and Generation's financial statements. See Note 23 - Variable Interest Entities for additional information.\nOn April 1, 2014, Generation and EDF entered into various agreements including a NOSA, an amended LLC Operating Agreement, an Employee Matters Agreement, and a Put Option Agreement, among others. Under the amended LLC Operating Agreement, CENG made a $400 million special distribution to EDF and committed to make preferred distributions to Generation until Generation has received aggregate distributions of $400 million plus a return of 8.50% per annum. Under the Put Option Agreement, EDF has the option to sell its 49.99% equity interest in CENG to Generation exercisable beginning on January 1, 2016 and thereafter until June 30, 2022. On November 20, 2019, Generation received notice of EDF\u2019s intention to exercise the put option to sell its interest in CENG to Generation, and the put automatically exercised on January 19, 2020 at the end of the sixty-day advance notice period.\nUnder the terms of the Put Option Agreement, the purchase price is to be determined by agreement of the parties, or absent such agreement, by a third-party arbitration process. The third parties determining fair market value of EDF\u2019s 49.99% interest are to take into consideration all rights and obligations under the LLC Operating Agreement and Employee Matters Agreement including but not limited to Generation\u2019s rights with respect to any unpaid aggregate preferred distributions and the related return. As of December 31, 2020, the total unpaid aggregate preferred distributions and related return owed to Generation is $619 million. At this time, Generation cannot reasonably predict the ultimate purchase price that will be paid to EDF for its interest in CENG. The transaction will require approval by the NYPSC and the FERC. The FERC approval was obtained on July 30, 2020. The process and regulatory approvals are expected to close in the second half of 2021.\nAgreement for Sale of Generation\u2019s Solar Business (Exelon and Generation)\nOn December 8, 2020, Generation entered into an agreement with an affiliate of Brookfield Renewable, for the sale of a significant portion of Generation\u2019s solar business, including 360 megawatts of generation in operation or under construction across more than 600 sites across the United States. Under the terms of the transaction, the purchase price is $810 million, subject to certain working capital and other post-closing adjustments. Generation will retain certain solar assets not included in this agreement, primarily Antelope Valley.\nAs a result of the transaction, in the fourth quarter of 2020, Exelon and Generation reclassified the solar assets and liabilities on Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets as held for sale. The transaction is expected to result in an estimated pre-tax gain ranging from $75 million to $125 million. The gain will be recorded in Gain on sales of assets and businesses in Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income upon completion of the transaction. Completion of the transaction contemplated by the sale agreement is subject to the satisfaction of several closing conditions and is expected to occur in the first half of 2021. See Note 17 - Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information on the SolGen nonrecourse debt included as part of the transaction.\nDisposition of Oyster Creek (Exelon and Generation)\nOn July 31, 2018, Generation entered into an agreement with Holtec and its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, OCEP, for the sale and decommissioning of Oyster Creek located in Forked River, New Jersey, which permanently ceased generation operations on September 17, 2018. Completion of the transaction contemplated by the sale agreement was subject to the satisfaction of several closing conditions, including approval of the license transfer from the NRC and other regulatory approvals, and a private letter ruling from the IRS, which were satisfied in the second quarter 2019. The sale was completed on July 1, 2019. Exelon and Generation recognized a loss on the sale in the third quarter of 2019, which was immaterial.\nUnder the terms of the transaction, Generation transferred to OCEP substantially all the assets associated with Oyster Creek, including assets held in NDT funds, along with the assumption of liability for all responsibility for the site, including full decommissioning and ongoing management of spent fuel until the spent fuel is moved offsite. The terms of the transaction also include various forms of performance assurance for the obligations of OCEP to timely complete the required decommissioning, including a parental guaranty from Holtec for all performance and payment obligations of OCEP, and a requirement for Holtec to deliver a letter of credit to Generation upon the occurrence of specified events.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 2 - Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions\nUpon remeasurement of the Oyster Creek ARO, Exelon and Generation recognized an $84 million and a $9 million pre-tax charge to Operating and maintenance expense in 2018 and in 2019, respectively. See Note 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.\nDisposition of Electrical Contracting Business (Exelon and Generation)\nOn February 28, 2018, Generation completed the sale of its interest in an electrical contracting business that primarily installs, maintains, and repairs underground and high-voltage cable transmission and distribution systems for $87 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain which is included within Gain on sales of assets and businesses in Exelon's and Generation's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n3. Regulatory Matters (All Registrants)\nThe following matters below discuss the status of material regulatory and legislative proceedings of the Registrants.\nUtility Regulatory Matters (Exelon, PHI, and the Utility Registrants)\nDistribution Base Rate Case Proceedings\nThe following tables show the completed and pending distribution base rate case proceedings in 2020.\nCompleted Distribution Base Rate Case Proceedings\n__________\n(a)Pursuant to EIMA and FEJA, ComEd\u2019s electric distribution rates are established through a performance-based formula, which sunsets at the end of 2022. The electric distribution formula rate includes decoupling provisions and, as a result, ComEd's electric distribution formula rate revenues are not impacted by abnormal weather, usage per customer, or number of customers. ComEd is required to file an annual update to its electric distribution formula rate on or before May 1st, with resulting rates effective in January of the following year. ComEd\u2019s annual electric distribution formula rate update is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions (initial year revenue requirement). The update also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual costs incurred from the year (annual reconciliation).\nComEd\u2019s 2020 approved revenue requirement above reflects an increase of $51 million for the initial year revenue requirement for 2020 and a decrease of $68 million related to the annual reconciliation for 2018. The revenue requirement for 2020 and the revenue requirement for 2018 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 - Regulatory Matters\nbase of 6.51% inclusive of an allowed ROE of 8.91%, reflecting the monthly average yields for 30-year treasury bonds plus 580 basis points.\nComEd\u2019s 2021 approved revenue requirement above reflects an increase of $50 million for the initial year revenue requirement for 2021 and a decrease of $64 million related to the annual reconciliation for 2019. The revenue requirement for 2021 and the revenue requirement for 2019 provide for a weighted average debt and equity return on distribution rate base of 6.28% inclusive of an allowed ROE of 8.38%, reflecting the monthly average yields for 30-year treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. See table below for ComEd's regulatory assets associated with its electric distribution formula rate.\n(b) Reflects a three-year cumulative multi-year plan for 2021 through 2023. The MDPSC awarded BGE electric revenue requirement increases of $59 million, $39 million, and $42 million in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively, and natural gas revenue requirement increases of $53 million, $11 million, and $10 million in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. However, the MDPSC utilized certain tax benefits to fully offset the increases in 2021 so that customer rates will remain unchanged from 2020 to 2021. The MDPSC has deferred a decision on whether to use certain tax benefits to offset the revenue requirement increases in 2022 and 2023 and BGE cannot predict the outcome.\nPending Distribution Base Rate Case Proceedings\n_________\n(a)Pepco filed the multi-year plan enhanced proposal as an alternative to address the impacts of COVID-19. Reflects a three-year cumulative multi-year plan for 2020 through 2022 and requested revenue requirement increases of $73 million in 2022 and $63 million in 2023, to recover capital investments made during 2018 through 2020 and planned capital investments through the end of 2022.\n(b)Reflects a three-year cumulative multi-year plan for April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2024 and total requested revenue requirement increases of $56 million effective April 1, 2023 and $54 million effective April 1, 2024 to recover capital investments made in 2019 and 2020 and planned capital investments through March 31, 2024.\n(c)The rates went into effect on October 6, 2020, subject to refund.\n(d)Requested increases are before New Jersey sales and use tax. ACE intends to put rates into effect on September 8, 2021, subject to refund.\nTransmission Formula Rates (Exelon, PHI, and the Utility Registrants)\nThe Utility Registrants' transmission rates are each established based on a FERC-approved formula. ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE are required to file an annual update to the FERC-approved formula on or before May 15, and PECO is required to file on or before May 31, with the resulting rates effective on June 1 of the same year. The annual update for ComEd, BGE, DPL, and ACE is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions (initial year revenue requirement). The annual update for PECO is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions, accumulated depreciation, and accumulated deferred income taxes. The annual update for Pepco is based on prior year actual costs and current year projected capital additions, accumulated depreciation, depreciation and amortization expense, and accumulated deferred income taxes. The update for ComEd, BGE, DPL, and ACE also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect beginning June 1 of the prior year and actual costs incurred for that year (annual reconciliation). The update for PECO and Pepco also reconciles any differences between the actual costs and actual revenues for the calendar year (annual reconciliation).\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 - Regulatory Matters\nFor 2020, the following total increases/(decreases) were included in the Utility Registrants' electric transmission formula rate updates:\n__________\n(a)All rates are effective June 30, 2020 - May 31, 2021, subject to review by interested parties pursuant to review protocols of each Utility Registrant's tariff.\n(b)The decrease in PECO's transmission revenue requirement relates to refunds from December 1, 2017, in accordance with the settlement agreement dated July 22, 2019. The increase in BGE's transmission revenue requirement includes a $9 million reduction related to a FERC approved dedicated facilities charge to recover the costs of providing transmission service to specifically designated load by BGE. ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE\u2019s transmission revenue requirement include a decrease related to the April 24, 2020 settlement agreement related to excess deferred income taxes. Refer to Transmission-Related Income Tax Regulatory assets below for additional information.\n(c)Represents the weighted average debt and equity return on transmission rate bases.\n(d)As part of the FERC-approved settlement of ComEd\u2019s 2007 and PECO's 2017 transmission rate cases, the rate of return on common equity is 11.50% and 10.35%, respectively inclusive of a 50-basis-point incentive adder for being a member of a RTO, and the common equity component of the ratio used to calculate the weighted average debt and equity return for the transmission formula rate is currently capped at 55% and 55.75%, respectively. As part of the FERC-approved settlement of the ROE complaint against BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE, the rate of return on common equity is 10.50%, inclusive of a 50-basis-point incentive adder for being a member of a RTO.\nOther State Regulatory Matters\nIllinois Regulatory Matters\nEnergy Efficiency Formula Rate (Exelon and ComEd). FEJA allows ComEd to defer energy efficiency costs (except for any voltage optimization costs which are recovered through the electric distribution formula rate) as a separate regulatory asset that is recovered through the energy efficiency formula rate over the weighted average useful life, as approved by the ICC, of the related energy efficiency measures. ComEd earns a return on the energy efficiency regulatory asset at a rate equal to its weighted average cost of capital, which is based on a year-end capital structure and calculated using the same methodology applicable to ComEd\u2019s electric distribution formula rate. Beginning January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2030, the ROE that ComEd earns on its energy efficiency regulatory asset is subject to a maximum downward or upward adjustment of 200 basis points if ComEd\u2019s cumulative persisting annual MWh savings falls short of or exceeds specified percentage benchmarks of its annual incremental savings goal. ComEd is required to file an update to its energy efficiency formula rate on or before June 1st each year, with resulting rates effective in January of the following year. The annual update is based on projected current year energy efficiency costs, PJM capacity revenues, and the projected year-end regulatory asset balance less any related deferred income taxes (initial year revenue requirement). The update also reconciles any differences between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual costs incurred from the year (annual reconciliation). The approved energy efficiency formula rate also provides for revenue decoupling provisions similar to those in ComEd\u2019s electric distribution formula rate.\nDuring 2020, the ICC approved the following total increases in ComEd's requested energy efficiency revenue requirement:\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 - Regulatory Matters\n_________\n(a)ComEd\u2019s 2021 approved revenue requirement above reflects an increase of $45 million for the initial year revenue requirement for 2021 and an increase of $3 million related to the annual reconciliation for 2019. The revenue requirement for 2021 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on the energy efficiency regulatory asset and rate base of 6.28% inclusive of an allowed ROE of 8.38%, reflecting the monthly average yields for 30-year treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. The revenue requirement for 2019 provides for a weighted average debt and equity return on the energy efficiency regulatory asset and rate base of 6.56% inclusive of an allowed ROE of 8.96%, which includes an upward performance adjustment that can either increase or decrease the ROE. See table below for ComEd's regulatory assets associated with its energy efficiency formula rate.\nMaryland Regulatory Matters\nThe Maryland Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement Program (Exelon and BGE). On December 1, 2017 (as amended on January 22, 2018), BGE filed an application with the MDPSC seeking approval for a new gas infrastructure replacement plan and associated surcharge, effective for the five-year period from 2019 through 2023. On May 30, 2018, the MDPSC approved with modifications a new infrastructure plan and associated surcharge, subject to BGE's acceptance of the Order. On June 1, 2018, BGE accepted the MDPSC Order and the associated surcharge became effective January 2019. The five-year plan calls for capital expenditures over the 2019-2023 timeframe of $732 million with an associated revenue requirement of $200 million.\nCash Working Capital Order (Exelon and BGE). On November 17, 2016, the MDPSC rendered a decision in the proceeding to review BGE\u2019s request to recover its cash working capital (CWC) requirement for its POLR service, also known as SOS, as well as other components that make up the Administrative Charge, the mechanism that enables BGE to recover its SOS-related costs. The Administrative Charge is comprised of five components: CWC, uncollectibles, incremental costs, return, and an administrative adjustment, which acts as a proxy for retail suppliers\u2019 costs. The MDPSC accepted BGE's positions on recovery of CWC and pass-through recovery of BGE\u2019s actual uncollectibles and incremental costs. The order also grants BGE a return on the SOS. Subsequently, the MDPSC Staff and residential consumer advocate sought clarification and appealed the amount of return awarded to BGE on the SOS. On July 27, 2020, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s judgment affirming the MDPSC\u2019s decision. No party appealed the decision to the Maryland Court of Appeals. Also, in BGE\u2019s 2019 electric and gas distribution base rate proceeding, the MDPSC established a normalized administrative adjustment. However, a group of electric suppliers appealed the MDPSC\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. BGE cannot predict the outcome of this appeal.\nNew Jersey Regulatory Matters\nACE Infrastructure Investment Program Filing (Exelon, PHI, and ACE). On February 28, 2018, ACE filed with the NJBPU the company\u2019s IIP proposing to seek recovery of a series of investments through a new rider mechanism, totaling $338 million, between 2019-2022 to provide safe and reliable service for its customers. The IIP will allow for more timely recovery of investments made to modernize and enhance ACE\u2019s electric system. On April 15, 2019, ACE entered into a settlement agreement with other parties, which allows for a recovery totaling $96 million of reliability related capital investments from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2023. On April 18, 2019, the NJBPU approved the settlement agreement.\nAdvanced Metering Infrastructure Filing (Exelon, PHI, and ACE). On August 26, 2020, ACE filed an application with the NJBPU as was required seeking approval to deploy a smart energy network in alignment with New Jersey\u2019s Energy Master Plan and Clean Energy Act. The proposal consists of estimated costs totaling $220 million, with deployment taking place over a 3-year implementation period from approximately 2021 to 2024 that involves the installation of an integrated system of smart meters for all customers accompanied by the requisite communications facilities and data management systems. ACE is seeking authority to recover these estimated investments through a combination of the ACE IIP rider mechanism and future distribution base rates. ACE currently expects a decision in this matter in the third quarter of 2021 but cannot predict if the NJBPU will approve the application as filed.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 - Regulatory Matters\nNew Jersey Clean Energy Legislation (Exelon, PHI, and ACE). On May 23, 2018, New Jersey enacted legislation that established and modified New Jersey\u2019s clean energy and energy efficiency programs and solar and RPS. On the same day, New Jersey enacted legislation that established a ZEC program that provides compensation for nuclear plants that demonstrate to the NJBPU that they meet certain requirements, including that they make a significant contribution to air quality in the state and that their revenues are insufficient to cover their costs and risks. Electric distribution utilities in New Jersey, including ACE, began collecting from retail distribution customers, through a non-bypassable charge, all costs associated with the utility\u2019s procurement of the ZECs effective April 18, 2019. See Generation Regulatory Matters below for additional information.\nOther Federal Regulatory Matters\nTransmission-Related Income Tax Regulatory Assets (Exelon, ComEd, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE). On December 13, 2016 (and as amended on March 13, 2017), BGE filed with FERC to begin recovering certain existing and future transmission-related income tax regulatory assets through its transmission formula rate. BGE\u2019s existing regulatory assets included (1) amounts that, if BGE\u2019s transmission formula rate provided for recovery, would have been previously amortized and (2) amounts that would be amortized and recovered prospectively. On November 16, 2017, FERC issued an order rejecting BGE\u2019s proposed revisions to its transmission formula rate to recover these transmission-related income tax regulatory assets. In the fourth quarter of 2017, ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE fully impaired their associated transmission-related income tax regulatory assets for the portion of the income tax regulatory assets that would have been previously amortized.\nOn February 23, 2018 (as amended on July 9, 2018), ComEd, Pepco, DPL, and ACE each filed with FERC to revise their transmission formula rate mechanisms to permit recovery of transmission-related income tax regulatory assets, including those amounts that would have been previously amortized and recovered through rates had the transmission formula rate provided for such recovery.\nOn September 7, 2018, FERC issued orders rejecting 1) BGE\u2019s rehearing request of FERC's November 16, 2017 order and 2) the February 23, 2018 (as amended on July 9, 2018) filing by ComEd, Pepco, DPL, and ACE for similar recovery.\nOn November 2, 2018, BGE filed an appeal of FERC's September 7, 2018 order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit Court denied BGE\u2019s November 2, 2018 appeal.\nOn October 1, 2018, ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE submitted filings to recover ongoing non-TCJA amortization amounts and credit TCJA transmission-related income tax regulatory liabilities to customers for the prospective period starting on October 1, 2018. On April 26, 2019, FERC issued an order accepting ComEd's, BGE's, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's October 1, 2018 filings, effective October 1, 2018, subject to refund and established hearing and settlement judge procedures. On April 24, 2020, ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL, ACE, and other parties filed a settlement agreement with FERC, which FERC approved on September 24, 2020. The settlement agreement provides for the recovery of ongoing transmission-related income tax regulatory assets and establishes the amount and amortization period for excess deferred income taxes resulting from TCJA. The settlement resulted in a reduction to Operating revenues and an offsetting reduction to Income tax expense in the second quarter of 2020.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nRegulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because of their probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities represent the excess recovery of costs or accrued credits that have been deferred because it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates or represent billings in advance of expenditures for approved regulatory programs.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 - Regulatory Matters\nThe following tables provide information about the regulatory assets and liabilities of Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 - Regulatory Matters\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 - Regulatory Matters\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 - Regulatory Matters\nDescriptions of the regulatory assets and liabilities included in the tables above are summarized below, including their recovery and amortization periods.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 - Regulatory Matters\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 - Regulatory Matters\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 - Regulatory Matters\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 - Regulatory Matters\nCOVID-19 (Exelon and the Utility Registrants). Starting in March of 2020, the Utility Registrants temporarily suspended customer disconnections for non-payment and temporarily ceased new late payment fees for all customers and restored service to customers upon request who were disconnected in the last twelve months. The duration and extent of these measures varies by jurisdiction. While these measures are no longer in place for some jurisdictions as of December 31, 2020, they are expected to continue through the first quarter of 2021 in other jurisdictions. Typically, the Utility Registrants recover credit loss expense through regulatory required programs or distribution base rate cases. ComEd and ACE have existing mechanisms for recovery of credit loss expense. For those jurisdictions without an existing regulatory required program to recover credit loss expense, the Utility Registrants are pursuing strategies to recover incremental costs being incurred as a result of COVID-19:\n\u2022In the period of April to July of 2020, the MDPSC, the DCPSC, the DPSC, and the NJBPU issued orders authorizing the creation of regulatory assets to track incremental COVID-19 related costs.\n\u2022In May of 2020, the PAPUC issued a Secretarial Letter authorizing the creation of regulatory assets to track incremental credit loss expense related to COVID-19.\nThe Utility Registrants have also incurred direct costs related to COVID-19 consisting primarily of costs to acquire personal protective equipment, costs for cleaning supplies and services, and costs to hire healthcare professionals to monitor the health of their employees.\nThe Utility Registrants have recorded regulatory assets for the impacts of COVID-19 reflecting primarily incremental credit losses and direct costs, partially offset by a decrease in travel costs at BGE and PHI. Refer to the Regulatory assets table above for amounts as of December 31, 2020. The Utility Registrants expect to seek recovery in upcoming distribution base rate cases.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 - Regulatory Matters\nCapitalized Ratemaking Amounts Not Recognized\nThe following table presents authorized amounts capitalized for ratemaking purposes related to earnings on shareholders\u2019 investment that are not recognized for financial reporting purposes in Exelon's and the Utility Registrant's Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts will be recognized as revenues in the related Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in the periods they are billable to our customers.\n__________\n(a)Reflects ComEd's unrecognized equity returns/(losses) earned/(incurred) for ratemaking purposes on its electric distribution formula rate regulatory assets.\n(b)BGE's authorized amounts capitalized for ratemaking purposes primarily relate to earnings on shareholders' investment on its AMI programs.\n(c)Pepco's and DPL's authorized amounts capitalized for ratemaking purposes relate to earnings on shareholders' investment on their respective AMI Programs and Energy Efficiency and Demand Response Programs. The earnings on energy efficiency are on Pepco DC and DPL DE programs only.\nGeneration Regulatory Matters (Exelon and Generation)\nIllinois Regulatory Matters\nZero Emission Standard. Pursuant to FEJA, on January 25, 2018, the ICC announced that Generation\u2019s Clinton Unit 1, Quad Cities Unit 1, and Quad Cities Unit 2 nuclear plants were selected as the winning bidders through the IPA's ZEC procurement event.\nGeneration executed the ZEC procurement contracts with Illinois utilities, including ComEd, effective January 26, 2018 and began recognizing revenue with compensation for the sale of ZECs retroactive to the June 1, 2017 effective date of FEJA. The ZEC price was initially established at $16.50 per MWh of production, subject to annual future adjustments determined by the IPA for specified escalation and pricing adjustment mechanisms designed to lower the ZEC price based on increases in underlying energy and capacity prices. Illinois utilities are required to purchase all ZECs delivered by the zero-emissions nuclear-powered generating facilities, subject to annual cost caps. For the initial delivery year, June 1, 2017 to May 31, 2018, and subsequent delivery year, June 1, 2018 to May 31, 2019, the ZEC annual cost cap was set at $235 million (ComEd\u2019s share is approximately $170 million). For subsequent delivery years, the IPA-approved targeted ZEC procurement amounts will change based on forward energy and capacity prices. ZECs delivered to Illinois utilities in excess of the annual cost cap may be paid in subsequent years if the payments do not exceed the prescribed annual cost cap for that year. During the first quarter of 2018, Generation recognized $150 million of revenue related to ZECs generated from June 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017.\nNew Jersey Regulatory Matters\nNew Jersey Clean Energy Legislation. On May 23, 2018, New Jersey enacted legislation that established a ZEC program that provides compensation for nuclear plants that demonstrate to the NJBPU that they meet certain requirements, including that they make a significant contribution to air quality in the state and that their revenues are insufficient to cover their costs and risks. Under the legislation, the NJBPU will issue ZECs to qualifying nuclear power plants and the electric distribution utilities in New Jersey, including ACE, will be required to purchase those ZECs. On April 18, 2019, the NJBPU approved the award of ZECs to Salem 1 and Salem 2. Upon approval, Generation began recognizing revenue for the sale of New Jersey ZECs in the month they are generated and has recognized $69 million and $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. On May 15, 2019, New Jersey Rate Counsel appealed the NJBPU's decision to the New Jersey Superior Court. Briefing has been completed, and on December 9, 2020, oral argument took place. On October 1, 2020, PSEG and Generation filed applications seeking ZECs for the second eligibility period (June 2022 through May 2025). The NJBPU will act on the applications by the end of April 2021. Exelon and Generation cannot predict the outcome of the appeal. See Note 7 - Early Plant Retirements for additional information related to Salem.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 - Regulatory Matters\nNew York Regulatory Matters\nNew York Clean Energy Standard. On August 1, 2016, the NYPSC issued an order establishing the New York CES, a component of which is a Tier 3 ZEC program targeted at preserving the environmental attributes of zero-emissions nuclear-powered generating facilities that meet the criteria demonstrating public necessity as determined by the NYPSC to be Generation's FitzPatrick, Ginna, and Nine Mile Point nuclear facilities.\nOn November 30, 2016 (as amended on January 13, 2017), a group of parties filed a Petition in New York State court seeking to invalidate the ZEC program, which argued that the NYPSC did not have authority to establish the program, that it violated state environmental law and that it violated certain technical provisions of the State Administrative Procedures Act when adopting the ZEC program. On January 22, 2018, the court dismissed the environmental claims and the majority of the plaintiffs from the case but denied the motions to dismiss with respect to the remaining five plaintiffs and claims, without commenting on the merits of the case. On October 8, 2019, the court dismissed all remaining claims. The petitioners filed a notice of appeal on November 4, 2019 and originally had until May 4, 2020 to file their brief. Due to COVID-19 related restrictions, the court extended the deadline to July 29, 2020. Petitioners did not file a brief by the deadline, so the case is deemed dismissed. Petitioners are permitted up to one year from July 29, 2020 to file a motion to vacate the dismissal if they can show good cause for the delay.\nSee Note 7 - Early Plant Retirements for additional information related to Ginna and Nine Mile Point.\nNew England Regulatory Matters\nMystic Units 8 & 9 and Everett Marine Terminal Cost of Service Agreement (Exelon and Generation). On March 29, 2018, Generation notified grid operator ISO-NE of its plans to early retire Mystic Units 8 and 9 absent regulatory reforms on June 1, 2022. On May 16, 2018, Generation made a filing with FERC to establish cost-of-service compensation and terms and conditions of service for Mystic Units 8 & 9 for the period between June 1, 2022 - May 31, 2024. On December 20, 2018, FERC issued an order accepting the cost of service compensation, reflecting a number of adjustments to the annual fixed revenue requirement, and allowing for recovery of a substantial portion of the costs associated with the adjacent Everett Marine Terminal acquired by Generation in October 2018. Those adjustments were reflected in a compliance filing made on March 1, 2019. In the December 20, 2018 order, FERC also directed a paper hearing on ROE using a new methodology. On January 22, 2019, Exelon and several other parties filed requests for rehearing of certain findings in the order.\nOn July 17, 2020, FERC issued three orders, which together affirmed the recovery of key elements of Mystic's cost of service compensation, including recovery of costs associated with the operation of the Everett Marine Terminal. FERC directed a downward adjustment to the rate base for Mystic Units 8 and 9, the effect of which will be partially offset by elimination of a crediting mechanism for third party gas sales during the term of the cost of service agreement. A compliance filing was submitted on September 15, 2020 and is pending. Several parties filed protests to the compliance filing on the issue of how gross plant in-service was calculated and Generation filed an answer to the protests on October 21, 2020. On July 28, 2020, FERC ordered additional briefings in the ROE proceeding. On December 21, 2020, FERC issued an order on rehearing of the three July 17, 2020 orders, clarifying several cost of service provisions.\nOn August 25, 2020, a group of New England generators filed a complaint against Generation seeking to extend the scope of the claw back provision in the cost-of-service agreement, whereby Generation would refund certain amounts recovered during the term of the cost of service if it returns to market afterwards. On September 14, 2020, Generation filed an answer to the complaint arguing that the complaint is procedurally improper and a collateral attack on existing FERC orders, and pointing out that the ISO-NE tariff contains protections against the New England generators' concerns that they failed to mention. On September 28, 2020, New England generators filed an answer to Generation\u2019s answer. Generation cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.\nOn June 10, 2020, Generation filed a complaint with FERC against ISO-NE on the grounds that ISO-NE failed to follow its tariff with respect to its evaluation of Mystic for transmission security for the 2024 to 2025 Capacity Commitment Period (FCA 15) and that the modifications that ISO-NE made to its unfiled planning procedures to avoid retaining Mystic should have been filed with FERC for approval. On July 27, 2020, ISO-NE issued a memo to NEPOOL announcing its determination pursuant to its unfiled planning procedures that Mystic Units 8 and 9 are not needed for FCA 15 for transmission security. It had previously determined Mystic Units 8 and 9 are not needed for fuel security. On August 17, 2020, FERC issued an order denying the complaint. On September 16,\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 - Regulatory Matters\n2020, Generation filed a request for rehearing with FERC. On October 19, 2020, FERC denied rehearing by operation of law and on December 18, 2020, Generation appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The timing and the outcome of this proceeding is uncertain.\nSee Note 7 - Early Plant Retirements and Note 12 - Asset Impairments for additional information on the impacts of Generation\u2019s August 2020 decision to retire Mystic Units 8 & 9 upon expiration of the cost of service agreement.\nFederal Regulatory Matters\nPJM and NYISO MOPR Proceedings. PJM and NYISO capacity markets include a MOPR. If a resource is subjected to a MOPR, its offer is adjusted to effectively remove the revenues it receives through a state government-provided financial support program - resulting in a higher offer that may not clear the capacity market. Prior to December 19, 2019, the MOPR in PJM applied only to certain new gas-fired resources. Currently, the MOPR in NYISO applies only to certain resources in downstate New York.\nFor Generation\u2019s facilities in PJM and NYISO that are currently receiving ZEC compensation, an expanded MOPR would require exclusion of ZEC compensation when bidding into future capacity auctions, resulting in an increased risk of these facilities not receiving capacity revenues in future auctions.\nOn December 19, 2019, FERC required PJM to broadly apply the MOPR to all new and existing resources including nuclear, renewables, demand response, energy efficiency, storage, and all resources owned by vertically-integrated utilities. This greatly expands the breadth and scope of PJM\u2019s MOPR, which is effective as of PJM\u2019s next capacity auction. While FERC included some limited exemptions, no exemptions were available to state-supported nuclear resources.\nFERC provided no new mechanism for accommodating state-supported resources other than the existing FRR mechanism (under which an entire utility zone would be removed from PJM\u2019s capacity auction along with sufficient resources to support the load in such zone). In response to FERC\u2019s order, PJM submitted a compliance filing on March 18, 2020 wherein PJM proposed tariff language interpreting and implementing FERC's directives, and proposed a schedule for resuming capacity auctions that is contingent on the timing of FERC's action on the compliance filing.\nOn April 16, 2020, FERC issued an order largely denying most requests for rehearing of FERC's December 2019 order but granting a few clarifications that required an additional PJM compliance filing which PJM submitted on June 1, 2020.\nOn October 15, 2020, FERC issued an order denying requests for rehearing of its April 16, 2020 order and accepting PJM\u2019s two compliance filings, subject to a further compliance filing to revise minor aspects of the proposed MOPR methodology. As part of that order, FERC also accepted PJM\u2019s proposal to condense the schedule of activities leading up to the next capacity auction. In November 2020, PJM announced that it will conduct its next capacity auction beginning on May 19, 2021 and ending on May 25, 2021 and will post the results on June 2, 2021.\nBecause neither Illinois nor New Jersey have implemented an FRR program in their PJM zones, the MOPR will apply in that next capacity auction to Generation's owned or jointly owned nuclear plants in those states receiving a benefit under the Illinois ZES, or the New Jersey ZEC program, as applicable, increasing the risk that those units may not clear the capacity market.\nExelon is currently working with PJM and other stakeholders to pursue the FRR option as an alternative to the PJM capacity auction. If Illinois implements the FRR option, Generation\u2019s Illinois nuclear plants could be removed from PJM\u2019s capacity auction and instead supply capacity, and be compensated under the FRR program, which has the potential to mitigate the current economic distress being experienced by Generation's nuclear plants in Illinois, as discussed in Note 7 - Early Plant Retirements. Implementing the FRR program in Illinois will require both legislative and regulatory changes. Whether legislation is needed in New Jersey would depend on how the state chooses to structure an FRR program. Exelon cannot predict whether or when such legislative and regulatory changes can be implemented.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 - Regulatory Matters\nOn February 20, 2020, FERC issued an order rejecting requests to expand NYISO\u2019s version of the MOPR (referred to as buyer-side mitigation rules) beyond its current limited applicability to certain resources in downstate. However, on October 14, 2020, two natural gas-fired generators in New York filed a complaint at FERC seeking to expand the MOPR in NYISO to apply to all resources, new and existing, across the entire NYISO market. Exelon is strenuously opposing expansion of FERC\u2019s MOPR policies in the NYISO market. While it is too early in the proceeding to predict its outcome and there are significant differences between the NYISO and PJM markets that would justify a different result, if FERC follows its MOPR precedent in PJM and applies the MOPR in NYISO broadly as requested in the complaint, Generation\u2019s facilities in NYISO that are receiving ZEC compensation may be at increased risk of not clearing the capacity auction.\nIf Generation\u2019s state-supported nuclear plants in PJM or NYISO are subjected to the MOPR or equivalent without compensation under an FRR or similar program, it could have a material adverse impact on Exelon's and Generation's financial statements, which Exelon and Generation cannot reasonably estimate at this time.\nOperating License Renewals\nConowingo Hydroelectric Project. On August 29, 2012, Generation submitted a hydroelectric license application to FERC for a new license for the Conowingo Hydroelectric Project (Conowingo). In connection with Generation\u2019s efforts to obtain a water quality certification pursuant to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (401 Certification) from MDE for Conowingo, Generation has been working with MDE and other stakeholders to resolve water quality licensing issues, including: (1) water quality, (2) fish habitat, and (3) sediment.\nOn April 21, 2016, Generation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior executed a settlement agreement (DOI Settlement) resolving all fish passage issues between the parties.\nOn April 27, 2018, MDE issued its 401 Certification for Conowingo. As issued, the 401 Certification contains numerous conditions, including those relating to reduction of nutrients from upstream sources, removal of all visible trash and debris from upstream sources, and implementation of measures relating to fish passage, which could have a material, unfavorable impact on Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s financial statements through an increase in capital expenditures and operating costs if implemented. On May 25, 2018, Generation filed complaints in federal and state court, along with a petition for reconsideration with MDE, alleging that the conditions are unfair and onerous and in violation of MDE regulations and state, federal, and constitutional law. Generation also requested that FERC defer the issuance of the federal license while these significant state and federal law issues are pending. On February 28, 2019, Generation filed a Petition for Declaratory Order with FERC requesting that FERC issue an order declaring that MDE waived its right to issue a 401 Certification for Conowingo because it failed to timely act on Conowingo\u2019s 401 Certification application and requesting that FERC decline to include the conditions required by MDE in April 2018.\nOn October 29, 2019, Generation and MDE filed with FERC a Joint Offer of Settlement (Offer of Settlement) that would resolve all outstanding issues relating to the 401 Certification. Pursuant to the Offer of Settlement, the parties submitted Proposed License Articles to FERC to be incorporated by FERC into the new license in accordance with FERC\u2019s discretionary authority under the Federal Power Act. Among the Proposed License Articles are modifications to river flows to improve aquatic habitat, eel passage improvements, and initiatives to support rare, threatened and endangered wildlife. If FERC approves the Offer of Settlement and incorporates the Proposed License Articles into the new license without modification, then MDE would waive its rights to issue a 401 Certification and Generation would agree, pursuant to a separate agreement with MDE (MDE Settlement), to implement additional environmental protection, mitigation, and enhancement measures over the anticipated 50-year term of the new license. These measures address mussel restoration and other ecological and water quality matters, among other commitments. Exelon\u2019s commitments under the various provisions of the Offer of Settlement and MDE Settlement are not effective unless and until FERC approves the Offer of Settlement, and issues the new license with the Proposed License Articles.\nThe financial impact of the DOI and MDE Settlements and other anticipated license commitments are estimated to be $11 million to $14 million per year, on average, recognized over the new license term, including capital and operating costs. The actual timing and amount of the majority of these costs are not currently fixed and will vary from year to year throughout the life of the new license. Generation cannot currently predict when FERC will issue the new license. As of December 31, 2020, $45 million of direct costs associated with Conowingo licensing efforts have been capitalized. Generation's current depreciation provision for Conowingo assumes renewal of the FERC license.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 3 - Regulatory Matters\nPeach Bottom Units 2 and 3. On July 10, 2018, Generation submitted a second 20-year license renewal application with the NRC for Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3, which was approved on March 6, 2020. Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3 are now licensed to operate through 2053 and 2054, respectively. See Note 8 - Property, Plant, and Equipment for additional information regarding the estimated useful life and depreciation provisions for Peach Bottom.\n4. Revenue from Contracts with Customers (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants recognize revenue from contracts with customers to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entities expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Generation\u2019s primary sources of revenue include competitive sales of power, natural gas, and other energy-related products and services. The Utility Registrants\u2019 primary sources of revenue include regulated electric and gas tariff sales, distribution, and transmission services. The performance obligations, revenue recognition, and payment terms associated with these sources of revenue are further discussed in the table below. There are no significant financing components for these sources of revenue and no variable consideration for regulated electric and gas tariff sales and regulated transmission services unless noted below.\nUnless otherwise noted, for each of the significant revenue categories and related performance obligations described below, the Registrants have the right to consideration from the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value transferred to the customer for the performance completed to date. Therefore, the Registrants generally recognize revenue in the amount for which they have the right to invoice the customer. As a result, there are generally no significant judgments used in determining or allocating the transaction price.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 4 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n__________\n(a)Certain contracts may contain limits on the total amount of revenue Exelon and Generation are able to collect over the entire term of the contract. In such cases, Exelon and Generation estimate the total consideration expected to be received over the term of the contract net of the constraint and allocate the expected consideration to the performance obligations\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 4 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nin the contract such that revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the entire contract as the performance obligations are satisfied.\n(b)The method recognizes revenue based on the various inputs used to satisfy the performance obligation, such as costs incurred and total labor hours expended. The total amount of revenue that will be recognized is based on the agreed upon contractually-stated amount. The average contract term for these projects is approximately 18 months.\n(c)Electric and natural gas utility customers have the choice to purchase electricity or natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers. While the Utility Registrants are required under state legislation to bill their customers for the supply and distribution of electricity and/or natural gas, they recognize revenue related only to the distribution services when customers purchase their electricity or natural gas from competitive suppliers.\n(d)Passage of time is used for NITS and access to the wholesale grid and MWHs of energy transported over the wholesale grid is used for scheduling, system control and dispatch services.\nGeneration incurs incremental costs in order to execute certain retail power and gas sales contracts. These costs, which primarily relate to retail broker fees and sales commissions, are capitalized when incurred as contract acquisition costs and were immaterial as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Utility Registrants do not incur any material costs to obtain or fulfill contracts with customers.\nContract Balances (All Registrants)\nContract Assets\nGeneration records contract assets for the revenue recognized on the construction and installation of energy efficiency assets and new power generating facilities before Generation has an unconditional right to bill for and receive the consideration from the customer. These contract assets are subsequently reclassified to receivables when the right to payment becomes unconditional. Generation records contract assets and contract receivables within Other current assets and Customer accounts receivable, net, respectively, within Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the contract assets reflected in Exelon's and Generation's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Utility Registrants do not have any contract assets.\n__________\n(a)Represents contract assets related to Generation's solar business, which were classified as held for sale as a result of the sale agreement. See Note 2 - Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions for additional information.\nContract Liabilities\nThe Registrants record contract liabilities when consideration is received or due prior to the satisfaction of the performance obligations. The Registrants record contract liabilities within Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities within the Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor Generation, these contract liabilities primarily relate to upfront consideration received or due for equipment service plans, solar panel leases, and the Illinois ZEC program that introduces a cap on the total consideration to be received by Generation. The Generation contract liability related to the Illinois ZEC program includes certain amounts with ComEd that are eliminated in consolidation in Exelon\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn July 1, 2020, Pepco, DPL, and ACE each entered into a collaborative arrangement with an unrelated owner and manager of communication infrastructure (the Buyer). Under this arrangement, Pepco, DPL, and ACE sold a 60% undivided interest in their respective portfolios of transmission tower attachment agreements with\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 4 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers\ntelecommunications companies to the Buyer, in addition to transitioning management of the day-to-day operations of the jointly-owned agreements to the Buyer for 35 years, while retaining the safe and reliable operation of its utility assets. In return, Pepco, DPL, and ACE will provide the Buyer limited access on the portion of the towers where the equipment resides for the purposes of managing the agreements for the benefit of Pepco, DPL, ACE, and the Buyer. In addition, for an initial period of three years and two, two-year extensions that are subject to certain conditions, the Buyer has the exclusive right to enter into new agreements with telecommunications companies and to receive a 30% undivided interest in those new agreements. PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE received cash and recorded contract liabilities as of July 1, 2020 as shown in the table below. The revenue attributable to this arrangement will be recognized as operating revenue over the 35 years under the collaborative arrangement.\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the contract liabilities reflected in Exelon's, Generation's, PHI's, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE'S Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, ComEd's, PECO's, and BGE's contract liabilities were immaterial.\n__________\n(a)Represents contract liabilities related to Generation's solar business, which were classified as held for sale as a result of the sale agreement. See Note 2 - Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions for additional information.\nThe following table reflects revenues recognized in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, which were included in contract liabilities at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively:\nTransaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations (All Registrants)\nThe following table shows the amounts of future revenues expected to be recorded in each year for performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of December 31, 2020. This disclosure only includes contracts for which the total consideration is fixed and determinable at contract inception. The average contract term varies by customer type and commodity but ranges from one month to several years.\nThis disclosure excludes Generation's power and gas sales contracts as they contain variable volumes and/or variable pricing. This disclosure also excludes the Utility Registrants' gas and electric tariff sales contracts and transmission revenue contracts as they generally have an original expected duration of one year or less and, therefore, do not contain any future, unsatisfied performance obligations to be included in this disclosure.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 4 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nRevenue Disaggregation (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants disaggregate revenue recognized from contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. See Note 5 - Segment Information for the presentation of the Registrant's revenue disaggregation.\n5. Segment Information (All Registrants)\nOperating segments for each of the Registrants are determined based on information used by the CODM in deciding how to evaluate performance and allocate resources at each of the Registrants.\nExelon has eleven reportable segments, which include Generation's five reportable segments consisting of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT, and all other power regions referred to collectively as \u201cOther Power Regions\u201d and ComEd, PECO, BGE, and PHI's three reportable segments consisting of Pepco, DPL, and ACE. ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE each represent a single reportable segment, and as such, no separate segment information is provided for these Registrants. Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE's CODMs evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE based on net income.\nThe basis for Generation's reportable segments is the integrated management of its electricity business that is located in different geographic regions, and largely representative of the footprints of ISO/RTO and/or NERC regions, which utilize multiple supply sources to provide electricity through various distribution channels (wholesale and retail). Generation's hedging strategies and risk metrics are also aligned to these same geographic regions. Descriptions of each of Generation\u2019s five reportable segments are as follows:\n\u2022Mid-Atlantic represents operations in the eastern half of PJM, which includes New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, the District of Columbia, and parts of Pennsylvania and North Carolina.\n\u2022Midwest represents operations in the western half of PJM and the United States footprint of MISO, excluding MISO\u2019s Southern Region.\n\u2022New York represents operations within NYISO.\n\u2022ERCOT represents operations within Electric Reliability Council of Texas.\n\u2022Other Power Regions:\n\u2022New England represents operations within ISO-NE.\n\u2022South represents operations in the FRCC, MISO\u2019s Southern Region, and the remaining portions of the SERC not included within MISO or PJM.\n\u2022West represents operations in the WECC, which includes CAISO.\n\u2022Canada represents operations across the entire country of Canada and includes AESO, OIESO, and the Canadian portion of MISO.\nThe CODMs for Exelon and Generation evaluate the performance of Generation\u2019s electric business activities and allocate resources based on RNF. Generation believes that RNF is a useful measurement of operational performance. RNF is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies\u2019\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 5 - Segment Information\npresentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Generation\u2019s operating revenues include all sales to third parties and affiliated sales to the Utility Registrants. Purchased power costs include all costs associated with the procurement and supply of electricity including capacity, energy, and ancillary services. Fuel expense includes the fuel costs for Generation\u2019s owned generation and fuel costs associated with tolling agreements. The results of Generation's other business activities are not regularly reviewed by the CODM and are therefore not classified as operating segments or included in the regional reportable segment amounts. These activities include natural gas, as well as other miscellaneous business activities that are not significant to Generation's overall operating revenues or results of operations. Further, Generation\u2019s unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on economic hedging activities and its amortization of certain intangible assets and liabilities relating to commodity contracts recorded at fair value from mergers and acquisitions are also excluded from the regional reportable segment amounts. Exelon and Generation do not use a measure of total assets in making decisions regarding allocating resources to or assessing the performance of these reportable segments.\nAn analysis and reconciliation of the Registrants\u2019 reportable segment information to the respective information in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 is as follows:\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 5 - Segment Information\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 5 - Segment Information\n__________\n(a)Other primarily includes Exelon\u2019s corporate operations, shared service entities, and other financing and investment activities.\n(b)Includes gross utility tax receipts from customers. The offsetting remittance of utility taxes to the governing bodies is recorded in expenses in the Registrants\u2019 Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. See Note 24 - Supplemental Financial Information for additional information on total utility taxes.\n(c)Intersegment revenues exclude sales to unconsolidated affiliates. The intersegment profit associated with Generation\u2019s sale of certain products and services by and between Exelon\u2019s segments is not eliminated in consolidation due to the recognition of intersegment profit in accordance with regulatory accounting guidance. For Exelon, these amounts are included in Operating revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. See Note 25 - Related Party Transactions for additional information on intersegment revenues.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 5 - Segment Information\nPHI:\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 5 - Segment Information\n__________\n(a)Other primarily includes PHI\u2019s corporate operations, shared service entities, and other financing and investment activities.\n(b)Includes gross utility tax receipts from customers. The offsetting remittance of utility taxes to the governing bodies is recorded in expenses in the Registrants\u2019 Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. See Note 24 - Supplemental Financial Information for additional information on total utility taxes.\n(c)Includes intersegment revenues with ComEd, BGE, and PECO, which are eliminated at Exelon.\n(d)The Income (loss) before income taxes in Other and Intersegment Eliminations have been adjusted by an offsetting $489 million and $408 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and Total assets amounts in Other and Intersegment Eliminations have been adjusted by an offsetting $5.7 billion in 2019 for consistency with the Exelon consolidating disclosure above.\nThe following tables disaggregate the Registrants' revenue recognized from contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. For Generation, the disaggregation of revenues reflects Generation's two primary products of power sales and natural gas sales, with further disaggregation of power sales provided by geographic region. For the Utility Registrants, the disaggregation of revenues reflects the two primary utility services of rate-regulated electric sales and rate-regulated natural gas sales (where applicable), with further disaggregation of these tariff sales provided by major customer groups. Exelon's disaggregated revenues are consistent with Generation and the Utility Registrants, but exclude any intercompany revenues.\nCompetitive Business Revenues (Generation):\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 5 - Segment Information\n__________\n(a)Includes all wholesale and retail electric sales to third parties and affiliated sales to the Utility Registrants.\n(b)Includes revenues from derivatives and leases.\n(c)Represents activities not allocated to a region.

The Facility, whose maximum capacity is $750 million, is scheduled to expire on April 7, 2021, unless renewed by the mutual consent of the parties in accordance with its terms. Under the Facility, NER may sell eligible short-term customer accounts receivable to the Purchasers in exchange for cash and subordinated interest. The transfers are reported as sales of receivables in Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s consolidated financial statements. The subordinated interest in collections upon the receivables sold to the Purchasers is referred to as the DPP, which is reflected in Other current assets on Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nOn April 8, 2020, Generation derecognized and transferred approximately $1.2 billion of receivables at fair value to the Purchasers in exchange for approximately $500 million in cash purchase price and $650 million of DPP. On February 17, 2021, Generation received additional cash of $250 million from the Purchasers for the remaining capacity in the Facility.\nThe following table summarizes the impact of the sale of certain receivables:\n_________\n(a)Includes additional customer accounts receivable sold into the Facility of $6,608 million since the start of the financing agreement.\n_________\n(a)Reflected in Operating and maintenance expense on Exelon and Generation's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nGeneration\u2019s risk of loss following the transfer of accounts receivable is limited to the DPP outstanding. Payment of DPP is not subject to significant risks other than delinquencies and credit losses on accounts receivable transferred, which have historically been and are expected to be immaterial. Generation continues to service the receivables sold in exchange for a servicing fee. Generation did not record a servicing asset or liability as the servicing fees were immaterial.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 6 - Accounts Receivable\nGeneration recognizes the cash proceeds received upon sale in Net cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The collection and reinvestment of DPP is recognized in Net cash provided by investing activities of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nSee Note 18 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities and Note 23 - Variable Interest Entities for additional information.\nOther Purchases and Sales of Customer and Other Accounts Receivables (All Registrants)\nGeneration is required, under supplier tariffs in ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO, and PJM, to sell customer and other receivables to utility companies, which include the Utility Registrants. The Utility Registrants are required, under separate legislation and regulations in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland, District of Columbia, and New Jersey, to purchase certain receivables from alternative retail electric and, as applicable, natural gas suppliers that participate in the utilities' consolidated billing. The following tables present the total receivables purchased and sold for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n7. Early Plant Retirements (Exelon and Generation)\nExelon and Generation continuously evaluate factors that affect the current and expected economic value of Generation\u2019s plants, including, but not limited to: market power prices, results of capacity auctions, potential legislative and regulatory solutions to ensure plants are fairly compensated for benefits they provide through their carbon-free emissions, reliability, or fuel security, and the impact of potential rules from the EPA requiring reduction of carbon and other emissions and the efforts of states to implement those final rules. The precise timing of an early retirement date for any plant, and the resulting financial statement impacts, may be affected by many factors, including the status of potential regulatory or legislative solutions, results of any transmission system reliability study assessments, the nature of any co-owner requirements and stipulations, and NDT fund requirements for nuclear plants, among other factors. However, the earliest retirement date for any plant would usually be the first year in which the unit does not have capacity or other obligations, and where applicable, just prior to its next scheduled nuclear refueling outage.\nNuclear Generation\nIn 2015 and 2016, Generation identified the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear plants in Illinois, Ginna and Nine Mile Point nuclear plants in New York, and TMI nuclear plant in Pennsylvania as having the greatest risk of early retirement based on economic valuation and other factors. In 2017, PSEG made public similar financial challenges facing its New Jersey nuclear plants, including Salem, of which Generation owns a 42.59% ownership interest. PSEG is the operator of Salem and also has the decision-making authority to retire Salem.\nAssuming the continued effectiveness of the Illinois ZES, New Jersey ZEC program, and the New York CES, Generation and CENG, through its ownership of Ginna and Nine Mile Point, no longer consider Clinton, Quad Cities, Salem, Ginna, or Nine Mile Point to be at heightened risk for early retirement. However, to the extent the Illinois ZES, New Jersey ZEC program, or the New York CES do not operate as expected over their full terms,\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 7 - Early Plant Retirements\neach of these plants, in addition to FitzPatrick, would be at heightened risk for early retirement, which could have a material impact on Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s future financial statements. In addition, FERC\u2019s December 19, 2019 order on the MOPR in PJM may undermine the continued effectiveness of the Illinois ZES and the New Jersey ZEC program unless Illinois and New Jersey implement an FRR mechanism under which the Generation plants in these states would be removed from PJM\u2019s capacity auction. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters for additional information on the Illinois ZES, New Jersey ZEC program, New York CES, and FERC's December 19, 2019 order on the MOPR in PJM.\nIn Pennsylvania, the TMI nuclear plant did not clear in the May 2017 PJM capacity auction for the 2020-2021 planning year, the third consecutive year that TMI failed to clear the PJM base residual capacity auction and on May 30, 2017, based on these capacity auction results, prolonged periods of low wholesale power prices, and the absence of federal or state policies that place a value on nuclear energy for its ability to produce electricity without air pollution, Generation announced that it would permanently cease generation operations at TMI. On September 20, 2019, Generation permanently ceased generation operations at TMI.\nGeneration\u2019s Dresden, Byron, and Braidwood nuclear plants in Illinois are also showing increased signs of economic distress, in a market that does not currently compensate them for their unique contribution to grid resiliency and their ability to produce large amounts of energy without carbon and air pollution. The May 2018 PJM capacity auction for the 2021-2022 planning year resulted in the largest volume of nuclear capacity ever not selected in the auction, including all of Dresden, and portions of Byron and Braidwood. While all of LaSalle's capacity did clear in the 2021-2022 planning year auction, Generation has become increasingly concerned about the economic viability of this plant as well in a landscape where energy market prices remain depressed and energy market rules remain fatally flawed.\nOn August 27, 2020, Generation announced that it intends to permanently cease generation operations at Byron in September 2021 and at Dresden in November 2021. The current NRC licenses for Byron Units 1 and 2 expire in 2044 and 2046, respectively, and the licenses for Dresden Units 2 and 3 expire in 2029 and 2031, respectively.\nAs a result of the decision to early retire Byron and Dresden, Exelon and Generation recognized certain one-time charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to materials and supplies inventory reserve adjustments, employee-related costs, including severance benefit costs further discussed below, and construction work-in-progress impairments, among other items. In addition, as a result of the decisions to early retire Byron and Dresden, there are ongoing annual financial impacts stemming from shortening the expected economic useful lives of these nuclear plants primarily related to accelerated depreciation of plant assets (including any ARC), accelerated amortization of nuclear fuel, and changes in ARO accretion expense associated with the changes in decommissioning timing and cost assumptions to reflect an earlier retirement date. See Note 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information on changes to the nuclear decommissioning ARO balance and Note 12 - Asset Impairments for impairment assessment considerations given to the Midwest asset group as a result of the early retirement decision. The total impact on Exelon's and Generation's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income is summarized in the table below.\n_________\n(a)Reflects expense for Byron and Dresden.\n(b)Reflects expense for TMI.\n(c)Reflects expense for TMI and Oyster Creek.\n(d)Includes the accelerated depreciation of plant assets including any ARC.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 7 - Early Plant Retirements\n(e)For Dresden, reflects the net impacts associated with the remeasurement of the ARO. For TMI, primarily reflects the net impacts associated with the remeasurement of the ARO. See Note 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.\n(f)Reflects contractual offset for ARO accretion, ARC depreciation, and net impacts associated with the remeasurement of the ARO. For Byron and Dresden, based on the regulatory agreement with the ICC, decommissioning-related activities in 2020 have been offset within Exelon's and Generation's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The offset in 2020 resulted in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payables to ComEd at Generation and an adjustment to the regulatory liabilities at ComEd. See Note 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information.\nSeverance benefit costs will be provided to employees impacted by the early retirements of Byron and Dresden, to the extent they are not redeployed to other nuclear plants. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Exelon and Generation recorded severance expense of $81 million within Operating and maintenance expense in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The final amount of severance benefit costs will depend on the specific employees severed.\nThe following table provides the balance sheet amounts as of December 31, 2020 for Exelon's and Generation's significant assets and liabilities associated with the Braidwood and LaSalle nuclear plants. Current depreciation provisions are based on the estimated useful lives of these nuclear generating stations, which reflect the first renewal of the operating licenses.\nExelon continues to work with stakeholders on state policy solutions, while also advocating for broader market reforms at the regional and federal level. The absence of such solutions or reforms could result in future impairments of the Midwest asset group, or accelerated depreciation for specific plants over their shortened estimated useful lives, both of which could have a material unfavorable impact on Exelon's and Generation's future results of operations.\nOther Generation\nIn March 2018, Generation notified ISO-NE of its plans to early retire, among other assets, the Mystic Generating Station's units 8 and 9 (Mystic 8 and 9) absent regulatory reforms to properly value reliability and regional fuel security. Thereafter, ISO-NE identified Mystic 8 and 9 as being needed to ensure fuel security for the region and entered into a cost of service agreement with these two units for the period between June 1, 2022 - May 31, 2024. The agreement was approved by the FERC in December 2018.\nOn June 10, 2020, Generation filed a complaint with FERC against ISO-NE stating that ISO-NE failed to follow its tariff with respect to its evaluation of Mystic 8 and 9 for transmission security for the 2024 to 2025 Capacity Commitment Period (FCA 15) and that the modifications that ISO-NE made to its unfiled planning procedures to avoid retaining Mystic 8 and 9 should have been filed with FERC for approval. On August 17, 2020, FERC issued an order denying the complaint. As a result, on August 20, 2020, Exelon determined that Generation will permanently cease generation operations at Mystic 8 and 9 at the expiration of the cost of service commitment in May 2024. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters for additional discussion of Mystic\u2019s cost of service agreement.\nAs a result of the decision to early retire Mystic 8 and 9, Exelon and Generation recognized $22 million of one-time charges for the year ended December 31, 2020, related to materials and supplies inventory reserve adjustments, among other items. In addition, there are annual financial impacts stemming from shortening the expected economic useful life of Mystic 8 and 9 primarily related to accelerated depreciation of plant assets.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 7 - Early Plant Retirements\nExelon and Generation recorded incremental Depreciation and amortization expense of $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 12 - Asset Impairments for impairment assessment considerations of the New England Asset Group.\n8. Property, Plant, and Equipment (All Registrants)\nThe following tables present a summary of property, plant, and equipment by asset category as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n__________\n(a)Includes nuclear fuel that is in the fabrication and installation phase of $939 million and $1,025 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(b)Primarily composed of land and non-utility property.\n(c)Includes accumulated amortization of nuclear fuel in the reactor core at Generation of $2,774 million and $2,867 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 8 - Property, Plant, and Equipment\nThe following table presents the average service life for each asset category in number of years:\nDepreciation provisions are based on the estimated useful lives of the stations, which reflect the first renewal of the operating licenses for all of Generation's operating nuclear generating stations except for Clinton, Byron, Dresden, and Peach Bottom. Clinton depreciation provisions are based on an estimated useful life through 2027, which is the last year of the Illinois ZES. Peach Bottom depreciation provisions are based on estimated useful life of 2053 and 2054 for Unit 2 and Unit 3, respectively, which reflects the second renewal of its operating licenses. Beginning August 2020, Byron, Dresden, and Mystic depreciation provisions were based on their announced shutdown dates of September 2021, November 2021, and May 2024, respectively. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters for additional information regarding license renewals and the Illinois ZECs and Note 7 - Early Plant Retirements for additional information on the impacts of early plant retirements.\nThe following table presents the annual depreciation rates for each asset category. Nuclear fuel amortization is charged to fuel expense using the unit-of-production method and not included in the below table.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 8 - Property, Plant, and Equipment\nCapitalized Interest and AFUDC (All Registrants)\nThe following table summarizes capitalized interest and credits to AFUDC by year:\nSee Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies for additional information regarding property, plant and equipment policies. See Note 17 - Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information regarding Exelon\u2019s, ComEd\u2019s, PECO's, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE\u2019s property, plant and equipment subject to mortgage liens.\n9. Jointly Owned Electric Utility Plant (Exelon, Generation, PECO, DPL, and ACE)\nExelon's, Generation's, PECO's, DPL's, and ACE's material undivided ownership interests in jointly owned electric plants and transmission facilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n__________\n(a)PECO, DPL, and ACE own a 42.55%, 1%, and 13.9% share, respectively in 151.3 miles of 500kV lines located in New Jersey and of the Salem generating plant substation. PECO, DPL, and ACE also own a 42.55%, 7.45%, and 7.45% share, respectively, in 2.5 miles of 500kV line located over the Delaware River. ACE also has a 21.78% share in a 500kV New Freedom Switching substation.\nExelon\u2019s, Generation\u2019s, PECO's, DPL's, and ACE's undivided ownership interests are financed with their funds and all operations are accounted for as if such participating interests were wholly owned facilities. Exelon\u2019s, Generation\u2019s, PECO's, DPL's, and ACE's share of direct expenses of the jointly owned plants are included in Purchased power and fuel and Operating and maintenance expenses in Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and in Operating and maintenance expenses in PECO's, PHI's, DPL's, and ACE's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations\n10. Asset Retirement Obligations (All Registrants)\nNuclear Decommissioning Asset Retirement Obligations (Exelon and Generation)\nGeneration has a legal obligation to decommission its nuclear power plants following the expiration of their operating licenses. To estimate its decommissioning obligation related to its nuclear generating stations for financial accounting and reporting purposes, Generation uses a probability-weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit-by-unit basis, considers multiple outcome scenarios that include significant estimates and assumptions, and are based on decommissioning cost studies, cost escalation rates, probabilistic cash flow models, and discount rates. Generation updates its ARO annually unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates, based on its review of updated cost studies and its annual evaluation of cost escalation factors and probabilities assigned to various scenarios. Generation began decommissioning the TMI nuclear plant upon permanently ceasing operations in 2019. See below section for decommissioning of Zion Station.\nThe financial statement impact for changes in the ARO, on an individual unit basis, due to the changes in and timing of estimated cash flows generally result in a corresponding change in the unit\u2019s ARC within Property, plant, and equipment on Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the ARO decreases for a Non-Regulatory Agreement unit without any remaining ARC, the corresponding change is recorded as decrease in Operating and maintenance expense within Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the nuclear decommissioning ARO reflected in Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets, from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020:\n__________\n(a)Includes $80 million and $112 million as the current portion of the ARO at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which is included in Other current liabilities in Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe net $1,022 million increase in the ARO during 2020 for changes in the amounts and timing of estimated decommissioning cash flows was driven by multiple adjustments throughout the year. These adjustments primarily include:\n\u2022A net increase of approximately $800 million was driven by updates to Byron and Dresden reflecting changes in assumed retirement dates and assumed methods of decommissioning as a result of the announcement to early retire these plants in 2021. Refer to Note 7 - Early Plant Retirements for additional information.\n\u2022An increase of approximately $360 million resulting from the change in the assumed DOE spent fuel acceptance date for disposal from 2030 to 2035.\n\u2022A decrease of approximately $220 million due to lower estimated decommissioning costs primarily for Limerick and Peach Bottom nuclear units resulting from the completion of updated cost studies.\nThe 2020 ARO updates resulted in a increase of $60 million in Operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 within Exelon and Generation's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations\nThe net $864 million increase in the ARO during 2019 for changes in the amounts and timing of estimated decommissioning cash flows was driven by multiple adjustments throughout the year, some with offsetting impacts. These adjustments primarily include:\n\u2022An increase of approximately $780 million for changes in the assumed retirement timing probabilities for sites including certain economically challenged nuclear plants and the extension of Peach Bottom\u2019s operating life.\n\u2022An increase of approximately $490 million for other impacts that included updated cost escalation rates, primarily for labor, equipment and materials, and current discount rates.\n\u2022Lower estimated costs to decommission TMI, Nine Mile Point, Ginna, Braidwood, Byron, and LaSalle nuclear units of approximately $410 million resulting from the completion of updated cost studies.\nThe 2019 ARO updates resulted in a decrease of $150 million in Operating and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 within Exelon and Generation's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. See Note 7 - Early Plant Retirements for additional information regarding TMI and economically challenged nuclear plants and Note 3 - Regulatory Matters regarding the Peach Bottom second license renewal.\nNDT Funds\nNDT funds have been established for each generation station unit to satisfy Generation\u2019s nuclear decommissioning obligations. Generally, NDT funds established for a particular unit may not be used to fund the decommissioning obligations of any other unit.\nThe NDT funds associated with Generation's nuclear units have been funded with amounts collected from the previous owners and their respective utility customers. PECO is authorized to collect funds, in revenues, for decommissioning the former PECO nuclear plants through regulated rates, and these collections are scheduled through the operating lives of the former PECO plants. The amounts collected from PECO customers are remitted to Generation and deposited into the NDT funds for the unit for which funds are collected. Every five years, PECO files a rate adjustment with the PAPUC that reflects PECO\u2019s calculations of the estimated amount needed to decommission each of the former PECO units based on updated fund balances and estimated decommissioning costs. The rate adjustment is used to determine the amount collectible from PECO customers. On March 31, 2017, PECO filed its Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Adjustment with the PAPUC proposing an annual recovery from customers of approximately $4 million. This amount reflects a decrease from the previously approved annual collection of approximately $24 million primarily due to the removal of the collections for Limerick Units 1 and 2 as a result of the NRC approving the extension of the operating licenses for an additional 20 years. On August 8, 2017, the PAPUC approved the filing and the new rates became effective January 1, 2018.\nAny shortfall of funds necessary for decommissioning, determined for each generating station unit, is ultimately required to be funded by Generation, with the exception of a shortfall for the current decommissioning activities at Zion Station, where certain decommissioning activities have been transferred to a third-party (see Zion Station Decommissioning below) and the CENG units, where any shortfall is required to be funded by both Generation and EDF. Generation, through PECO, has recourse to collect additional amounts from PECO customers related to a shortfall of NDT funds for the former PECO units, subject to certain limitations and thresholds, as prescribed by an order from the PAPUC. Generally, PECO, and likewise Generation will not be allowed to collect amounts associated with the first $50 million of any shortfall of trust funds compared to decommissioning costs, as well as 5% of any additional shortfalls, on an aggregate basis for all former PECO units. The initial $50 million and up to 5% of any additional shortfalls would be borne by Generation. No recourse exists to collect additional amounts from utility customers for any of Generation's other nuclear units. With respect to the former ComEd and PECO units, any funds remaining in the NDTs after all decommissioning has been completed are required to be refunded to ComEd\u2019s or PECO\u2019s customers, subject to certain limitations that allow sharing of excess funds with Generation related to the former PECO units. With respect to Generation's other nuclear units, Generation retains any funds remaining after decommissioning. However, in connection with CENG's acquisition of the Nine Mile Point and Ginna plants and settlements with certain regulatory agencies, CENG is subject to certain conditions pertaining to NDT funds that, if met, could possibly result in obligations to make payments to certain third parties (clawbacks). For Nine Mile Point and Ginna, the clawback provisions are triggered only in the event\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations\nthat the required decommissioning activities are discontinued or not started or completed in a timely manner. In the event that the clawback provisions are triggered for Nine Mile Point, then, depending upon the triggering event, an amount equal to 50% of the total amount withdrawn from the funds for non-decommissioning activities or 50% of any excess funds in the trust funds above the amounts required for decommissioning (including spent fuel management and decommissioning) is to be paid to the Nine Mile Point sellers. In the event that the clawback provisions are triggered for Ginna, then an amount equal to any estimated cost savings realized by not completing any of the required decommissioning activities is to be paid to the Ginna sellers. Generation expects to comply with applicable regulations and timely commence and complete all required decommissioning activities.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, Exelon and Generation had NDT funds totaling $14,599 million and $13,353 million, respectively. The NDT funds include $134 million and $163 million for the current portion of the NDT at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are included in Other current assets in Exelon's and Generation's Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 24 - Supplemental Financial Information for additional information on activities of the NDT funds.\nAccounting Implications of the Regulatory Agreements with ComEd and PECO\nBased on the regulatory agreements with the ICC and PAPUC that dictate Generation\u2019s obligations related to the shortfall or excess of NDT funds necessary for decommissioning the former ComEd units on a unit-by-unit basis and the former PECO units in total, decommissioning-related activities net of applicable taxes, including realized and unrealized gains and losses on the NDT funds, depreciation of the ARC, and accretion of the decommissioning obligation, are generally offset within Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and are recorded by Generation and the corresponding regulated utility as a component of the intercompany and regulatory balances on the balance sheet. For the purposes of making this determination, the decommissioning obligation referred to is different, as described below, from the calculation used in the NRC minimum funding obligation filings based on NRC guidelines.\nFor the former PECO units, given the symmetric settlement provisions that allow for continued recovery of decommissioning costs from PECO customers in the event of a shortfall and the obligation for Generation to ultimately return any excess funds to PECO customers (on an aggregate basis for all seven units), decommissioning-related activities are generally offset within Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income regardless of whether the NDT funds are expected to exceed or fall short of the total estimated decommissioning obligation. The offset of decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income results in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payables or noncurrent receivables to affiliates at Generation with PECO recording an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from or payable to Generation and a corresponding regulatory liability or regulatory asset. Any changes to the existing PECO regulatory agreements could impact Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s ability to offset decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income, and the impact to Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s financial statements could be material.\nFor the former ComEd units, given no further recovery from ComEd customers is permitted and Generation retains an obligation to ultimately return any unused NDTs to ComEd customers (on a unit-by-unit basis), to the extent the related NDT investment balances are expected to exceed the total estimated decommissioning obligation for each unit, the offset of decommissioning-related activities within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income results with Generation recognizing an intercompany payable to ComEd while ComEd records an intercompany receivable from Generation with a corresponding regulatory liability. However, given the asymmetric settlement provision that does not allow for continued recovery from ComEd customers in the event of a shortfall, recognition of a regulatory asset at ComEd is not permissible and accounting for decommissioning-related activities at Generation for that unit would not be offset, and the impact to Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income could be material during such periods.\nAs of December 31, 2020, decommissioning-related activities for all of the former ComEd units, except for Zion (see Zion Station Decommissioning below), are currently offset within Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations\nThe decommissioning-related activities related to the Non-Regulatory Agreement Units are reflected in Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nSee Note 3 - Regulatory Matters and Note 25 - Related Party Transactions for additional information regarding regulatory liabilities at ComEd and PECO and intercompany balances between Generation, ComEd, and PECO reflecting the obligation to refund to customers any decommissioning-related assets in excess of the related decommissioning obligations.\nZion Station Decommissioning\nIn 2010, Generation completed an ASA under which ZionSolutions assumed responsibility for decommissioning Zion Station and Generation transferred to ZionSolutions substantially all the Zion Station\u2019s assets, including the related NDT funds.\nFollowing ZionSolutions' completion of its contractual obligations and transfer of the NRC license to Generation, Generation will store the SNF at Zion Station until it is transferred to the DOE for ultimate disposal, and will complete all remaining decommissioning activities associated with the SNF dry storage facility.\nGeneration had retained its obligation for the SNF as well as certain NDT assets to fund its obligation to maintain the SNF at Zion Station until transfer to the DOE and to complete all remaining decommissioning activities for the SNF storage facility. Any shortage of funds necessary to maintain the SNF and decommission the SNF storage facility is ultimately required to be funded by Generation. As of December 31, 2020, the ARO associated with Zion's SNF storage facility is $175 million and the NDT funds available to fund this obligation are $66 million.\nNRC Minimum Funding Requirements\nNRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in specified minimum amounts to decommission the facility at the end of its life. The estimated decommissioning obligations as calculated using the NRC methodology differ from the ARO recorded in Generation\u2019s and Exelon\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets primarily due to differences in the type of costs included in the estimates, the basis for estimating such costs, and assumptions regarding the decommissioning alternatives to be used, potential license renewals, decommissioning cost escalation, and the growth rate in the NDT funds. Under NRC regulations, if the minimum funding requirements calculated under the NRC methodology are less than the future value of the NDT funds, also calculated under the NRC methodology, then the NRC requires either further funding or other financial guarantees.\nKey assumptions used in the minimum funding calculation using the NRC methodology at December 31, 2020 include: (1) consideration of costs only for the removal of radiological contamination at each unit; (2) the option on a unit-by-unit basis to use generic, non-site specific cost estimates; (3) consideration of only one decommissioning scenario for each unit; (4) the plants cease operation at the end of their current license lives (with no assumed license renewals for those units that have not already received renewals); (5) the assumption of current nominal dollar cost estimates that are neither escalated through the anticipated period of decommissioning, nor discounted using the CARFR; and (6) assumed annual after-tax returns on the NDT funds of 2% (3% for the former PECO units, as specified by the PAPUC).\nIn contrast, the key criteria and assumptions used by Generation to determine the ARO and to forecast the target growth in the NDT funds at December 31, 2020 include: (1) the use of site specific cost estimates that are updated at least once every five years; (2) the inclusion in the ARO estimate of all legally unavoidable costs required to decommission the unit (e.g., radiological decommissioning and full site restoration for certain units, on-site spent fuel maintenance and storage subsequent to ceasing operations and until DOE acceptance, and disposal of certain LLRW); (3) the consideration of multiple scenarios where decommissioning and site restoration activities, as applicable, are completed under possible scenarios ranging from 10 to 70 years after the cessation of plant operations; (4) the consideration of multiple end of life scenarios; (5) the measurement of the obligation at the present value of the future estimated costs and an annual average accretion of the ARO of approximately 4% through a period of approximately 30 years after the end of the extended lives of the units; and (6) an estimated targeted annual pre-tax return on the NDT funds of 5.6% to 6.1% (as compared to a historical 5-year annual average pre-tax return of approximately 9.0%).\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations\nGeneration is required to provide to the NRC a biennial report by unit (annually for units that have been retired or are within five years of the current approved license life), based on values as of December 31, addressing Generation\u2019s ability to meet the NRC minimum funding levels. Depending on the value of the trust funds, Generation may be required to take steps, such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional contributions to the trusts, which could be significant, to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded and that NRC minimum funding requirements are met. As a result, Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s cash flows and financial positions may be significantly adversely affected.\nGeneration filed its biennial decommissioning funding status report with the NRC on April 1, 2019 for all units, including its shutdown units, except for Zion Station which is included in a separate report to the NRC submitted by ZionSolutions, LLC. The status report demonstrated adequate decommissioning funding assurance as of December 31, 2018 for all units except for Clinton and Peach Bottom Unit 1. As of February 28, 2019, Clinton demonstrated adequate minimum funding assurance due to market recovery and no further action is required. This demonstration was also included in the April 1, 2019 submittal. On March 31, 2020, Generation filed its annual decommissioning funding status report with the NRC for Generation\u2019s shutdown units (excluding Zion Station for the reason noted above). The annual status report demonstrated adequate decommissioning funding assurance as of December 31, 2019, for all of its shutdown reactors except for Peach Bottom Unit 1. As a former PECO plant, financial assurance for decommissioning Peach Bottom Unit 1 is provided by the NDT fund, collections from PECO ratepayers, and the ability to adjust those collections in accordance with the approved PAPUC tariff. No additional actions are required aside from the PAPUC filing in accordance with the tariff.\nGeneration will file its next decommissioning funding status report with the NRC by March 31, 2021. This report will reflect the status of decommissioning funding assurance as of December 31, 2020 and will include the 2021 early retirements of Byron and Dresden. A shortfall could require Exelon to post parental guarantee for Generation\u2019s share of the funding assurance. However, the amount of any required guarantee will ultimately depend on the decommissioning approach adopted at Byron and Dresden, the associated level of costs, and the decommissioning trust fund investment performance going forward.\nAs the future values of trust funds change due to market conditions, the NRC minimum funding status of Generation\u2019s units will change. In addition, if changes occur to the regulatory agreement with the PAPUC that currently allows amounts to be collected from PECO customers for decommissioning the former PECO units, the NRC minimum funding status of those plants could change at subsequent NRC filing dates.\nNon-Nuclear Asset Retirement Obligations (All Registrants)\nGeneration has AROs for plant closure costs associated with its fossil and renewable generating facilities, including asbestos abatement, removal of certain storage tanks, restoring leased land to the condition it was in prior to construction of renewable generating stations and other decommissioning-related activities. The Utility Registrants have AROs primarily associated with the abatement and disposal of equipment and buildings contaminated with asbestos and PCBs. See Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on the Registrants\u2019 accounting policy for AROs.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations\nThe following table provides a rollforward of the non-nuclear AROs reflected in the Registrants\u2019 Consolidated Balance Sheets from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020:\n__________\n(a)For ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, and DPL, the majority of the accretion is recorded as an increase to a regulatory asset due to the associated regulatory treatment.\n(b)Represents AROs related to Generation's solar business, which were classified as held for sale as a result of the sale agreement. See Note 2 - Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions for additional information.\n11. Leases (All Registrants)\nLessee\nThe Registrants have operating and finance leases for which they are the lessees. The following tables outline the significant types of leases at each registrant and other terms and conditions of the lease agreements as of December 31, 2020. Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PECO, and BGE did not have material finance leases in 2020 or in 2019. PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE also did not have material finance leases in 2019.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 11 - Leases\nThe components of operating lease costs were as follows:\n__________\n(a)Excludes $48 million, $44 million, $4 million, and $4 million of sublease income recorded at Exelon, Generation, PHI, and DPL, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $51 million, $44 million, $7 million, and $7 million of sublease income recorded at Exelon, Generation, PHI, and DPL, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nPHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE recorded finance lease costs of $9 million, $3 million, $4 million, and $2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following table presents the Registrants' rental expense under the prior lease accounting guidance for the year ended December 31, 2018:\n__________\n(a)Includes contingent operating lease payments associated with contracted generation agreements that are not included in the minimum future operating lease payments table. Payments made under Generation's contracted generation lease agreements totaled $493 million.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 11 - Leases\nThe following tables provide additional information regarding the presentation of operating and finance lease ROU assets and lease liabilities within the Registrants\u2019 Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n__________\n(a)Exelon's and Generation's operating ROU assets and lease liabilities include $387 million and $528 million, respectively, related to contracted generation as of December 31, 2020, and $515 million and $664 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.\nThe weighted average remaining lease terms, in years, for operating and finance leases were as follows:\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 11 - Leases\nThe weighted average discount rates for operating and finance leases were as follows:\nFuture minimum lease payments for operating and finance leases as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating and finance lease liabilities were as follows:\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 11 - Leases\nROU assets obtained in exchange for operating and finance lease obligations were as follows:\nLessor\nThe Registrants have operating leases for which they are the lessors.

Asset Impairments (Exelon and Generation)\nThe Registrants evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment may include a deteriorating business climate, including, but not limited to, declines in energy prices, condition of the asset, specific regulatory disallowance, or plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life. The Registrants determine if long-lived assets or asset groups are impaired by comparing the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value. When the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates a long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group over its fair value. The fair value analysis is primarily based on the income approach using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) including revenue and generation forecasts, projected capital and maintenance expenditures and discount rates. A variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the recoverability of an asset or asset group and, thus, could potentially result in material future impairments of the Registrant's long-lived assets.\nAntelope Valley Solar Facility\nGeneration\u2019s Antelope Valley, a 242 MW solar facility in Lancaster, CA, sells all of its output to PG&E through a PPA. As a result of the PG&E bankruptcy filing in the first quarter of 2019, Generation completed a comprehensive review of Antelope Valley's estimated undiscounted future cash flows and no impairment charge was recorded.\nThe United States Bankruptcy Court entered an order on June 20, 2020 confirming PG&E\u2019s plan of reorganization. On July 1, 2020 the plan became effective, and PG&E emerged from bankruptcy. Under the confirmed plan, PG&E will continue to honor the existing PPA agreement with Antelope Valley.\nSee Note 17 - Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information.\nNew England Asset Group\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Mystic Unit 9 did not clear in the ISO-NE capacity auction for the 2021 - 2022 planning year. On March 29, 2018, Generation notified grid operator ISO-NE of its plans to early retire its Mystic Units 8 and 9 absent regulatory reforms on June 1, 2022. These events suggested that the carrying value of the New England asset group may be impaired. In the first quarter of 2018, Generation completed a comprehensive review of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the New England asset group and no impairment charge was required.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, in conjunction with the retirement announcement of Mystic Units 8 and 9, Generation completed a comprehensive review of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the New England asset group and concluded that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows and fair value of the New England asset group were less than their carrying values. As a result, a pre-tax impairment charge of $500 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2020 within Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. See Note 7 - Early Plant Retirements for additional information.\nMidwest Asset Group\nIn the third quarter of 2020, in conjunction with the retirement announcements of the Byron and Dresden nuclear plants, Generation completed a comprehensive review of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the Midwest asset group and no impairment charge was required.\nGeneration will continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of the Midwest asset group as certain other nuclear plants in Illinois are also showing increased signs of economic distress, which could lead to an early retirement. See Note 7 - Early Plant Retirements for additional information.\nEquity Method Investments in Certain Distributed Energy Companies\nIn the third quarter of 2019, Generation\u2019s equity method investments in certain distributed energy companies were fully impaired due to an other-than-temporary decline in market conditions and underperforming projects.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 12 - Asset Impairments\nExelon and Generation recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $164 million in Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates and an offsetting pre-tax $96 million in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. As a result, Generation accelerated the amortization of investment tax credits associated with these companies and Exelon and Generation recorded a benefit of $46 million in Income taxes. The impairment charge and the accelerated amortization of investment tax credits resulted in a net $15 million decrease to Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s earnings. See Note 23 - Variable Interest Entities for additional information.\n13. Intangible Assets (Exelon, Generation, ComEd, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE)\nGoodwill\nThe following table presents the gross amount, accumulated impairment loss, and carrying amount of goodwill at Exelon, ComEd, and PHI as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. There were no additions or impairments during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n__________\n(a)Reflects goodwill recorded in 2000 from the PECO/Unicom merger (predecessor parent company of ComEd).\n(b)Reflects goodwill recorded in 2016 from the PHI merger.\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an assessment for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of ComEd's and PHI's reporting units below their carrying amounts. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (known as a component) and is the level at which goodwill is assessed for impairment. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and its operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. ComEd has a single operating segment. PHI's operating segments are Pepco, DPL, and ACE. See Note 5 - Segment Information for additional information. There is no level below these operating segments for which operating results are regularly reviewed by segment management. Therefore, the ComEd, Pepco, DPL, and ACE operating segments are also considered reporting units for goodwill impairment assessment purposes. Exelon's and ComEd's $2.6 billion of goodwill has been assigned entirely to the ComEd reporting unit, while Exelon's and PHI's $4.0 billion of goodwill has been assigned to the Pepco, DPL, and ACE reporting units in the amounts of $2.1 billion, $1.4 billion, and $0.5 billion, respectively.\nEntities assessing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary. As part of the qualitative assessments, Exelon, ComEd, and PHI evaluate, among other things, management's best estimate of projected operating and capital cash flows for their businesses, outcomes of recent regulatory proceedings, changes in certain market conditions, including the discount rate and regulated utility peer EBITDA multiples, and the passing margin from their last quantitative assessments performed. If an entity bypasses the qualitative assessment, a quantitative, fair value-based assessment is performed, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the entity recognizes an impairment charge, which is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment assessment requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit, which management estimates using a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd's, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's businesses, and the fair value of debt.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 13 - Intangible Assets\n2020 and 2019 Goodwill Impairment Assessment. ComEd and PHI qualitatively determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of their reporting units exceeded their carrying values and, therefore, did not perform quantitative assessments as of November 1, 2020 and 2019 for ComEd and PHI. The last quantitative assessments performed were as of November 1, 2016 for ComEd and November 1, 2018 for PHI.\nWhile the annual assessments indicated no impairments, certain assumptions used to estimate reporting unit fair values are highly sensitive to changes. Adverse regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon's, ComEd's, and PHI\u2019s goodwill, which could be material.\nOther Intangible Assets and Liabilities\nExelon\u2019s, Generation\u2019s, ComEd\u2019s, and PHI's other intangible assets and liabilities, included in Unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities and Other deferred debits and other assets in their Consolidated Balance Sheets, consisted of the following as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The intangible assets and liabilities shown below are amortized on a straight line basis, except for unamortized energy contracts which are amortized in relation to the expected realization of the underlying cash flows:\nThe following table summarizes the amortization expense related to intangible assets and liabilities for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\n__________\n(a)At Exelon and Generation, amortization of unamortized energy contracts totaling $30 million, $21 million, and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, was recorded in Operating revenues or Purchased power and fuel expense in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n(b)At Exelon and PHI, amortization of the unamortized energy contract fair value adjustment amounts and the corresponding offsetting regulatory asset and liability amounts are amortized through Purchased power and fuel expense in their Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020:\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 13 - Intangible Assets\nRenewable Energy Credits (Exelon and Generation)\nExelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s RECs are included in Other current assets and Other deferred debits and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Purchased RECs are recorded at cost on the date they are purchased. The cost of RECs purchased on a stand-alone basis is based on the transaction price, while the cost of RECs acquired through PPAs represents the difference between the total contract price and the market price of energy at contract inception. Generally, revenue for RECs that are sold to a counterparty under a contract that specifically identifies a power plant is recognized at a point in time when the power is produced. This includes both bundled and unbundled REC sales. Otherwise, the revenue is recognized upon physical transfer of the REC to the customer.\nThe following table presents the current and noncurrent RECs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n14. Income Taxes (All Registrants)\nComponents of Income Tax Expense or Benefit\nIncome tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations is comprised of the following components:\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 - Income Taxes\nRate Reconciliation\nThe effective income tax rate from continuing operations varies from the U.S. federal statutory rate principally due to the following:\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 - Income Taxes\n__________\n(a)Positive percentages represent income tax expense. Negative percentages represent income tax benefit.\n(b)At ComEd, the higher effective tax rate is primarily related to the nondeductible Deferred Prosecution Agreement payments. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional information.\n(c)At PECO, the negative effective tax rate is primarily related to an increase in plant basis differences attributable to tax repair deductions related to an increase in storms and qualifying projects.\n(d)At BGE, the lower effective tax rate, and at PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE, the negative effective tax rate is primarily attributable to accelerated amortization of transmission related income tax regulatory liabilities as a result of regulatory settlements. See Note 3 - Regulatory Matters for additional information.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 - Income Taxes\nTax Differences and Carryforwards\nThe tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards, which give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets (liabilities), as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are presented below:\n__________\n(a)Does not include unamortized investment tax credits reclassified to liabilities held for sale.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 - Income Taxes\nThe following table provides Exelon\u2019s, Generation\u2019s, PECO\u2019s, BGE\u2019s, PHI\u2019s, Pepco\u2019s, DPL\u2019s, and ACE\u2019s carryforwards, which are presented on a post-apportioned basis, and any corresponding valuation allowances as of December 31, 2020. ComEd does not have net operating losses or credit carryforwards for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n__________\n(a)Generation's state net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in 2029. PECO's Pennsylvania charitable contribution carryforwards and BGE's Maryland charitable deduction and capital loss carryforwards will begin expiring in 2021. ACE's New Jersey tax credit carryforward has an indefinite carryforward period. These amounts are not material.\nTabular Reconciliation of Unrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe following table presents changes in unrecognized tax benefits, by Registrant.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 - Income Taxes\n__________\n(a)Exelon, Generation, BGE, PHI, Pepco, and DPL decreased their unrecognized state tax benefits primarily due to the receipt of favorable guidance with respect to the deductibility of certain depreciable fixed assets. The recognition of the tax benefits related to BGE, PHI, Pepco, and DPL was offset by corresponding regulatory liabilities and that portion had no immediate impact to their effective tax rate.\n(b)Exelon's and Generation's unrecognized federal and state tax benefits decreased in the first quarter of 2020 by approximately $411 million due to the settlement of a federal refund claim with IRS Appeals. The recognition of these tax benefits resulted in an increase to Exelon's and Generation\u2019s net income of $76 million and $73 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2020, reflecting a decrease to Exelon's and Generation's income tax expense of $67 million.\nLike-Kind Exchange\nIn 2016, the Tax Court held that Exelon was not entitled to defer a gain on its 1999 like-kind exchange transaction. In addition to the tax and interest related to the gain deferral, the Tax Court also ruled that Exelon was liable for penalties and interest on the penalties. Exelon had fully paid the amounts assessed resulting from the Tax Court decision in 2017. In September 2017, Exelon appealed the Tax Court decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. In October 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 - Income Taxes\nTax Court\u2019s decision. Exelon filed a petition seeking rehearing of the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision, but the Seventh Circuit denied that petition in December 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, Exelon elected not to seek a further review by the U.S. Supreme Court. As a result, Exelon's and ComEd's unrecognized tax benefits decreased by approximately $33 million and $2 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2019.\nRecognition of unrecognized tax benefits\nThe following table presents Exelon's, Generation's, and PHI's unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate. ComEd's, PECO's, BGE's, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's amounts are not material.\n__________\n(a)PHI has $21 million of unrecognized state tax benefits that, if recognized, $14 million would be in the form of a net operating loss carryforward, which is expected to require a full valuation allowance based on present circumstances.\nACE has $14 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 that, if recognized, may be included in future base rates and that portion would have no impact on the effective tax rate. Exelon's, Generation's, ComEd's, PECO's, BGE's, PHI's, Pepco's, and DPL's amounts are not material.\nReasonably possible the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or decrease within 12 months after the reporting date\nAs of December 31, 2020, ACE has approximately $14 million of unrecognized state tax benefits that could significantly decrease within the 12 months after the reporting date based on the outcome of pending court cases involving other taxpayers. The unrecognized tax benefit, if recognized, may be included in future base rates and that portion would have no impact to the effective tax rate.\nTotal amounts of interest and penalties recognized\nThe following table represents the net interest and penalties receivable (payable) related to tax positions reflected in Exelon's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generation's and the Utility Registrants' amounts are not material.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 - Income Taxes\nThe Registrants did not record material interest and penalty expense related to tax positions reflected in their Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest expense and penalty expense are recorded in Interest expense, net and Other, net, respectively, in Other income and deductions in the Registrants' Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nDescription of tax years open to assessment by major jurisdiction\n__________\n(a)Certain registrants are only open to assessment for tax years since joining the Exelon federal consolidated group; BGE beginning in 2012 and PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE beginning in 2016.\nOther Tax Matters\nLong-Term Marginal State Income Tax Rate (All Registrants)\nQuarterly, Exelon reviews and updates its marginal state income tax rates for changes in state apportionment. The Registrants remeasure their existing deferred income tax balances to reflect the changes in marginal rates, which results in either an increase or a decrease to their net deferred income tax liability balances. Utility Registrants record corresponding regulatory liabilities or assets to the extent such amounts are probable of settlement or recovery through customer rates and an adjustment to income tax expense for all other amounts. The impacts to the Utility Registrants for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were not material.\nAllocation of Tax Benefits (All Registrants)\nGeneration and the Utility Registrants are all party to an agreement with Exelon and other subsidiaries of Exelon that provides for the allocation of consolidated tax liabilities and benefits (Tax Sharing Agreement). The Tax Sharing Agreement provides that each party is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be owed had the party been separately subject to tax. In addition, any net federal and state benefits attributable to Exelon is reallocated to the other Registrants. That allocation is treated as a contribution to the capital of the party receiving the benefit.\nThe following table presents the allocation of tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 14 - Income Taxes\n__________\n(a)BGE did not record an allocation of federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement as a result of a tax net operating loss.\n(b)ACE did not record an allocation of federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement as a result of a tax net operating loss.\n(c)Pepco, DPL, and ACE did not record an allocation of federal tax benefits from Exelon under the Tax Sharing Agreement as a result of a tax net operating loss.\nResearch and Development Activities\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Exelon and Generation recognized additional tax benefits related to certain research and development activities that qualify for federal and state tax incentives for the 2010 through 2018 tax years, which resulted in an increase to Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s net income of $108 million and $75 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting a decrease to Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Income tax expense of $97 million and $66 million, respectively.\n15. Retirement Benefits (All Registrants)\nExelon sponsors defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans for essentially all current employees. Substantially all non-union employees and electing union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 participate in cash balance pension plans. Effective January 1, 2009, substantially all newly-hired union-represented employees participate in cash balance pension plans. Effective February 1, 2018 for most newly-hired Generation and BSC non-represented, non-craft, employees and January 1, 2021 for most newly-hired utility management employees, these newly-hired employees are not eligible for pension benefits, and will instead be eligible to receive an enhanced non-discretionary employer contribution in an Exelon defined contribution savings plan. Effective January 1, 2018, most newly-hired non-represented, non-craft, employees are not eligible for OPEB benefits and employees represented by Local 614 are not eligible for retiree health care benefits. Effective January 1, 2021, most non-represented, non-craft, employees who are under the age of 40 are not eligible for retiree health care benefits.\nEffective January 1, 2019, Exelon merged the Exelon Corporation Cash Balance Pension Plan (CBPP) into the Exelon Corporation Retirement Program (ECRP). The merging of the plans did not change the benefits offered to the plan participants and, thus, had no impact on Exelon's pension obligation. However, beginning in 2019, actuarial losses and gains related to the CBPP and ECRP are amortized over participants\u2019 average remaining service period of the merged ECRP rather than each individual plan.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 - Retirement Benefits\nThe table below shows the pension and OPEB plans in which employees of each operating company participated at December 31, 2020:\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 - Retirement Benefits\n__________\n(a)These plans are collectively referred to as the legacy Exelon plans.\n(b)These plans are collectively referred to as the legacy Constellation Energy Group (CEG) Plans.\n(c)These plans are collectively referred to as the legacy CENG plans.\n(d)These plans are collectively referred to as the legacy PHI plans.\n(e)Employees generally remain in their legacy benefit plans when transferring between operating companies.\nExelon\u2019s traditional and cash balance pension plans are intended to be tax-qualified defined benefit plans. Exelon has elected that the trusts underlying these plans be treated as qualified trusts under the IRC. If certain conditions are met, Exelon can deduct payments made to the qualified trusts, subject to certain IRC limitations.\nBenefit Obligations, Plan Assets, and Funded Status\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, Exelon received an updated valuation of its pension and OPEB to reflect actual census data as of January 1, 2020. This valuation resulted in an increase to the pension and OPEB obligations of $8 million and $31 million, respectively. Additionally, accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by $7 million (after-tax) and regulatory assets and liabilities increased by $19 million and decreased by $10 million, respectively.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 - Retirement Benefits\nThe following tables provide a rollforward of the changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets of Exelon for the most recent two years for all plans combined:\n__________\n(a)The pension and OPEB actuarial losses in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflect a decrease in the discount rate. OPEB losses in 2020 were offset by gains related to plan changes.\nExelon presents its benefit obligations and plan assets net on its balance sheet within the following line items:\nThe following table provides the ABO and fair value of plan assets for all pension plans with an ABO in excess of plan assets. Information for pension and OPEB plans with projected benefit obligations (PBO) and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO), respectively, in excess of plan assets has been disclosed in the Obligations and Plan Assets table above as all pension and OPEB plans are underfunded.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 - Retirement Benefits\nComponents of Net Periodic Benefit Costs\nThe majority of the 2020 pension benefit cost for the Exelon-sponsored plans is calculated using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.00% and a discount rate of 3.34%. The majority of the 2020 OPEB cost is calculated using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.69% for funded plans and a discount rate of 3.31%.\nA portion of the net periodic benefit cost for all plans is capitalized within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table presents the components of Exelon\u2019s net periodic benefit costs, prior to capitalization, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nCost Allocation to Exelon Subsidiaries\nAll Registrants account for their participation in Exelon\u2019s pension and OPEB plans by applying multi-employer accounting. Exelon allocates costs related to its pension and OPEB plans to its subsidiaries based on both active and retired employee participation in each plan.\nThe amounts below represent the Registrants' allocated pension and OPEB costs. For Exelon, the service cost component is included in Operating and maintenance expense and Property, plant, and equipment, net while the non-service cost components are included in Other, net and Regulatory assets. For Generation and the Utility Registrants, the service cost and non-service cost components are included in Operating and maintenance expense and Property, plant, and equipment, net in their consolidated financial statements.\nComponents of AOCI and Regulatory Assets\nExelon recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability on its balance sheet, with offsetting entries to AOCI and regulatory assets (liabilities). A portion of current year actuarial (gains) losses and prior service costs (credits) is capitalized within Exelon\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect the expected regulatory recovery of these amounts, which would otherwise be recorded to AOCI. The following tables provide the components of AOCI and regulatory assets (liabilities) for Exelon for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 for all plans combined.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 - Retirement Benefits\nThe following table provides the components of gross accumulated other comprehensive loss and regulatory assets (liabilities) for Exelon that have not been recognized as components of periodic benefit cost at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for all plans combined:\nAverage Remaining Service Period\nFor pension benefits, Exelon amortizes its unrecognized prior service costs (credits) and certain actuarial (gains) losses, as applicable, based on participants\u2019 average remaining service periods.\nFor OPEB, Exelon amortizes its unrecognized prior service costs (credits) over participants\u2019 average remaining service period to benefit eligibility age and amortizes certain actuarial (gains) losses over participants\u2019 average remaining service period to expected retirement. The resulting average remaining service periods for pension and OPEB were as follows:\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 - Retirement Benefits\nAssumptions\nThe measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing benefits under Exelon\u2019s defined benefit and OPEB plans involves various factors, including the development of valuation assumptions and inputs and accounting policy elections. The measurement of benefit obligations and costs is impacted by several assumptions and inputs, as shown below, among other factors. When developing the required assumptions, Exelon considers historical information as well as future expectations.\nExpected Rate of Return. In determining the EROA, Exelon considers historical economic indicators (including inflation and GDP growth) that impact asset returns, as well as expectations regarding future long-term capital market performance, weighted by Exelon\u2019s target asset class allocations.\nMortality. The mortality assumption is composed of a base table that represents the current expectation of life expectancy of the population adjusted by an improvement scale that attempts to anticipate future improvements in life expectancy. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Exelon\u2019s mortality assumption utilizes the SOA 2019 base table (Pri-2012) and MP-2020 improvement scale adjusted to use Proxy SSA ultimate improvement rates. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Exelon's mortality assumption utilizes the SOA 2019 base table (Pri-2012) and MP-2019 improvement scale adjusted to a 0.75% long-term rate reached in 2035.\nFor Exelon, the following assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligations for the plans at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Assumptions used to determine year-end benefit obligations are the assumptions used to estimate the subsequent year\u2019s net periodic benefit costs.\n__________\n(a)The discount rates above represent the blended rates used to determine the majority of Exelon\u2019s pension and OPEB obligations. Certain benefit plans used individual rates, which range from 2.11% - 2.73% and 2.45% - 2.63% for pension and OPEB plans, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and 3.02% - 3.44% and 3.27% - 3.40% for pension and OPEB plans, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.\n(b)The investment crediting rate above represents a weighted average rate.\n(c)3.25% through 2019 and 3.75% thereafter.\nThe following assumptions were used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for Exelon for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 - Retirement Benefits\n__________\n(a)The discount rates above represent the blended rates used to establish the majority of Exelon\u2019s pension and OPEB costs. Certain benefit plans used individual rates, which range from 3.02%-3.44% and 3.27%-3.40% for pension and OPEB plans, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020; 4.13%-4.36% and 4.27%-4.38% for pension and OPEB plans; respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019; and 3.49%-3.65% and 3.57%-3.68% for pension and OPEB plans, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n(b)The investment crediting rate above represents a weighted average rate.\n(c)Not applicable to pension and OPEB plans that do not have plan assets.\n(d)3.25% through 2019 and 3.75% thereafter.\nContributions\nExelon allocates contributions related to its legacy Exelon pension and OPEB plans to its subsidiaries based on accounting cost. For legacy CEG, CENG, FitzPatrick, and PHI plans, pension and OPEB contributions are allocated to the subsidiaries based on employee participation (both active and retired). The following tables provide contributions to the pension and OPEB plans:\nManagement considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including actuarially determined minimum contribution requirements under ERISA, contributions required to avoid benefit restrictions and at-risk status as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act), management of the pension obligation, and regulatory implications. The Act requires the attainment of certain funding levels to avoid benefit restrictions (such as an inability to pay lump sums or to accrue benefits prospectively), and at-risk status (which triggers higher minimum contribution requirements and participant notification). The projected contributions below reflect a funding strategy to make levelized annual contributions with the objective of achieving 100% funded status on an ABO basis over time. This level funding strategy helps minimize volatility of future period required pension contributions. Based on this funding strategy and current market conditions, which are subject to change,\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 - Retirement Benefits\nExelon\u2019s estimated annual qualified pension contributions will be approximately $500 million in 2021. Unlike the qualified pension plans, Exelon\u2019s non-qualified pension plans are not funded, given that they are not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements.\nWhile OPEB plans are also not subject to statutory minimum contribution requirements, Exelon does fund certain of its plans. For Exelon's funded OPEB plans, contributions generally equal accounting costs, however, Exelon\u2019s management has historically considered several factors in determining the level of contributions to its OPEB plans, including liabilities management, levels of benefit claims paid, and regulatory implications (amounts deemed prudent to meet regulatory expectations and best assure continued rate recovery). The amounts below include benefit payments related to unfunded plans.\nThe following table provides all Registrants' planned contributions to the qualified pension plans, planned benefit payments to non-qualified pension plans, and planned contributions to OPEB plans in 2021:\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments\nEstimated future benefit payments to participants in all of the pension plans and postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2020 were:\nPlan Assets\nInvestment Strategy. On a regular basis, Exelon evaluates its investment strategy to ensure that plan assets will be sufficient to pay plan benefits when due. As part of this ongoing evaluation, Exelon may make changes to its targeted asset allocation and investment strategy.\nExelon has developed and implemented a liability hedging investment strategy for its qualified pension plans that has reduced the volatility of its pension assets relative to its pension liabilities. Exelon is likely to continue to gradually increase the liability hedging portfolio as the funded status of its plans improves. The overall objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns that will balance the liquidity requirements of the plans\u2019 liabilities while striving to minimize the risk of significant losses. Trust assets for Exelon\u2019s OPEB plans are managed in a diversified investment strategy that prioritizes maximizing liquidity and returns while minimizing asset volatility.\nActual asset returns have an impact on the costs reported for the Exelon-sponsored pension and OPEB plans. The actual asset returns across Exelon\u2019s pension and OPEB plans for the year ended December 31, 2020 were 14.45% and 9.14%, respectively, compared to an expected long-term return assumption of 7.00% and 6.69%,\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 - Retirement Benefits\nrespectively. Exelon used an EROA of 7.00% and 6.46% to estimate its 2021 pension and OPEB costs, respectively.\nExelon\u2019s pension and OPEB plan target asset allocations at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n__________\n(a)Alternative investments include private equity, hedge funds, real estate, and private credit.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk. Exelon evaluated its pension and OPEB plans\u2019 asset portfolios for the existence of significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2020. Types of concentrations that were evaluated include, but are not limited to, investment concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, foreign country, and individual fund. As of December 31, 2020, there were no significant concentrations (defined as greater than 10% of plan assets) of risk in Exelon\u2019s pension and OPEB plan assets.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 - Retirement Benefits\nFair Value Measurements\nThe following tables present pension and OPEB plan assets measured and recorded at fair value in Exelon's Consolidated Balance Sheets on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n__________\n(a)See Note 18-Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities for a description of levels within the fair value hierarchy.\n(b)Includes derivative instruments of $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, which have total notional amounts of $6,879 million and $6,668 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The notional principal\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 - Retirement Benefits\namounts for these instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of the fiscal years ended and do not represent the amount of the company\u2019s exposure to credit or market loss.\n(c)Includes investments in equities sold short held in investment vehicles primarily to hedge the equity option component of its convertible debt. Pension equities sold short totaled $(96) million and $(75) million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. OPEB equities sold short totaled $(42) million and $(35) million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(d)Excludes net liabilities of $132 million and $120 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which include certain derivative assets that have notional amounts of $239 million and $632 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These items are required to reconcile to the fair value of net plan assets and consist primarily of receivables or payables related to pending securities sales and purchases and interest and dividends receivable.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of Level 3 assets and liabilities for Exelon measured at fair value for pension and OPEB plans for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n__________\n(a)Represents cash settlements only.\n(b)In 2020, a contract was terminated for a certain fixed income commingled fund resulting in the ownership of certain fixed income securities which led to a transfer into Level 3 from not subject to leveling of $299 million.\nValuation Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value\nThe techniques used to fair value the pension and OPEB assets invested in cash equivalents, equities, fixed income, derivatives, private equity, real estate, and private credit investments are the same as the valuation techniques for these types of investments in NDTFs. See Cash Equivalents and NDT Fund Investments in Note 18 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities for further information.\nPension and OPEB assets also include investments in hedge funds. Hedge fund investments include those that employ a broad range of strategies to enhance returns and provide additional diversification. The fair value of\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 15 - Retirement Benefits\nhedge funds is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, hedge funds are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. Exelon has the ability to redeem these investments at NAV or its equivalent subject to certain restrictions which may include a lock-up period or a gate.\nDefined Contribution Savings Plan (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants participate in various 401(k) defined contribution savings plans that are sponsored by Exelon. The plans are qualified under applicable sections of the IRC and allow employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax and/or after-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines. All Registrants match a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits. The following table presents matching contributions to the savings plan for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\n16. Derivative Financial Instruments (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk, interest rate risk, and foreign exchange risk related to ongoing business operations.\nAuthoritative guidance requires that derivative instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value of the derivative recognized in earnings immediately. Other accounting treatments are available through special election and designation, provided they meet specific, restrictive criteria both at the time of designation and on an ongoing basis. These alternative permissible accounting treatments include NPNS, cash flow hedges, and fair value hedges. All derivative economic hedges related to commodities, referred to as economic hedges, are recorded at fair value through earnings at Generation and are offset by a corresponding regulatory asset or liability at ComEd. For all NPNS derivative instruments, accounts receivable or accounts payable are recorded when derivative settles and revenue or expense is recognized in earnings as the underlying physical commodity is sold or consumed.\nAuthoritative guidance about offsetting assets and liabilities requires the fair value of derivative instruments to be shown in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on a gross basis, even when the derivative instruments are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements and qualify for net presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A master netting agreement is an agreement between two counterparties that may have derivative and non-derivative contracts with each other providing for the net settlement of all referenced contracts via one payment stream, which takes place as the contracts deliver, when collateral is requested or in the event of default. In the tables below, which present fair value balances, Generation\u2019s energy-related economic hedges and proprietary trading derivatives are shown gross. The impact of the netting of fair value balances with the same counterparty that are subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements, as well as netting of cash collateral, including margin on exchange positions, is aggregated in the collateral and netting columns.\nGeneration\u2019s and ComEd\u2019s use of cash collateral is generally unrestricted unless Generation or ComEd are downgraded below investment grade. Cash collateral held by PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE must be deposited in an unaffiliated major U.S. commercial bank or foreign bank with a U.S. branch office that meet certain qualifications.\nCommodity Price Risk (All Registrants)\nEach of the Registrants employ established policies and procedures to manage their risks associated with market fluctuations in commodity prices by entering into physical and financial derivative contracts, including swaps, futures, forwards, options, and short-term and long-term commitments to purchase and sell energy and commodity products. The Registrants believe these instruments, which are either determined to be non-derivative or classified as economic hedges, mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments\nGeneration. To the extent the amount of energy Generation produces differs from the amount of energy it has contracted to sell, Exelon and Generation are exposed to market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, fossil fuels, and other commodities. Within Exelon, Generation has the most exposure to commodity price risk. As such, Generation uses a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage the commodity price risk of its electric generation facilities, including power and gas sales, fuel and power purchases, natural gas transportation and pipeline capacity agreements, and other energy-related products marketed and purchased. To manage these risks, Generation may enter into fixed-price derivative or non-derivative contracts to hedge the variability in future cash flows from expected sales of power and gas and purchases of power and fuel. The objectives for executing such hedges include fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales at a level that provides an acceptable return. Generation is also exposed to differences between the locational settlement prices of certain economic hedges and the hedged generating units. This price difference is actively managed through other instruments which include derivative congestion products, whose changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period, and auction revenue rights, which are accounted for on an accrual basis.\nAdditionally, Generation is exposed to certain market risks through its proprietary trading activities. The proprietary trading activities are a complement to Generation\u2019s energy marketing portfolio but represent a small portion of Generation\u2019s overall energy marketing activities and are subject to limits established by Exelon\u2019s RMC.\nUtility Registrants. The Utility Registrants procure electric and natural gas supply through a competitive procurement process approved by each of the respective state utility commissions. The Utility Registrants\u2019 hedging programs are intended to reduce exposure to energy and natural gas price volatility and have no direct earnings impact as the costs are fully recovered from customers through regulatory-approved recovery mechanisms. The following table provides a summary of the Utility Registrants\u2019 primary derivative hedging instruments, listed by commodity and accounting treatment.\n_________\n(a)See Note 3-Regulatory Matters for additional information.\n(b)As part of its hedging program, PECO enters into electric supply procurement contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument.\n(c)The fair value of the DPL economic hedge is not material as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and is not presented in the fair value tables below.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe following table provides a summary of the derivative fair value balances recorded by Exelon, Generation, and ComEd as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n_________\n(a)Exelon and Generation net all available amounts allowed under the derivative authoritative guidance in the balance sheet. These amounts include unrealized derivative transactions with the same counterparty under legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. In some cases Exelon and Generation may have other offsetting exposures, subject to a master netting or similar agreement, such as trade receivables and payables, transactions that do not qualify as derivatives, letters of credit, and other forms of non-cash collateral. These amounts are not material and not reflected in the table above.\n(b)Of the collateral posted, $209 million and $511 million represents variation margin on the exchanges at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nEconomic Hedges (Commodity Price Risk)\nGeneration. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, Exelon and Generation recognized the following net pre-tax commodity mark-to-market gains (losses) which are also located in the Net fair value changes related to derivatives line in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments\nIn general, increases and decreases in forward market prices have a positive and negative impact, respectively, on Generation\u2019s owned and contracted generation positions that have not been hedged. Generation hedges commodity price risk on a ratable basis over three-year periods. As of December 31, 2020, the percentage of expected generation hedged for the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, and ERCOT reportable segments is 94%-97% for 2021.\nProprietary Trading (Commodity Price Risk)\nGeneration also executes commodity derivatives for proprietary trading purposes. Proprietary trading includes all contracts executed with the intent of benefiting from shifts or changes in market prices as opposed to those executed with the intent of hedging or managing risk. Gains and losses associated with proprietary trading are reported as Operating revenues in Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and are included in the Net fair value changes related to derivatives line in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, net pre-tax commodity mark-to-market gains and losses for Exelon and Generation were not material. The Utility Registrants do not execute derivatives for proprietary trading purposes.\nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange Risk (Exelon and Generation)\nExelon and Generation utilize interest rate swaps, which are treated as economic hedges, to manage their interest rate exposure. On July 1, 2018, Exelon de-designated its fair value hedges related to interest rate risk and Generation de-designated its cash flow hedges related to interest rate risk. The notional amounts were $516 million and $1,269 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for Exelon and $516 million and $569 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for Generation.\nGeneration utilizes foreign currency derivatives to manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international commodity purchases in currencies other than U.S. dollars, which are treated as economic hedges. The notional amounts were $149 million and $231 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe mark-to-market derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the mark-to-market gains and losses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were not material for Exelon and Generation.\nCredit Risk (All Registrants)\nThe Registrants would be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties on executed derivative instruments. The credit exposure of derivative contracts, before collateral, is represented by the fair value of contracts at the reporting date.\nGeneration. For commodity derivatives, Generation enters into enabling agreements that allow for payment netting with its counterparties, which reduces Generation\u2019s exposure to counterparty risk by providing for the offset of amounts payable to the counterparty against amounts receivable from the counterparty. Typically, each enabling agreement is for a specific commodity and so, with respect to each individual counterparty, netting is limited to transactions involving that specific commodity product, except where master netting agreements exist with a counterparty that allow for cross product netting. In addition to payment netting language in the enabling agreement, Generation\u2019s credit department establishes credit limits, margining thresholds and collateral requirements for each counterparty, which are defined in the derivative contracts. Counterparty credit limits are based on an internal credit review process that considers a variety of factors, including the results of a scoring model, leverage, liquidity, profitability, credit ratings by credit rating agencies, and risk management capabilities. To the extent that a counterparty\u2019s margining thresholds are exceeded, the counterparty is required to post collateral with Generation as specified in each enabling agreement. Generation\u2019s credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates, both on an individual and an aggregate basis.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe following tables provide information on Generation\u2019s credit exposure for all derivative instruments, NPNS, and payables and receivables, net of collateral and instruments that are subject to master netting agreements, as of December 31, 2020. The tables further delineate that exposure by credit rating of the counterparties and provide guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties. The figures in the tables below exclude credit risk exposure from individual retail counterparties, nuclear fuel procurement contracts, and exposure through RTOs, ISOs, NYMEX, ICE, NASDAQ, NGX, and Nodal commodity exchanges.\n__________\n(a)As of December 31, 2020, credit collateral held from counterparties where Generation had credit exposure included $31 million of cash and $25 million of letters of credit. The credit collateral does not include non-liquid collateral.\nUtility Registrants. The Utility Registrants have contracts to procure electric and natural gas supply that provide suppliers with a certain amount of unsecured credit. If the exposure on the supply contract exceeds the amount of unsecured credit, the suppliers may be required to post collateral. The net credit exposure is mitigated primarily by the ability to recover procurement costs through customer rates. As of December 31, 2020, the Utility Registrants\u2019 counterparty credit risk with suppliers was not material.\nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features (All Registrants)\nGeneration. As part of the normal course of business, Generation routinely enters into physically or financially settled contracts for the purchase and sale of electric capacity, electricity, fuels, emissions allowances, and other energy-related products. Certain of Generation\u2019s derivative instruments contain provisions that require Generation to post collateral. Generation also enters into commodity transactions on exchanges where the exchanges act as the counterparty to each trade. Transactions on the exchanges must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining requirements. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon Generation\u2019s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. The collateral and credit support requirements vary by contract and by counterparty. These credit-risk related contingent features stipulate that if Generation were to be downgraded or lose its investment grade credit rating (based on its senior unsecured debt rating), it would be required to provide additional collateral. This incremental collateral requirement allows for the offsetting of derivative instruments that are assets with the same counterparty, where the contractual right of offset exists under applicable master netting agreements. In the absence of expressly agreed-to provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided, collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of the demand. In this case, Generation believes an amount of several months of future payments (i.e., capacity payments) rather than a calculation of fair value is the best estimate for the contingent collateral obligation, which has been factored into the disclosure below.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features in a liability position that are not fully collateralized (excluding transactions on the exchanges that are fully collateralized) is detailed in the table below:\n__________\n(a)Amount represents the gross fair value of out-of-the-money derivative contracts containing credit-risk-related contingent features ignoring the effects of master netting agreements.\n(b)Amount represents the offsetting fair value of in-the-money derivative contracts under legally enforceable master netting agreements with the same counterparty, which reduces the amount of any liability for which Generation could potentially be required to post collateral.\n(c)Amount represents the net fair value of out-of-the-money derivative contracts containing credit-risk related contingent features after considering the mitigating effects of offsetting positions under master netting arrangements and reflects the actual net liability upon which any potential contingent collateral obligations would be based.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Exelon and Generation posted or held the following amounts of cash collateral and letters of credit on derivative contracts with external counterparties, after giving consideration to offsetting derivative and non-derivative positions under master netting agreements.\nGeneration entered into supply forward contracts with certain utilities, including PECO and BGE, with one-sided collateral postings only from Generation. If market prices fall below the benchmark price levels in these contracts, the utilities are not required to post collateral. However, when market prices rise above the benchmark price levels, counterparty suppliers, including Generation, are required to post collateral once certain unsecured credit limits are exceeded.\nUtility Registrants\nThe Utility Registrants\u2019 electric supply procurement contracts do not contain provisions that would require them to post collateral.\nPECO\u2019s, BGE\u2019s, and DPL\u2019s natural gas procurement contracts contain provisions that could require PECO, BGE, and DPL to post collateral in the form of cash or credit support, which vary by contract and counterparty, with thresholds contingent upon PECO\u2019s, BGE's, and DPL\u2019s credit rating. As of December 31, 2020, PECO, BGE, and DPL were not required to post collateral for any of these agreements. If PECO, BGE, or DPL lost their investment grade credit rating as of December 31, 2020, they could have been required to post incremental collateral to their counterparties of $34 million, $54 million, and $9 million, respectively.\n17. Debt and Credit Agreements (All Registrants)\nShort-Term Borrowings\nExelon Corporate, ComEd, and BGE meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. Generation and PECO meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings from the Exelon intercompany money pool. Pepco, DPL, and ACE meet their short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 - Debt and Credit Agreements\nfrom the PHI intercompany money pool. PHI Corporate meets its short-term liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of short-term notes and borrowings from the Exelon intercompany money pool. The Registrants may use their respective credit facilities for general corporate purposes, including meeting short-term funding requirements and the issuance of letters of credit.\nCommercial Paper\nThe following table reflects the Registrants' commercial paper programs supported by the revolving credit agreements and bilateral credit agreements at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n__________\n(a)Excludes $1,500 million and $1,400 million in bilateral credit facilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $144 million and $159 million in credit facilities for project finance at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These credit facilities do not back Generation's commercial paper program.\n(b)At December 31, 2020, excludes $135 million of credit facility agreements arranged at minority and community banks at Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE with aggregate commitments of $38 million, $32 million, $33 million, $8 million, $8 million, $8 million, and $8 million, respectively. These facilities expire on October 8, 2021. These facilities are solely utilized to issue letters of credit. At December 31, 2019, excludes $142 million of credit facility agreements arranged at minority and community banks at Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE with aggregate commitments of $44 million, $33 million, $33 million, $8 million, $8 million, $8 million, and $8 million, respectively.\n(c)Pepco, DPL, and ACE's revolving credit facility has the ability to flex to $500 million, $500 million, and $350 million, respectively. The borrowing capacity may be increased or decreased during the term of the facility, except that (i) the sum of the borrowing capacity must equal the total amount of the facility, and (ii) the aggregate amount of credit used at any given time by each of Pepco, DPL, or ACE may not exceed $900 million or the maximum amount of short-term debt the company is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities.

The credit agreements also require the borrower to pay a facility fee based upon the aggregate commitments. The fee varies depending upon the respective credit ratings of the borrower.\nVariable Rate Demand Bonds\nDPL has outstanding obligations in respect of Variable Rate Demand Bonds (VRDB). VRDBs are subject to repayment on the demand of the holders and, for this reason, are accounted for as short-term debt in accordance with GAAP. However, these bonds may be converted to a fixed-rate, fixed-term option to establish a maturity which corresponds to the date of final maturity of the bonds. On this basis, PHI views VRDBs as a source of long-term financing. As of both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, $79 million in variable\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 - Debt and Credit Agreements\nrate demand bonds issued by DPL were outstanding and are included in the Long-term debt due within one year in Exelon's, PHI's, and DPL's Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe following tables present the outstanding long-term debt at the Registrants as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nExelon\n__________\n(a)Substantially all of ComEd\u2019s assets other than expressly excepted property and substantially all of PECO\u2019s, Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's assets are subject to the liens of their respective mortgage indentures.\n(b)Amounts owed to these financing trusts are recorded as Long-term debt to financing trusts within Exelon\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 - Debt and Credit Agreements\nGeneration\nComEd\n__________\n(a)Substantially all of ComEd\u2019s assets, other than expressly excepted property, are subject to the lien of its mortgage indenture.\n(b)Amount owed to this financing trust is recorded as Long-term debt to financing trust within ComEd\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 - Debt and Credit Agreements\nPECO\n__________\n(a)Substantially all of PECO\u2019s assets are subject to the lien of its mortgage indenture.\n(b)Amounts owed to this financing trust are recorded as Long-term debt to financing trusts within PECO\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nBGE\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 - Debt and Credit Agreements\nPHI\n_________\n(a)Substantially all of Pepco's, DPL's, and ACE's assets are subject to the liens of their respective mortgage indentures.\nPepco\n__________\n(a)Substantially all of Pepco's assets are subject to the lien of its mortgage indenture.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 - Debt and Credit Agreements\nDPL\n__________\n(a)Substantially all of DPL's assets are subject to the lien of its mortgage indenture.\nACE\n__________\n(a)Substantially all of ACE's assets are subject to the lien of its mortgage indenture.\nLong-term debt maturities at the Registrants in the periods 2021 through 2025 and thereafter are as follows:\n__________\n(a)Includes $390 million due to ComEd and PECO financing trusts.\n(b)Includes $206 million due to ComEd financing trust.\n(c)Includes $184 million due to PECO financing trusts.\nDebt Covenants\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Registrants are in compliance with debt covenants.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 17 - Debt and Credit Agreements\nNonrecourse Debt\nExelon and Generation have issued nonrecourse debt financing, in which approximately $2.2 billion of generating assets have been pledged as collateral at December 31, 2020. Borrowings under these agreements are secured by the assets and equity of each respective project. The lenders do not have recourse against Exelon or Generation in the event of a default. If a specific project financing entity does not maintain compliance with its specific nonrecourse debt financing covenants, there could be a requirement to accelerate repayment of the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than the stated maturity dates. In these instances, if such repayment was not satisfied, the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the project-specific assets and related collateral. The potential requirement to satisfy its associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated could lead to impairments due to a higher likelihood of disposing of the respective project-specific assets significantly before the end of their useful lives.\nAntelope Valley Solar Ranch One. In December 2011, the DOE Loan Programs Office issued a guarantee for up to $646 million for a nonrecourse loan from the Federal Financing Bank to support the financing of the construction of the Antelope Valley facility. The project became fully operational in 2014. The loan will mature on January 5, 2037. Interest rates on the loan were fixed upon each advance at a spread of 37.5 basis points above U.S. Treasuries of comparable maturity. The advances were completed as of December 31, 2015 and the outstanding loan balance will bear interest at an average blended interest rate of 2.82%. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, approximately $460 million and $485 million were outstanding, respectively. In addition, Generation has issued letters of credit to support its equity investment in the project. As of December 31, 2020, Generation had $37 million in letters of credit outstanding related to the project. In December 2017, Generation\u2019s interests in Antelope Valley were contributed to and are pledged as collateral for the EGR IV financing structures referenced below.\nAntelope Valley sells all of its output to PG&E through a PPA. On January 29, 2019, PG&E filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which created an event of default for Antelope Valley\u2019s nonrecourse debt that provided the lender with a right to accelerate amounts outstanding under the loan such that they would become immediately due and payable. As a result of the event of default and in the absence of a waiver from the lender foregoing their acceleration rights, the debt was reclassified as current in Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets in the first quarter of 2019. Further, distributions from Antelope Valley to EGR IV were suspended.\nThe United States Bankruptcy Court entered an order on June 20, 2020 confirming PG&E\u2019s plan of reorganization. On July 1, 2020 the plan became effective, and PG&E emerged from bankruptcy. On July 21, 2020, Antelope Valley received a waiver from the DOE for the event of default and, as such, distributions from Antelope Valley to EGR IV were permitted and the debt was classified as noncurrent as of June 30, 2020. The debt continues to be presented as noncurrent as of December 31, 2020.\nSee Note 12 - Asset Impairments for additional information.\nContinental Wind, LLC.

As a result of the sale agreement with an affiliate of Brookfield Renewable in the fourth quarter of 2020, the outstanding balance was reclassified to Liabilities held for sale in Exelon's and Generation's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020. In 2017, Generation\u2019s interests in SolGen were contributed to and were pledged as collateral for the EGR IV financing structure. In December 2020, as part of the EGR IV financing, SolGen was removed from the collateral terms structured within the agreement. See EGR IV discussed below for additional information and Note 2 - Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions for additional information on the sale agreement.\nExGen Renewables IV.

Generation\u2019s interests in EGRP and Antelope Valley remained contributed to and are pledged as collateral for this financing. As of December 31, 2020, $750 million was outstanding. See Note 23 - Variable Interest Entities for additional information on EGRP and Note 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information on interest rate swaps.\n18. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities (All Registrants)\nExelon measures and classifies fair value measurements in accordance with the hierarchy as defined by GAAP. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:\n\u2022Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Registrants have the ability to liquidate as of the reporting date.\n\u2022Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data.\n\u2022Level 3 - unobservable inputs, such as internally developed pricing models or third-party valuations for the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or liability.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nFair Value of Financial Liabilities Recorded at Amortized Cost\nThe following tables present the carrying amounts and fair values of the Registrants\u2019 short-term liabilities, long-term debt, SNF obligation, and trust preferred securities (long-term debt to financing trusts or junior subordinated debentures) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased, including mutual and money market funds, are considered cash equivalents. The fair values are based on observable market prices and, therefore, are included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1.\nNDT Fund Investments (Exelon and Generation). The trust fund investments have been established to satisfy Generation\u2019s and CENG's nuclear decommissioning obligations as required by the NRC. The NDT funds hold debt and equity securities directly and indirectly through commingled funds and mutual funds, which are included in equities and fixed income. Generation\u2019s and CENG's NDT fund investments policies outline investment guidelines for the trusts and limit the trust funds\u2019 exposures to investments in highly illiquid markets and other alternative investments, including private credit, private equity, and real estate. Investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed income securities are considered cash equivalents and included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1 or Level 2.\nEquities. These investments consist of individually held equity securities, equity mutual funds, and equity commingled funds in domestic and foreign markets. With respect to individually held equity securities, the trustees obtain prices from pricing services, whose prices are generally obtained from direct feeds from market exchanges, which Exelon and Generation are able to independently corroborate. Equity securities held individually, including real estate investment trusts, rights, and warrants, are primarily traded on exchanges that contain only actively traded securities due to the volume trading requirements imposed by these exchanges. The equity securities that are held directly by the trust funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and categorized as Level 1. Certain equity securities have been categorized as Level 2 because they are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or similar securities. Certain private placement equity securities are categorized as Level 3 because they are not publicly traded and are priced using significant unobservable inputs.\nEquity commingled funds and mutual funds are maintained by investment companies, and fund investments are held in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For equity commingled funds and mutual funds which are not publicly quoted, the fund administrators value the funds using the NAV per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. These investments typically can be redeemed monthly or more frequently, with 30 or less days of notice and without further restrictions.\nFixed income. For fixed income securities, which consist primarily of corporate debt securities, U.S. government securities, foreign government securities, municipal bonds, asset and mortgage-backed securities, commingled funds, mutual funds, and derivative instruments, the trustees obtain multiple prices from pricing vendors whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations in addition to checks for unusual daily movements. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class, or issue for each security. With respect to individually held fixed income securities, the trustees monitor prices supplied by pricing services and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source of a given security if the portfolio managers challenge an assigned price and the trustees determine that another price source is considered to be preferable. Exelon and Generation have obtained an understanding of how these prices are derived, including the nature and observability of the inputs used in deriving such prices. Additionally, Exelon and Generation selectively\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\ncorroborate the fair values of securities by comparison to other market-based price sources. Investments in U.S. Treasury securities have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid and transparent markets. Certain private placement fixed income securities have been categorized as Level 3 because they are priced using certain significant unobservable inputs and are typically illiquid. The remaining fixed income securities, including certain other fixed income investments, are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized as Level 2.\nOther fixed income investments primarily consist of fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds, which are maintained by investment companies and hold fund investments in accordance with a stated set of fund objectives. The values of some of these funds are publicly quoted. For mutual funds which are publicly quoted, the funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and have been categorized as Level 1. For fixed income commingled funds and mutual funds which are not publicly quoted, the fund administrators value the funds using the NAV per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. These investments typically can be redeemed monthly or more frequently, with 30 or less days of notice and without further restrictions.\nDerivative instruments. These instruments, consisting primarily of futures and swaps to manage risk, are recorded at fair value. Over-the-counter derivatives are valued daily, based on quoted prices in active markets and trade in open markets, and have been categorized as Level 1. Derivative instruments other than over-the-counter derivatives are valued based on external price data of comparable securities and have been categorized as Level 2.\nPrivate credit. Private credit investments primarily consist of investments in private debt strategies. These investments are generally less liquid assets with an underlying term of 3 to 5 years and are intended to be held to maturity. The fair value of these investments is determined by the fund manager or administrator using a combination of valuation models including cost models, market models, and income models and typically cannot be redeemed until maturity of the term loan. Private credit investments held directly by Exelon and Generation are categorized as Level 3 because they are based largely on inputs that are unobservable and utilize complex valuation models. For managed private credit funds, the fair value is determined using a combination of valuation models including cost models, market models, and income models and typically cannot be redeemed until maturity of the term loan. Managed private credit fund investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy because their fair value is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient.\nPrivate equity. These investments include those in limited partnerships that invest in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange such as leveraged buyouts, growth capital, venture capital, distressed investments, and investments in natural resources. These investments typically cannot be redeemed and are generally liquidated over a period of 8 to 10 years from the initial investment date, which is based on Exelon's understanding of the investment funds. Private equity valuations are reported by the fund manager and are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include unobservable inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows, and market based comparable data. These valuation inputs are unobservable. The fair value of private equity investments is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, these investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nReal estate. These investments are funds with a direct investment in pools of real estate properties. These funds are reported by the fund manager and are generally based on independent appraisals from sources with professional qualifications, typically using a combination of market comparables and discounted cash flows. These valuation inputs are unobservable. The fair value of real estate investments is determined using NAV or its equivalent as a practical expedient, and therefore, these investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nGeneration evaluated its NDT portfolios for the existence of significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2020. Types of concentrations that were evaluated include, but are not limited to, investment concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, foreign country, and individual fund. As of December 31, 2020, there were no significant concentrations (generally defined as greater than 10 percent) of risk in Generation's NDT assets.\nSee Note 10 - Asset Retirement Obligations for additional information on the NDT fund investments. See Note 15 - Retirement Benefits for the valuation techniques used for hedge fund investments.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nRabbi Trust Investments (Exelon, Generation, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE). The Rabbi trusts were established to hold assets related to deferred compensation plans existing for certain active and retired members of Exelon\u2019s executive management and directors. The Rabbi trusts' assets are included in investments in the Registrants\u2019 Consolidated Balance Sheets and consist primarily of money market funds, mutual funds, fixed income securities, and life insurance policies. Money market funds and mutual funds are publicly quoted and have been categorized as Level 1 given the clear observability of the prices. The fair values of fixed income securities are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information or similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized in Level 2. The life insurance policies are valued using the cash surrender value of the policies, net of loans against those policies, which is provided by a third-party. Certain life insurance policies, which consist primarily of mutual funds that are priced based on observable market data, have been categorized as Level 2 because the life insurance policies can be liquidated at the reporting date for the value of the underlying assets. Life insurance policies that are valued using unobservable inputs have been categorized as Level 3, where the fair value is determined based on the cash surrender value of the policy, which contains unobservable inputs and assumptions. Because Exelon relies on its third-party insurance provider to develop the inputs without adjustment for the valuations of its Level 3 investments, quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used in valuing these investments is not reasonably available to Exelon. Therefore, Exelon has not disclosed such inputs.\nDeferred Compensation Obligations (All Registrants). The Registrants\u2019 deferred compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash compensation into a notional investment account. The Registrants include such plans in other current and noncurrent liabilities in their Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Registrants\u2019 deferred compensation obligations is based on the market value of the participants\u2019 notional investment accounts. The underlying notional investments are comprised primarily of equities, mutual funds, commingled funds, and fixed income securities which are based on directly and indirectly observable market prices. Since the deferred compensation obligations themselves are not exchanged in an active market, they are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe value of certain employment agreement obligations (which are included with the Deferred Compensation Obligation in the tables above) are based on a known and certain stream of payments to be made over time and are categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nInvestments in Equities (Exelon and Generation). Exelon and Generation hold certain investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values in addition to those held within the NDT funds. These equity securities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized as Level 1.\nDeferred Purchase Price Consideration (Exelon and Generation). Exelon and Generation have DPP consideration for the sale of certain receivables of retail electricity at Generation. This amount is valued based on the sales price of the receivables net of allowance for credit losses based on accounts receivable aging historical experience coupled with specific identification through a credit monitoring process, which considers current conditions and forward-looking information such as industry trends, macroeconomic factors, changes in the regulatory environment, external credit ratings, publicly available news, payment status, payment history, and the exercise of collateral calls. Since the DPP consideration is based on the sales price of the receivables, it is categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 6 - Accounts Receivable for additional information on the sale of certain receivables.\nMark-to-Market Derivatives (Exelon, Generation, and ComEd). Derivative contracts are traded in both exchange-based and non-exchange-based markets. Exchange-based derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are categorized in Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Certain derivatives\u2019 pricing is verified using indicative price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges and are categorized in Level 2. These price quotations reflect the average of the bid-ask, mid-point prices and are obtained from sources that the Registrants believe provide the most liquid market for the commodity. The price quotations are reviewed and corroborated to ensure the prices are observable and representative of an orderly transaction between market participants. This includes consideration of actual transaction volumes, market delivery points, bid-ask spreads, and contract duration. The remainder of derivative contracts are valued using the Black model, an industry standard option valuation model. The Black model takes into account inputs such as contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, including assumptions of the future prices of energy, interest rates, volatility, credit worthiness, and credit spread. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps, and options, model inputs are generally observable. Such instruments are categorized in Level 2. The Registrants\u2019 derivatives are predominantly at liquid trading points.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nFor derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs. These valuations may include an estimated basis adjustment from an illiquid trading point to a liquid trading point for which active price quotations are available. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3.\nFor valuations that include both observable and unobservable inputs, if the unobservable input is determined to be significant to the overall inputs, the entire valuation is categorized in Level 3. This includes derivatives valued using indicative price quotations whose contract tenure extends into unobservable periods. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility, and contract duration. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 as the model inputs generally are not observable. Forward price curves for the power market utilized by the front office to manage the portfolio, are reviewed and verified by the middle office, and used for financial reporting by the back office. The Registrants consider credit and nonperformance risk in the valuation of derivative contracts categorized in Level 2 and 3, including both historical and current market data, in their assessment of credit and nonperformance risk by counterparty. Due to master netting agreements and collateral posting requirements, the impacts of credit and nonperformance risk were not material to the financial statements.\nDisclosed below is detail surrounding the Registrants\u2019 significant Level 3 valuations. The calculated fair value includes marketability discounts for margining provisions and other attributes. Generation\u2019s Level 3 balance generally consists of forward sales and purchases of power and natural gas and certain transmission congestion contracts. Generation utilizes various inputs and factors including market data and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities as well as assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. The inputs and factors include forward commodity prices, commodity price volatility, contractual volumes, delivery location, interest rates, credit quality of counterparties, and credit enhancements.\nFor commodity derivatives, the primary input to the valuation models is the forward commodity price curve for each instrument. Forward commodity price curves are derived by risk management for liquid locations and by the traders and portfolio managers for illiquid locations. All locations are reviewed and verified by risk management considering published exchange transaction prices, executed bilateral transactions, broker quotes, and other observable or public data sources. The relevant forward commodity curve used to value each of the derivatives depends on a number of factors, including commodity type, delivery location, and delivery period. Price volatility varies by commodity and location. When appropriate, Generation discounts future cash flows using risk free interest rates with adjustments to reflect the credit quality of each counterparty for assets and Generation\u2019s own credit quality for liabilities. The level of observability of a forward commodity price varies generally due to the delivery location and delivery period. Certain delivery locations including PJM West Hub (for power) and Henry Hub (for natural gas) are more liquid and prices are observable for up to three years in the future. The observability period of volatility is generally shorter than the underlying power curve used in option valuations. The forward curve for a less liquid location is estimated by using the forward curve from the liquid location and applying a spread to represent the cost to transport the commodity to the delivery location. This spread does not typically represent a majority of the instrument\u2019s market price. As a result, the change in fair value is closely tied to liquid market movements and not a change in the applied spread. The change in fair value associated with a change in the spread is generally immaterial. An average spread calculated across all Level 3 power and gas delivery locations is approximately $2.49 and $0.38 for power and natural gas, respectively. Many of the commodity derivatives are short term in nature and thus a majority of the fair value may be based on observable inputs even though the contract as a whole must be classified as Level 3.\nOn December 17, 2010, ComEd entered into several 20-year floating to fixed energy swap contracts with unaffiliated suppliers for the procurement of long-term renewable energy and associated RECs. See Note 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information. The fair value of these swaps has been designated as a Level 3 valuation due to the long tenure of the positions and internal modeling assumptions. The modeling assumptions include using natural gas heat rates to project long term forward power curves adjusted by a renewable factor that incorporates time of day and seasonality factors to reflect accurate renewable energy pricing. In addition, marketability reserves are applied to the positions based on the tenor and supplier risk.\nSee Note 16 - Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information on mark-to-market derivatives.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 18 - Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table presents the significant inputs to the forward curve used to value these positions:\n__________\n(a)The valuation techniques, unobservable inputs, ranges, and arithmetic averages are the same for the asset and liability positions.\n(b)The fair values do not include cash collateral posted on level three positions of $162 million and $214 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n(c)Quoted forward natural gas rates are utilized to project the forward power curve for the delivery of energy at specified future dates. The natural gas curve is extrapolated beyond its observable period to the end of the contract\u2019s delivery.\nThe inputs listed above, which are as of the balance sheet date, would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above instruments if they were adjusted. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of Generation\u2019s commodity derivatives are forward commodity prices and for options is price volatility. Increases (decreases) in the forward commodity price in isolation would result in significantly higher (lower) fair values for long positions (contracts that give Generation the obligation or option to purchase a commodity), with offsetting impacts to short positions (contracts that give Generation the obligation or right to sell a commodity). Increases (decreases) in volatility would increase (decrease) the value for the holder of the option (writer of the option). Generally, a change in the estimate of forward commodity prices is unrelated to a change in the estimate of volatility of prices. An increase to the reserves listed above would decrease the fair value of the positions. An increase to the heat rate or renewable factors would increase the fair value accordingly. Generally, interrelationships exist between market prices of natural gas and power. As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power markets.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 19 - Commitments and Contingencies\n19. Commitments and Contingencies (All Registrants)\nCommitments\nPHI Merger Commitments (Exelon, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE). Approval of the PHI merger in Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and the District of Columbia was conditioned upon Exelon and PHI agreeing to certain commitments. The following amounts represent total commitment costs that have been recorded since the acquisition date and the total remaining obligations for Exelon, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE as of December 31, 2020:\n__________\n(a)Remaining commitments extend through 2026 and include rate credits, energy efficiency programs, and delivery system modernization.\nIn addition, Exelon is committed to develop or to assist in the commercial development of approximately 37 MWs of new solar generation in Maryland, District of Columbia, and Delaware at an estimated cost of approximately $135 million, which will generate future earnings at Exelon and Generation. Investment costs, which are expected to be primarily capital in nature, are recognized as incurred and recorded in Exelon's and Generation's financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, 27 MWs of new generation were developed and Exelon and Generation have incurred costs of $119 million. Exelon has also committed to purchase 100 MWs of wind energy in PJM. DPL has committed to conducting three RFPs to procure up to a total of 120 MWs of wind RECs for the purpose of meeting Delaware's renewable portfolio standards. DPL has conducted two of the three wind REC RFPs. The first 40 MW wind REC tranche was conducted in 2017 and did not result in a purchase agreement. The second 40 MW wind REC tranche was conducted in 2018 and resulted in a proposed REC purchase agreement that was approved by the DPSC in March 2019. The third and final 40 MW wind REC tranche will be conducted in 2022.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 19 - Commitments and Contingencies\nCommercial Commitments (All Registrants). The Registrants' commercial commitments as of December 31, 2020, representing commitments potentially triggered by future events, were as follows:\n__________\n(a)Surety bonds-Guarantees issued related to contract and commercial agreements, excluding bid bonds.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 19 - Commitments and Contingencies\n(b)Represents the maximum potential obligation in the event that the fair value of certain leased equipment and fleet vehicles is zero at the end of the maximum lease term. The lease term associated with these assets ranges from 1 to 8 years. The maximum potential obligation at the end of the minimum lease term would be $71 million guaranteed by Exelon and PHI, of which $24 million, $30 million, and $17 million is guaranteed by Pepco, DPL, and ACE, respectively. Historically, payments under the guarantees have not been made and PHI believes the likelihood of payments being required under the guarantees is remote.\nNuclear Insurance (Exelon and Generation)\nGeneration is subject to liability, property damage, and other risks associated with major incidents at any of its nuclear stations. Generation has mitigated its financial exposure to these risks through insurance and other industry risk-sharing provisions.\nThe Price-Anderson Act was enacted to ensure the availability of funds for public liability claims arising from an incident at any of the U.S. licensed nuclear facilities and to limit the liability of nuclear reactor owners for such claims from any single incident. As of December 31, 2020, the current liability limit per incident is $13.8 billion and is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation and changes in the number of licensed reactors at least once every five years with the last adjustment effective November 1, 2018. In accordance with the Price-Anderson Act, Generation maintains financial protection at levels equal to the amount of liability insurance available from private sources through the purchase of private nuclear energy liability insurance for public liability claims that could arise in the event of an incident. Effective January 1, 2017, the required amount of nuclear energy liability insurance purchased is $450 million for each operating site. Claims exceeding that amount are covered through mandatory participation in a financial protection pool, as required by the Price Anderson-Act, which provides the additional $13.3 billion per incident in funds available for public liability claims. Participation in this secondary financial protection pool requires the operator of each reactor to fund its proportionate share of costs for any single incident that exceeds the primary layer of financial protection. Generation\u2019s share of this secondary layer would be approximately $2.9 billion, however any amounts payable under this secondary layer would be capped at $434 million per year.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay public liability claims exceeding the $13.8 billion limit for a single incident.\nAs part of the execution of the NOSA on April 1, 2014, Generation executed an Indemnity Agreement pursuant to which Generation agreed to indemnify EDF and its affiliates against third-party claims that may arise from any future nuclear incident (as defined in the Price-Anderson Act) in connection with the CENG nuclear plants or their operations. Exelon guarantees Generation\u2019s obligations under this indemnity. See Note 23 - Variable Interest Entities for additional information on Generation\u2019s operations relating to CENG.\nGeneration is required each year to report to the NRC the current levels and sources of property insurance that demonstrates Generation possesses sufficient financial resources to stabilize and decontaminate a reactor and reactor station site in the event of an accident. The property insurance maintained for each facility is currently provided through insurance policies purchased from NEIL, an industry mutual insurance company of which Generation is a member.\nNEIL may declare distributions to its members as a result of favorable operating experience. In recent years, NEIL has made distributions to its members, but Generation cannot predict the level of future distributions or if they will continue at all. Generation's portion of the annual distribution declared by NEIL is estimated to be $75 million for 2020, and was $136 million and $58 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, in March 2018, NEIL declared a supplemental distribution. Generation's portion of the supplemental distribution declared by NEIL was $31 million. The distributions were recorded as a reduction to Operating and maintenance expense within Exelon and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nPremiums paid to NEIL by its members are also subject to a potential assessment for adverse loss experience in the form of a retrospective premium obligation. NEIL has never assessed this retrospective premium since its formation in 1973, and Generation cannot predict the level of future assessments, if any. The current maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligation for Generation is approximately $252 million. NEIL requires its members to maintain an investment grade credit rating or to ensure collectability of their annual retrospective premium obligation by providing a financial guarantee, letter of credit, deposit premium, or some other means of assurance.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 19 - Commitments and Contingencies\nNEIL provides \u201call risk\u201d property damage, decontamination, and premature decommissioning insurance for each station for losses resulting from damage to its nuclear plants, either due to accidents or acts of terrorism. If the decision is made to decommission the facility, a portion of the insurance proceeds will be allocated to a fund, which Generation is required by the NRC to maintain, to provide for decommissioning the facility. In the event of an insured loss, Generation is unable to predict the timing of the availability of insurance proceeds to Generation and the amount of such proceeds that would be available. In the event that one or more acts of terrorism cause accidental property damage within a twelve-month period from the first accidental property damage under one or more policies for all insured plants, the maximum recovery by Generation will be an aggregate of $3.2 billion plus such additional amounts as the insurer may recover for all such losses from reinsurance, indemnity, and any other source, applicable to such losses.\nFor its insured losses, Generation is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recoverable from insurers or the nuclear industry, could also be borne by Generation. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s financial statements.\nSpent Nuclear Fuel Obligation (Exelon and Generation)\nUnder the NWPA, the DOE is responsible for the development of a geologic repository for and the disposal of SNF and high-level radioactive waste. As required by the NWPA, Generation is a party to contracts with the DOE (Standard Contracts) to provide for disposal of SNF from Generation\u2019s nuclear generating stations. In accordance with the NWPA and the Standard Contracts, Generation historically had paid the DOE one mill ($0.001) per kWh of net nuclear generation for the cost of SNF disposal. Due to the lack of a viable disposal program, the DOE reduced the SNF disposal fee to zero in May 2014. Until a new fee structure is in effect, Exelon and Generation will not accrue any further costs related to SNF disposal fees. This fee may be adjusted prospectively to ensure full cost recovery.\nGeneration currently assumes the DOE will begin accepting SNF in 2035 and uses that date for purposes of estimating the nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligations. The SNF acceptance date assumption is based on management\u2019s estimates of the amount of time required for DOE to select a site location and develop the necessary infrastructure for long-term SNF storage.\nThe NWPA and the Standard Contracts required the DOE to begin taking possession of SNF generated by nuclear generating units by no later than January 31, 1998. The DOE, however, failed to meet that deadline and its performance is expected to be delayed significantly. In August 2004, Generation and the DOJ, in close consultation with the DOE, reached a settlement under which the government agreed to reimburse Generation, subject to certain damage limitations based on the extent of the government\u2019s breach, for costs associated with storage of SNF at Generation\u2019s nuclear stations pending the DOE\u2019s fulfillment of its obligations. Generation\u2019s settlement agreement does not include FitzPatrick and FitzPatrick does not currently have a settlement agreement in place. Calvert Cliffs, Ginna, and Nine Mile Point each have separate settlement agreements in place with the DOE which were extended during 2020 to provide for the reimbursement of SNF storage costs through December 31, 2022. Generation submits annual reimbursement requests to the DOE for costs associated with the storage of SNF. In all cases, reimbursement requests are made only after costs are incurred and only for costs resulting from DOE delays in accepting the SNF.\nUnder the settlement agreements, Generation received total cumulative cash reimbursements of $1,455 million through December 31, 2020 for costs incurred. After considering the amounts due to co-owners of certain nuclear stations and to the former owner of Oyster Creek, Generation received net cumulative cash reimbursements of $1,266 million. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of SNF storage costs for which reimbursement has been or will be requested from the DOE under the DOE settlement agreements is as follows:\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 19 - Commitments and Contingencies\n__________\n(a)Recorded in Accounts receivable, other.\n(b)Recorded in Deferred debits and other assets, other.\n(c)Recorded in Accounts receivable, other. Represents amounts owed to the co-owners of Peach Bottom, Quad Cities, and Nine Mile Point Unit 2 generating facilities.\nThe Standard Contracts with the DOE also required the payment to the DOE of a one-time fee applicable to nuclear generation through April 6, 1983. The below table outlines the SNF liability recorded at Exelon and Generation as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n__________\n(a)ComEd previously elected to defer payment of the one-time fee of $277 million for its units (which are now part of Generation), with interest to the date of payment, until just prior to the first delivery of SNF to the DOE. The unfunded liabilities for SNF disposal costs, including the one-time fee, were transferred to Generation as part of Exelon\u2019s 2001 corporate restructuring.\n(b)A prior owner of FitzPatrick elected to defer payment of the one-time fee of $34 million, with interest to the date of payment, for the FitzPatrick unit. As part of the FitzPatrick acquisition on March 31, 2017, Generation assumed a SNF liability for the DOE one-time fee obligation with interest related to FitzPatrick along with an offsetting asset, included in Other deferred debits and other assets, for the contractual right to reimbursement from NYPA, a prior owner of FitzPatrick, for amounts paid for the FitzPatrick DOE one-time fee obligation.\nInterest for Exelon's and Generation's SNF liabilities accrues at the 13-week Treasury Rate. The 13-week Treasury Rate in effect for calculation of the interest accrual at December 31, 2020 was 0.096% for the deferred amount transferred from ComEd and 0.101% for the deferred FitzPatrick amount.\nThe following table summarizes sites for which Exelon and Generation do not have an outstanding SNF Obligation:\nEnvironmental Remediation Matters\nGeneral (All Registrants). The Registrants\u2019 operations have in the past, and may in the future, require substantial expenditures to comply with environmental laws. Additionally, under Federal and state environmental laws, the Registrants are generally liable for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by them and of property contaminated by hazardous substances generated by them. The Registrants own or lease a number of real estate parcels, including parcels on which their operations or the operations of others may have resulted in contamination by substances that are considered hazardous under environmental laws. In addition, the Registrants are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. Unless otherwise disclosed, the Registrants cannot reasonably estimate whether they will incur significant liabilities for additional investigation and remediation costs at these or additional sites identified by the Registrants, environmental agencies, or others, or whether such costs will be recoverable from third parties, including customers. Additional costs could have a material, unfavorable impact on the Registrants' financial statements.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 19 - Commitments and Contingencies\nMGP Sites (Exelon and the Utility Registrants). ComEd, PECO, BGE, and DPL have identified sites where former MGP or gas purification activities have or may have resulted in actual site contamination. For almost all of these sites, there are additional PRPs that may share responsibility for the ultimate remediation of each location.\n\u2022ComEd has 21 sites that are currently under some degree of active study and/or remediation. ComEd expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2026.\n\u2022PECO has 8 sites that are currently under some degree of active study and/or remediation. PECO expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2023.\n\u2022BGE has 4 sites that currently require some level of remediation and/or ongoing activity. BGE expects the majority of the remediation at these sites to continue through at least 2023.\n\u2022DPL has 1 site that is currently under study and the required cost at the site is not expected to be material.\nThe historical nature of the MGP and gas purification sites and the fact that many of the sites have been buried and built over, impacts the ability to determine a precise estimate of the ultimate costs prior to initial sampling and determination of the exact scope and method of remedial activity. Management determines its best estimate of remediation costs using all available information at the time of each study, including probabilistic and deterministic modeling for ComEd and PECO, and the remediation standards currently required by the applicable state environmental agency. Prior to completion of any significant clean up, each site remediation plan is approved by the appropriate state environmental agency.\nComEd, pursuant to an ICC order, and PECO, pursuant to settlements of natural gas distribution rate cases with the PAPUC, are currently recovering environmental remediation costs of former MGP facility sites through customer rates. While BGE and DPL do not have riders for MGP clean-up costs, they have historically received recovery of actual clean-up costs in distribution rates.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Registrants had accrued the following undiscounted amounts for environmental liabilities in Other current liabilities and Other deferred credits and other liabilities within their respective Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nCotter Corporation (Exelon and Generation). The EPA has advised Cotter Corporation (Cotter), a former ComEd subsidiary, that it is potentially liable in connection with radiological contamination at a site known as the West Lake Landfill in Missouri. In 2000, ComEd sold Cotter to an unaffiliated third-party. As part of the sale, ComEd agreed to indemnify Cotter for any liability arising in connection with the West Lake Landfill. In connection with Exelon\u2019s 2001 corporate restructuring, this responsibility to indemnify Cotter was transferred to Generation. Including Cotter, there are three PRPs participating in the West Lake Landfill remediation proceeding. Investigation by Generation has identified a number of other parties who also may be PRPs and could be liable to contribute to the final remedy. Further investigation is ongoing.\nIn September 2018, the EPA issued its Record of Decision (ROD) Amendment for the selection of a final remedy. The ROD Amendment modified the remedy previously selected by EPA in its 2008 ROD. While the 2008 ROD\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 19 - Commitments and Contingencies\nrequired only that the radiological materials and other wastes at the site be capped, the 2018 ROD Amendment requires partial excavation of the radiological materials in addition to the previously selected capping remedy. The ROD Amendment also allows for variation in depths of excavation depending on radiological concentrations. The EPA and the PRPs have entered into a Consent Agreement to perform the Remedial Design, which is expected to be completed by early 2022. In March 2019 the PRPs received Special Notice Letters from the EPA to perform the Remedial Action work. On October 8, 2019, Cotter (Generation\u2019s indemnitee) provided a non-binding good faith offer to conduct, or finance, a portion of the remedy, subject to certain conditions. The total estimated cost of the remedy, taking into account the current EPA technical requirements and the total costs expected to be incurred collectively by the PRPs in fully executing the remedy, is approximately $280 million, including cost escalation on an undiscounted basis, which would be allocated among the final group of PRPs. Generation has determined that a loss associated with the EPA\u2019s partial excavation and enhanced landfill cover remedy is probable and has recorded a liability, included in the table above, that reflects management\u2019s best estimate of Cotter\u2019s allocable share of the ultimate cost. Given the joint and several nature of this liability, the magnitude of Generation\u2019s ultimate liability will depend on the actual costs incurred to implement the required remedy as well as on the nature and terms of any cost-sharing arrangements with the final group of PRPs. Therefore, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost and Cotter's associated allocable share could differ significantly once these uncertainties are resolved, which could have a material impact on Exelon's and Generation's future financial statements.\nOne of the other PRPs has indicated it will be making a contribution claim against Cotter for costs that it has incurred to prevent the subsurface fire from spreading to those areas of the West Lake Landfill where radiological materials are believed to have been disposed. At this time, Exelon and Generation do not have sufficient information to assess this claim and therefore are unable to estimate a range of loss, if any. As such, no liability has been recorded for the potential contribution claim. It is reasonably possible, however, that resolution of this matter could have a material, unfavorable impact on Exelon\u2019s and Generation's financial statements.\nIn January 2018, the PRPs were advised by the EPA that it will begin an additional investigation and evaluation of groundwater conditions at the West Lake Landfill. In September 2018, the PRPs agreed to an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent for the performance by the PRPs of the groundwater Remedial Investigation (RI)/Feasibility Study (FS). The purpose of this RI/FS is to define the nature and extent of any groundwater contamination from the West Lake Landfill site and evaluate remedial alternatives. Generation estimates the undiscounted cost for the groundwater RI/FS to be approximately $30 million. Generation determined a loss associated with the RI/FS is probable and has recorded a liability, included in the table above, that reflects management\u2019s best estimate of Cotter\u2019s allocable share of the cost among the PRPs. At this time Generation cannot predict the likelihood that, or the extent to which any, remediation activities may be required and therefore cannot estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for response costs beyond those associated with the RI/FS component. It is reasonably possible, however, that resolution of this matter could have a material, unfavorable impact on Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s future financial statements.\nIn August 2011, Cotter was notified by the DOJ that Cotter is considered a PRP with respect to the government\u2019s clean-up costs for contamination attributable to low level radioactive residues at a former storage and reprocessing facility named Latty Avenue near St. Louis, Missouri. The Latty Avenue site is included in ComEd\u2019s (now Generation's) indemnification responsibilities discussed above as part of the sale of Cotter. The radioactive residues had been generated initially in connection with the processing of uranium ores as part of the U.S. Government\u2019s Manhattan Project. Cotter purchased the residues in 1969 for initial processing at the Latty Avenue facility for the subsequent extraction of uranium and metals. In 1976, the NRC found that the Latty Avenue site had radiation levels exceeding NRC criteria for decontamination of land areas. Latty Avenue was investigated and remediated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to funding under FUSRAP. Pursuant to a series of annual agreements since 2011, the DOJ and the PRPs have tolled the statute of limitations until August 31, 2021 so that settlement discussions can proceed. On August 3, 2020, the DOJ advised Cotter and the other PRPs that it is seeking approximately $90 million from all the PRPs and has directed that the PRPs must submit a good faith joint proposed settlement offer. Generation has determined that a loss associated with this matter is probable under its indemnification agreement with Cotter and has recorded an estimated liability, which is included in the table above.\nBenning Road Site (Exelon, Generation, PHI, and Pepco). In September 2010, PHI received a letter from EPA identifying the Benning Road site as one of six land-based sites potentially contributing to contamination of the lower Anacostia River. A portion of the site was formerly the location of a Pepco Energy Services electric generating facility, which was deactivated in June 2012. The remaining portion of the site consists of a Pepco\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 19 - Commitments and Contingencies\ntransmission and distribution service center that remains in operation. In December 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia approved a Consent Decree entered into by Pepco and Pepco Energy Services with the DOEE, which requires Pepco and Pepco Energy Services to conduct a RI/FS for the Benning Road site and an approximately 10 to 15-acre portion of the adjacent Anacostia River.\nSince 2013, Pepco and Pepco Energy Services (now Generation, pursuant to Exelon's 2016 acquisition of PHI) have been performing RI work and have submitted multiple draft RI reports to the DOEE. In September 2019, Pepco and Generation issued a draft \u201cfinal\u201d RI report which DOEE approved on February 3, 2020. Pepco and Generation are developing a FS to evaluate possible remedial alternatives for submission to DOEE. The Court has established a schedule for completion of the FS, and approval by the DOEE, by September 16, 2021. After completion and approval of the FS, DOEE will prepare a Proposed Plan for public comment and then issue a ROD identifying any further response actions determined to be necessary. PHI, Pepco, and Generation have determined that a loss associated with this matter is probable and have accrued an estimated liability, which is included in the table above.\nAnacostia River Tidal Reach (Exelon, PHI, and Pepco). Contemporaneous with the Benning Road site RI/FS being performed by Pepco and Generation, DOEE and the National Park Service have been conducting a separate RI/FS focused on the entire tidal reach of the Anacostia River extending from just north of the Maryland-District of Columbia boundary line to the confluence of the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers. The river-wide RI incorporated the results of the river sampling performed by Pepco and Pepco Energy Services as part of the Benning RI/FS, as well as similar sampling efforts conducted by owners of other sites adjacent to this segment of the river and supplemental river sampling conducted by DOEE\u2019s contractor. In April 2018, DOEE released a draft RI report for public review and comment. Pepco submitted written comments on the draft RI and participated in a public hearing.\nPepco has determined that it is probable that costs for remediation will be incurred and recorded a liability in the third quarter 2019 for management\u2019s best estimate of its share of those costs. On September 30, 2020, DOEE released its Interim ROD. The Interim ROD reflects an adaptive management approach which will require several identified \u201chot spots\u201d in the river to be addressed first while continuing to conduct studies and to monitor the river to evaluate improvements and determine potential future remediation plans. The adaptive management process chosen by DOEE is less intrusive, provides more long-term environmental certainty, is less costly, and allows for site specific remediation plans already underway, including the plan for the Benning Road site to proceed to conclusion. Pepco has concluded that incremental exposure remains reasonably possible, but management cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss beyond the amounts recorded, which are included in the table above.\nIn addition to the activities associated with the remedial process outlined above, CERCLA separately requires federal and state (here including Washington, D.C.) Natural Resource Trustees (federal or state agencies designated by the President or the relevant state, respectively, or Indian tribes) to conduct an assessment of any damages to natural resources within their jurisdiction as a result of the contamination that is being remediated. The Trustees can seek compensation from responsible parties for such damages, including restoration costs. During the second quarter of 2018, Pepco became aware that the Trustees are in the beginning stages of a Natural Resources Damages (NRD) assessment, a process that often takes many years beyond the remedial decision to complete. Pepco has concluded that a loss associated with the eventual NRD assessment is reasonably possible. Due to the very early stage of the assessment process, Pepco cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss.\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters\nAsbestos Personal Injury Claims (Exelon and Generation). Generation maintains a reserve for claims associated with asbestos-related personal injury actions in certain facilities that are currently owned by Generation or were previously owned by ComEd and PECO. The estimated liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis and exclude the estimated legal costs associated with handling these matters, which could be material.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, Exelon and Generation recorded estimated liabilities of approximately $89 million and $83 million, respectively, in total for asbestos-related bodily injury claims. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $25 million of this amount related to 261 open claims presented to Generation, while the remaining $64 million is for estimated future asbestos-related bodily injury claims anticipated to arise through 2055, based on actuarial assumptions and analyses, which are updated on an annual basis. On a quarterly\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 19 - Commitments and Contingencies\nbasis, Generation monitors actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments and evaluates whether adjustments to the estimated liabilities are necessary.\nIt is reasonably possible that additional exposure to estimated future asbestos-related bodily injury claims in excess of the amount accrued could have a material, unfavorable impact on Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s financial statements. However, management cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss beyond the amounts recorded.\nFund Transfer Restrictions (All Registrants). Under applicable law, Exelon may borrow or receive an extension of credit from its subsidiaries. Under the terms of Exelon\u2019s intercompany money pool agreement, Exelon can lend to, but not borrow from the money pool.\nUnder applicable law, Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, and ACE can pay dividends only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. A significant loss recorded at Generation, ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI, Pepco, DPL, or ACE may limit the dividends that these companies can distribute to Exelon.\nComEd has agreed in connection with financings arranged through ComEd Financing III that it will not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debt securities issued to ComEd Financing III; (2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the preferred trust securities of ComEd Financing III; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debt securities are issued. No such event has occurred.\nPECO has agreed in connection with financings arranged through PEC L.P. and PECO Trust IV that PECO will not declare dividends on any shares of its capital stock in the event that: (1) it exercises its right to extend the interest payment periods on the subordinated debentures, which were issued to PEC L.P. or PECO Trust IV; (2) it defaults on its guarantee of the payment of distributions on the Series D Preferred Securities of PEC L.P. or the preferred trust securities of PECO Trust IV; or (3) an event of default occurs under the Indenture under which the subordinated debentures are issued. No such event has occurred.\nBGE is subject to restrictions established by the MDPSC that prohibit BGE from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, BGE\u2019s equity ratio would be below 48% as calculated pursuant to the MDPSC\u2019s ratemaking precedents or (b) BGE\u2019s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. No such event has occurred.\nPepco is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by settlements approved in Maryland and the District of Columbia. Pepco is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, Pepco's equity ratio would be 48% as equity levels are calculated under the ratemaking precedents of the MDPSC and DCPSC or (b) Pepco\u2019s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by one of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. No such event has occurred.\nDPL is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by settlements approved in Delaware and Maryland. DPL is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, DPL's equity ratio would be 48% as equity levels are calculated under the ratemaking precedents of the DPSC and MDPSC or (b) DPL\u2019s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by one of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. No such event has occurred.\nACE is subject to certain dividend restrictions established by settlements approved in New Jersey. ACE is prohibited from paying a dividend on its common shares if (a) after the dividend payment, ACE's equity ratio would be 48% as equity levels are calculated under the ratemaking precedents of the NJBPU or (b) ACE's senior unsecured credit rating is rated by one of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade. ACE is also subject to a dividend restriction which requires ACE to obtain the prior approval of the NJBPU before dividends can be paid if its equity as a percent of its total capitalization, excluding securitization debt, falls below 30%. No such events have occurred.\nCity of Everett Tax Increment Financing Agreement (Exelon and Generation). On April 10, 2017, the City of Everett petitioned the Massachusetts Economic Assistance Coordinating Council (EACC) to revoke the 1999 tax increment financing agreement (TIF Agreement) relating to Mystic Units 8 and 9 on the grounds that the total investment in Mystic Units 8 and 9 materially deviates from the investment set forth in the TIF Agreement. On October 31, 2017, a three-member panel of the EACC conducted an administrative hearing on the City\u2019s petition. On November 30, 2017, the hearing panel issued a tentative decision denying the City\u2019s petition, finding that\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 19 - Commitments and Contingencies\nthere was no material misrepresentation that would justify revocation of the TIF Agreement. On December 13, 2017, the tentative decision was adopted by the full EACC. On January 12, 2018, the City filed a complaint in Massachusetts Superior Court requesting, among other things, that the court set aside the EACC\u2019s decision, grant the City\u2019s request to decertify the Project and the TIF Agreement, and award the City damages for alleged underpaid taxes over the period of the TIF Agreement. On January 8, 2020, the Massachusetts Superior Court affirmed the decision of the EACC denying the City's petition. The City had until March 9, 2020 to appeal the decision and did not. As a result, the decision is final and the case is resolved. It is reasonably possible that property taxes assessed in future periods, including those following the expiration of the TIF Agreement on June 30, 2020, could be material to Generation\u2019s financial statements.\nDeferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) and Related Matters (Exelon and ComEd). Exelon and ComEd received a grand jury subpoena in the second quarter of 2019 from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Illinois (USAO) requiring production of information concerning their lobbying activities in the State of Illinois. On October 4, 2019, Exelon and ComEd received a second grand jury subpoena from the USAO requiring production of records of any communications with certain individuals and entities. On October 22, 2019, the SEC notified Exelon and ComEd that it had also opened an investigation into their lobbying activities. On July 17, 2020, ComEd entered into a DPA with the USAO to resolve the USAO investigation. Under the DPA, the USAO filed a single charge alleging that ComEd improperly gave and offered to give jobs, vendor subcontracts, and payments associated with those jobs and subcontracts for the benefit of the Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives and the Speaker\u2019s associates, with the intent to influence the Speaker\u2019s action regarding legislation affecting ComEd\u2019s interests. The DPA provides that the USAO will defer any prosecution of such charge and any other criminal or civil case against ComEd in connection with the matters identified therein for a three-year period subject to certain obligations of ComEd, including payment to the U.S. Treasury of $200 million, with $100 million payable within thirty days of the filing of the DPA with the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and an additional $100 million within ninety days of such filing date. The payments were recorded within Operating and maintenance expense in Exelon\u2019s and ComEd\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in the second quarter of 2020. The payments will not be recovered in rates or charged to customers and ComEd will not seek or accept reimbursement or indemnification from any source other than Exelon. Exelon made equity contributions to ComEd of $200 million in 2020. On August 13, 2020, a motion was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by a ComEd customer and on behalf of ComEd customers seeking to enjoin ComEd from paying these funds to the U.S. Treasury and requiring the U.S. government to establish a victims\u2019 restitution fund from which the $200 million would be disbursed to ComEd customers. The motion was denied without prejudice on November 6, 2020 and ComEd submitted the $200 million payment to the U.S. Treasury. On January 6, 2021, the customer petitioned the Seventh Circuit for a writ of mandamus to seek review of the district court\u2019s ruling, but on January 8, 2021, the Seventh Circuit denied the petition. On January 22, 2021, the customer petitioned the Seventh Circuit for rehearing of its denial of his petition for a writ of mandamus. On February 5, 2021, the Seventh Circuit denied the petition for rehearing.\nExelon was not made a party to the DPA, and therefore the investigation by the USAO into Exelon\u2019s activities ended with no charges being brought against Exelon.\nThe SEC\u2019s investigation remains ongoing and Exelon and ComEd have cooperated fully and intend to continue to cooperate fully with the SEC. Exelon and ComEd cannot predict the outcome of the SEC investigation. No loss contingency has been reflected in Exelon's and ComEd's consolidated financial statements with respect to the SEC investigation, as this contingency is neither probable nor reasonably estimable at this time.\nSubsequent to Exelon announcing the receipt of the subpoenas, various lawsuits have been filed and various demand letters have been received related to the subject of the subpoenas, the conduct described in the DPA and the SEC's investigation, including:\n\u2022A putative class action lawsuit against Exelon and certain officers of Exelon and ComEd was filed in federal court in December 2019 alleging misrepresentations and omissions in Exelon\u2019s SEC filings related to ComEd\u2019s lobbying activities and the related investigations. The complaint was amended on September 16, 2020, to dismiss two of the original defendants and add other defendants, including ComEd. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss in November 2020. Briefing was completed on February 17, 2021.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 19 - Commitments and Contingencies\n\u2022A derivative shareholder lawsuit was filed against Exelon, its directors and certain officers of Exelon and ComEd in April 2020 alleging, among other things, breaches of fiduciary duties also purporting to relate to matters that are the subject of the subpoenas and the SEC investigation. The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed this derivative action without prejudice to refile on July 28, 2020.\n\u2022Three putative class action lawsuits against ComEd and Exelon were filed in Illinois state court in the third quarter of 2020 seeking restitution and compensatory damages on behalf of ComEd customers. These three state cases were consolidated into a single action in October of 2020. In addition, on November 2, 2020, the Citizens Utility Board (CUB) filed a motion to intervene in the state cases pursuant to an Illinois statute allowing CUB to intervene as a party or otherwise participate on behalf of utility consumers in any proceeding which affects the interest of utility consumers. On November 23, 2020, the court allowed CUB\u2019s intervention, but denied CUB\u2019s request to stay these cases. Plaintiffs subsequently filed a consolidated complaint, and ComEd and Exelon filed a motion to dismiss on jurisdictional and substantive grounds on January 11, 2021. Briefing on that motion is ongoing.\n\u2022Four putative class action lawsuits against ComEd and Exelon were filed in federal court in the third quarter of 2020 alleging, among other things, civil violations of federal racketeering laws. In addition, CUB filed a motion to intervene in these cases on October 22, 2020 which was granted on December 23, 2020. In addition, on December 2, 2020, the court appointed interim lead plaintiffs in the federal cases which consisted of counsel for three of the four federal cases. These plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on January 5, 2021. CUB also filed its own complaint against ComEd only on the same day. The remaining federal case, Potter, et al. v. Exelon et al, differed from the other lawsuits as it named additional individual defendants not named in the consolidated complaint. On January 10, 2021, the Potter plaintiffs filed a motion asking the court to clarify that their class action complaint against ComEd, Exelon and the individual named defendants remains in effect, notwithstanding the consolidated amended complaint, and asked the court to stay the Potter case. On January 21, 2021, the court determined that the appointed lead counsel had sole discretion to determine which parties to name as plaintiffs and defendants, and that the Potter plaintiffs have the option to opt-out of that class and file a separate, individual action against the defendants named in their original complaint. The Potter plaintiffs have until March 23, 2021 to make that decision.\n\u2022Four shareholders sent letters to the Exelon Board of Directors in 2020 demanding, among other things, that the Exelon Board of Directors investigate and address alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and other alleged violations by Exelon and ComEd officers and directors related to the conduct described in the DPA.\nNo loss contingencies have been reflected in Exelon\u2019s and ComEd\u2019s consolidated financial statements with respect to these matters, as such contingencies are neither probable nor reasonably estimable at this time.\nGeneral (All Registrants). The Registrants are involved in various other litigation matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. The Registrants maintain accruals for such losses that are probable of being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation. Management is sometimes unable to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss, particularly where (1) the damages sought are indeterminate, (2) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (3) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories. In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss.\n20. Shareholders' Equity (Exelon and Utility Registrants)\nComEd Common Stock Warrants\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 20 - Shareholders' Equity\nThe following table presents warrants outstanding to purchase ComEd common stock and shares of common stock reserved for the conversion of warrants. The warrants entitle the holders to convert such warrants into common stock of ComEd at a conversion rate of one share of common stock for three warrants.\nShare Repurchases\nThere currently is no Exelon Board of Director authority to repurchase shares. Any previous shares repurchased are held as treasury shares, at cost, unless cancelled or reissued at the discretion of Exelon\u2019s management.\nPreferred and Preference Securities\nThe following table presents Exelon, ComEd, PECO, BGE, Pepco, and ACE's shares of preferred securities authorized, none of which were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. There are no shares of preferred securities authorized for DPL.\n__________\n(a)Includes 799,979 shares of cumulative preferred stock and 2,000,000 of no-par preferred stock as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe following table presents ComEd's, BGE's, and ACE's preference securities authorized, none of which were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. There are no shares of preference securities authorized for Exelon, PECO, Pepco, and DPL.\n__________\n(a)Includes 4,600,000 shares of unclassified preference securities and 1,900,000 shares of previously redeemed preference securities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n21. Stock-Based Compensation Plans (All Registrants)\nStock-Based Compensation Plans\nExelon grants stock-based awards through its LTIP, which primarily includes performance share awards, restricted stock units, and stock options. At December 31, 2020, there were approximately 34 million shares authorized for issuance under the LTIP. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, exercised and distributed stock-based awards were primarily issued from authorized but unissued common stock shares.\nThe Registrants grant cash awards. The following table does not include expense related to these plans as they are not considered stock-based compensation plans under the applicable authoritative guidance.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 21 - Stock-Based Compensation Plans\nThe following table presents the stock-based compensation expense included in Exelon's and Generation's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The Utility Registrants' stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was not material.\nExelon receives a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the award on the exercise date for stock options and the distribution date for performance share awards and restricted stock units. For each award, throughout the requisite service period, Exelon recognizes the tax benefit related to compensation costs. The following table presents information regarding Exelon\u2019s realized tax benefit when distributed:\nPerformance Share Awards\nPerformance share awards are granted under the LTIP. The performance share awards are settled 50% in common stock and 50% in cash at the end of the three-year performance period, except for awards granted to vice presidents and higher officers that are settled 100% in cash if certain ownership requirements are satisfied.\nThe common stock portion of the performance share awards is considered an equity award and is valued based on Exelon's stock price on the grant date. The cash portion of the performance share awards is considered a liability award which is remeasured each reporting period based on Exelon\u2019s current stock price. As the value of the common stock and cash portions of the awards are based on Exelon\u2019s stock price during the performance period, coupled with changes in the total shareholder return modifier and expected payout of the award, the compensation costs are subject to volatility until payout is established.\nFor nonretirement-eligible employees, stock-based compensation costs are recognized over the vesting period of three years using the straight-line method. For performance share awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, the value of the performance shares is recognized ratably over the vesting period, which is the year of grant.\nExelon processes forfeitures as they occur for employees who do not complete the requisite service period.\nThe following table summarizes Exelon\u2019s nonvested performance share awards activity:\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 21 - Stock-Based Compensation Plans\n__________\n(a)Excludes 1,414,661 and 2,017,870 of performance share awards issued to retirement-eligible employees as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as they are fully vested.\n(b)Represents performance share awards that vested but were not distributed to retirement-eligible employees during 2020.\nThe following table summarizes the weighted average grant date fair value and the total fair value of performance share awards vested.\n__________\n(a)As of December 31, 2020, $13 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested performance shares are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 1.8 years.\nRestricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock units are granted under the LTIP with the majority being settled in a specific number of shares of common stock after the service condition has been met. The corresponding cost of services is measured based on the grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit issued.\nThe value of the restricted stock units is expensed over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. The requisite service period for restricted stock units is generally three to five years. However, certain restricted stock unit awards become fully vested upon the employee reaching retirement-eligibility. The value of the restricted stock units granted to retirement-eligible employees is either recognized ratably over the first six months in the year of grant if the employee reaches retirement eligibility prior to July 1st of the grant year or through the date of which the employee reaches retirement eligibility. Exelon processes forfeitures as they occur for employees who do not complete the requisite service period.\nThe following table summarizes Exelon\u2019s nonvested restricted stock unit activity:\n__________\n(a)Excludes 748,165 and 863,196 of restricted stock units issued to retirement-eligible employees as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as they are fully vested.\n(b)Represents restricted stock units that vested but were not distributed to retirement-eligible employees during 2020.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 21 - Stock-Based Compensation Plans\nThe following table summarizes the weighted average grant date fair value and the total fair value of restricted stock units vested.\n__________\n(a)As of December 31, 2020, $23 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock units are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 2.3 years.\nStock Options\nNon-qualified stock options to purchase shares of Exelon\u2019s common stock were granted through 2012 under the LTIP. The exercise price of the stock options is equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of option grant. Stock options will expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.\nAt December 31, 2020 all stock options were vested and there were no unrecognized compensation costs.\nThe following table presents information with respect to stock option activity:\n__________\n(a)Includes stock options issued to retirement eligible employees.\nThe following table summarizes additional information regarding stock options exercised:\n__________\n(a)The difference between the market value on the date of exercise and the option exercise price.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 22 - Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\n22.

Variable Interest Entities (Exelon, Generation, PHI, and ACE)\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, Exelon, Generation, PHI, and ACE collectively consolidated several VIEs or VIE groups for which the applicable Registrant was the primary beneficiary (see Consolidated VIEs below) and had significant interests in several other VIEs for which the applicable Registrant does not have the power to direct the entities\u2019 activities and, accordingly, was not the primary beneficiary (see Unconsolidated VIEs below). Consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs are aggregated to the extent that the entities have similar risk profiles.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 23 - Variable Interest Entities\nConsolidated VIEs\nThe table below shows the carrying amounts and classification of the consolidated VIEs\u2019 assets and liabilities included in the consolidated financial statements of Exelon, Generation, PHI, and ACE as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The assets, except as noted in the footnotes to the table below, can only be used to settle obligations of the VIEs. The liabilities, except as noted in the footnotes to the table below, are such that creditors, or beneficiaries, do not have recourse to the general credit of Exelon, Generation, PHI, and ACE.\n__________\n(a)Includes certain purchase accounting adjustments from the PHI merger not pushed down to ACE.\n(b)Generation entered into an agreement for the sale of a significant portion of Generation's solar business. As a result of this transaction, in the fourth quarter of 2020, Exelon and Generation reclassified the consolidated VIEs' solar assets and\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 23 - Variable Interest Entities\nliabilities as held for sale. Refer to Note 2 - Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions for additional information on the sale of the solar business.\n(c)Exelon's and Generation's balances include unrestricted assets for current unamortized energy contract assets of $22 million and $23 million, Property, plant, and equipment of $1 million and $20 million, non-current unamortized energy contract assets of $249 million and $250 million, and Assets held for sale of $9 million and $0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(d)Exelon's and Generation's balances include liabilities with recourse of $8 million and $3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Exelon's and Generation's consolidated VIEs consist of:\nCENG - On April 1, 2014, Generation, CENG, and subsidiaries of CENG executed the NOSA pursuant to which Generation conducts all activities associated with the operations of the CENG fleet and provides corporate and administrative services to CENG and the CENG fleet for the remaining life of the CENG nuclear plants as if they were a part of the Generation nuclear fleet, subject to the CENG member rights of EDF.\nEDF has the option to sell its 49.99% equity interest in CENG to Generation. On November 20, 2019, Generation received notice of EDF's intention to exercise the put option to sell its interest in CENG to Generation and the put automatically exercised on January 19, 2020. Refer to Note 2 - Mergers, Acquisitions, and Dispositions for additional information.\nExelon and Generation, where indicated, provide the following support to CENG:\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 23 - Variable Interest Entities\n\u2022Generation executed an Indemnity Agreement pursuant to which Generation agreed to indemnify EDF against third-party claims that may arise from any future nuclear incident (as defined in the Price-Anderson Act) in connection with the CENG nuclear plants or their operations. Exelon guarantees Generation\u2019s obligations under this Indemnity Agreement. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies for more details,\n\u2022Generation and EDF share in the $688 million of contingent payment obligations for the payment of contingent retrospective premium adjustments for the nuclear liability insurance, and\n\u2022Exelon has executed an agreement to provide up to $245 million to support the operations of CENG as well as a $165 million guarantee of CENG\u2019s cash pooling agreement with its subsidiaries.\nEGRP - EGRP is a collection of wind and solar project entities and some of these project entities are VIEs that are consolidated by EGRP. Generation owns a number of limited liability companies that build, own, and operate solar and wind power facilities some of which are owned by EGRP. While Generation or EGRP owns 100% of the solar entities and 100% of the majority of the wind entities, it has been determined that certain of the solar and wind entities are VIEs because the entities require additional subordinated financial support in the form of a parental guarantee of debt, loans from the customers in order to obtain the necessary funds for construction of the solar facilities, or the customers absorb price variability from the entities through the fixed price power and/or REC purchase agreements. Generation is the primary beneficiary of these solar and wind entities that qualify as VIEs because Generation controls the design, construction, and operation of the facilities. There is limited recourse to Generation related to certain solar and wind entities.\nIn 2017, Generation\u2019s interests in EGRP were contributed to and are pledged for the EGR IV non-recourse debt project financing structure. Refer to Note 17 - Debt and Credit Agreements for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Exelon's, PHI's and ACE's consolidated VIE consists of:\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nExelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s variable interests in unconsolidated VIEs generally include equity investments and energy purchase and sale contracts. For the equity investments, the carrying amount of the investments is reflected in Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets in Investments. For the energy purchase and sale contracts (commercial agreements), the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets that relate to their involvement with the VIEs are predominately related to working capital accounts and generally represent the amounts owed by, or owed to, Exelon and Generation for the deliveries associated with the current billing cycles under the commercial agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Exelon and Generation had significant unconsolidated variable interests in several VIEs for which Exelon or Generation, as applicable, was not the primary beneficiary. These interests include certain equity method investments and certain commercial agreements.\nCombined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data unless otherwise noted)\nNote 23 - Variable Interest Entities\nThe following table presents summary information about Exelon's and Generation\u2019s significant unconsolidated VIE entities:\n__________\n(a)These items represent amounts on the unconsolidated VIE balance sheets, not in Exelon\u2019s or Generation\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Subsequent Events (Exelon and Generation)\nPlanned Separation\nOn February 21, 2021, Exelon\u2019s Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Utility Registrants and Generation, creating two publicly traded companies. Under the separation plan, Exelon shareholders will retain their current shares of Exelon stock and receive a pro-rata distribution of shares of the new company\u2019s stock in a transaction that is expected to be tax-free to Exelon and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The actual number of shares to be distributed to Exelon shareholders will be determined prior to closing.\nExelon is targeting to complete the separation in the first quarter of 2022, subject to final approval by Exelon\u2019s Board of Directors, a Form 10 registration statement being declared effective by the SEC, regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of other conditions. The transaction is subject to approval by the FERC, NRC, and NYPSC, and receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS and tax opinion from Exelon\u2019s tax advisors. There can be no assurance that any separation transaction will ultimately occur or, if one does occur, of its terms or timing.\nImpacts of February 2021 Weather Events and Texas-based Generating Assets Outages\nBeginning on February 15, 2021, Generation\u2019s Texas-based generating assets within the ERCOT market, specifically Colorado Bend II, Wolf Hollow II, and Handley, experienced periodic outages as a result of historically severe cold weather conditions. In addition, those weather conditions drove increased demand for service, limited the availability of natural gas to fuel power plants, dramatically increased wholesale power prices, and also increased gas prices in certain regions. In response to the high demand and significantly reduced total generation on the system, ERCOT implemented load reductions to maintain the reliability of the grid and required the use of an administrative price cap of $9,000 per megawatt hour during load shedding events.\nExelon and Generation estimate the impact to their Net income for the first quarter of 2021 arising from these market and weather conditions to be approximately $560 million to $710 million. The estimated impact includes favorable results in certain regions within Generation\u2019s wholesale gas business. The ultimate impact to Exelon\u2019s and Generation\u2019s consolidated financial statements may be affected by a number of factors, including final settlement data, the impacts of customer and counterparty credit losses, any state sponsored solutions to address the financial challenges caused by the event, and litigation and contract disputes which may result.\nGeneration used a combination of commercial paper and letters of credit to manage collateral needs and has posted approximately $1.4 billion of collateral with ERCOT as of February 22, 2021. Generation continues to believe it has sufficient cash on hand and available capacity on its revolver, which was $2.4 billion as of February 22, 2021, to meet its liquidity requirements.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nAll Registrants-Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, each registrant\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of that registrant\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures\nrelated to the recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting of information in that registrant\u2019s periodic reports that it files with the SEC. These disclosure controls and procedures have been designed by each registrant to ensure that (a) information relating to that registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, that is required to be included in filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is accumulated and made known to that registrant\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, by other employees of that registrant and its subsidiaries as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (b) this information is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated, and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls could be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more people.\nAccordingly, as of December 31, 2020, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of each registrant concluded that such registrant\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives.\nAll Registrants-Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nEach registrant continually strives to improve its disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of its financial reporting and to maintain dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant. However, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, any of the Registrant's internal control over financial reporting, including no changes resulting from COVID-19. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Executive Overview for additional information on COVID-19.\nAll Registrants-Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is required to assess and report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. As a result of that assessment, management determined that there were no material weaknesses as of December 31, 2020 and, therefore, concluded that each registrant\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
