    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nAs of October 3, 2020, Flanigan\u2019s Enterprises, Inc., a Florida corporation, together with its subsidiaries (\u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d, \u201cours\u201d and \u201cus\u201d as the context requires), (i) operates 27 units, consisting of restaurants, package liquor stores and combination restaurants/package liquor stores that we either own or have operational control over and partial ownership in; and (ii) franchises an additional five units, consisting of two restaurants (one of which we operate) and three combination restaurants/package liquor stores. The table below provides information concerning the type (i.e. restaurant, package liquor store or combination restaurant/package liquor store) and ownership of the units (i.e. whether (i) we own 100% of the unit; (ii) the unit is owned by a limited partnership of which we are the sole general partner and/or have invested in; or (iii) the unit is franchised by us), as of October 3, 2020 and as compared to September 28, 2019. With the exception of \u201cThe Whale\u2019s Rib\u201d, a restaurant we operate but do not own, all of the restaurants operate under our service mark \u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d and all of the package liquor stores operate under our service marks \u201cBig Daddy\u2019s Liquors\u201d or \u201cBig Daddy\u2019s Wine & Liquors.\u201d\n____________________\nNotes:\n(1) During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019, our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19) was damaged by a fire which has caused it to be closed since the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019. Revenues and expenses from Store #19 for the time Store #19 was open during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019 (two (2) days) are immaterial, with the exception of payroll. Store #19 remains closed.\n(2) During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020, our new package liquor store located at 12776 N. Kendall Drive, Miami, Florida (Store #45) opened for business.\n(3) We operate a restaurant for one (1) franchisee. This unit is included in the table both as a franchised restaurant as well as a Company-operated restaurant.\nImpact of COVID-19\nIn March 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was declared a global pandemic and a National Public Health Emergency. The novel coronavirus pandemic and related \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders and other governmental mandates relating thereto (collectively, \u201cCOVID-19\u201d) adversely affected and will, in all likelihood continue to adversely affect, our restaurant operations and financial results for the foreseeable future. Due to COVID-19, from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020, we ceased all dining and bar services at all of our restaurants, limiting service to take-out and delivery only of food, and implemented reduced hours at our retail package liquor stores. From mid-May 2020 through the beginning of July 2020, there was a gradual elimination of restrictions on our restaurant operations, permitting us to, among other things, provide dining for outdoor seating patrons with appropriate social distancing and provide dining for indoor patrons at up to 50% capacity (depending on the location of the restaurant), but with no bar service and increased operating hours at our package liquor stores. From the beginning of July 2020 through the beginning of September 2020, we ceased dine-in service at all of our Miami-Dade County, Florida restaurants, (two Company-owned and six limited partnership owned restaurants). Since the beginning of September 2020, we have been offering both food and bar options at all of our restaurants, including those located in Miami-Dade County, Florida, with appropriate social distancing and dine-in service at up to 100% capacity, including outdoor dining.\nDue to COVID-19, we implemented (i) certain cost cutting measures including material layoffs at our restaurants and reduced corporate personnel salaries; and (ii) a number of changes to our operations such as the establishment of an in-house delivery service and an adjustment to our traditional staffing model to meet customer demand. We have been in regular contact with our suppliers and while to date we have not experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain, we could see future disruptions should the impacts of COVID-19 extend for a considerable amount of time. To support our employees, we have implemented work from home support, increased sanitization of high touch, high traffic areas in our restaurants, retail package liquor stores and corporate offices, provided personal protective equipment for our employees and increased the frequency of personal hygiene practices. From March 29, 2020 through May 9, 2020, the salaries of all our non-executive corporate office personnel were reduced by 20%, the base salaries of our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer were each reduced by 50% and our Chief Executive Officer waived his base salary, representing salary savings of approximately $135,000 during this period. Our employee headcount as of fiscal year end 2020 was 1,804 persons reduced from 1,870 persons as of our fiscal year end 2019.\nIn addition and also due to COVID-19, we did not make any quarterly distributions to our limited partners for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. For each of the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020, we made quarterly distributions to our limited partners equal to one-half (\u00bd) of the amounts that would have been distributed for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year end 2020, the United States government passed a $2.0 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) designed primarily to help keep businesses running during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act included provisions for certain deductions and tax credits, filing deadline extensions, filing payment deadlines and making available certain grant money to assist businesses. This CARES ACT allowed us to take advantage of credits, deferments, and deductions, and loans from an unrelated third party lender pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP Loans\u201d) (described below) during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020. As a result, during the third and fourth quarter of 2020, we reversed certain of our cost cutting measures, including (i) reinstating employees laid off at our restaurants in anticipation of resuming dine-in service, (ii)restoring corporate personnel and executive salaries and (iii) paying prior salary reductions.\nWe do not believe COVID-19 has had a material adverse effect on our access to supplies or labor, although there can be no assurance that there will not be a significant adverse impact on our supply chain or access to labor in the future. We are actively monitoring our food suppliers to assess how they are managing their operations to mitigate supply flow and food safety risks. To ensure we mitigate potential supply availability risk, we are building additional inventory back stock levels when appropriate and we have also identified alternative supply sources in key product categories including but not limited to food, sanitation and safety supplies.\nAdditional information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business and the CARES Act is set forth within this Part I, Part II",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. These risks should be considered carefully with the uncertainties described below, and all other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial and therefore not referenced herein, may also become material and may harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nCertain statements in this report contain forward-looking information. In general, forward-looking statements include estimates of future revenues, cash flow, capital expenditures, or other financial items and assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements reflect management\u2019s current expectations regarding future events and use words such as \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d and other similar terminology. These statements speak only as of the date they were made and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Several factors, many beyond our control, could cause actual results to differ materially from management\u2019s expectations. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict when they may arise or how they may affect us. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this report as a result of new information, future events or other developments, except as required by applicable laws and regulations.\nThe Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic Has Had A Significant Impact On Our Operations Since March 2020 And Could Materially And Adversely Affect Our Future Business And Financial Results.\nThe global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19 virus) has and will continue to materially and adversely affect our restaurant business for what may be a prolonged period of time. This damage and disruption has resulted from events and factors that were impossible for us to predict and are beyond our control. In the United States, as well as globally, individuals are being encouraged to practice social distancing, restricted from gathering in groups, and in some areas are restricted from non-essential movements outside of their homes. In compliance with government directives from time to time, we temporarily (i) shifted our restaurant operations to a take-out or delivery only operating model; (ii) reduced the operating hours of our retail package stores; (iii) laid off a significant number of employees; and (iv) substantially modified our corporate operations to comply with social distancing requirements. As a result, and despite experiencing increased sales and traffic at certain of our retail package liquor stores, these changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic materially adversely affected our results of operations for our fiscal year 2020 and will, in all likelihood, impact our results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition for our fiscal year 2021, particularly if further government directives are put in place for a significant amount of time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on the economy in general, globally, nationally and locally, could also adversely affect our guests\u2019 financial condition, resulting in reduced spending at our restaurants and package liquor stores. The COVID-19 pandemic and these responses have affected and will continue to adversely affect our guest traffic, sales and operating costs and we cannot predict how long the pandemic will last or what other government responses may occur. Moreover, once restrictions are lifted, it is unclear whether guests will be comfortable dining out and, if so, how quickly guests will return to our restaurants, which may be a function of continued concerns over safety and/or depressed consumer sentiment due to adverse economic conditions, including job losses, and other factors that are beyond our control. Any failure of consumers to return to pre-pandemic dining patterns could have a long-term material adverse impact on us and our future prospects.\nThe equity markets in the United States have been extremely volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic and our stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so. If the business interruptions caused by COVID-19 continue indefinitely or last longer than we expect, we may need to seek other sources of liquidity. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant disruption and extreme volatility in global capital markets and is adversely affecting the availability of liquidity generally in the credit markets, and there can be no guarantee that additional liquidity will be readily available on favorable terms, especially the longer the COVID-19 pandemic lasts, or available at all. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, our Board of Directors voted to cancel a previously declared cash dividend due to uncertainty surrounding the duration of closures of our dining rooms and other restrictions mandated by state and local governments in response to COVID-19. Additionally, certain of our restaurants have been further disrupted when an employee has been diagnosed with COVID-19 or exposed to a person with a confirmed positive diagnosis of COVID-19. In the event an employee has been diagnosed with COVID-19, our policy requires quarantine of some or all of a restaurant\u2019s or store\u2019s employees and disinfection of the restaurant or store facilities. Additionally, if an employee has direct contact with a friend or family member with a confirmed positive diagnosis of COVID-19, such employee must exclude himself or herself from work for a certain period of time. If a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, our operations will be negatively impacted, potentially materially adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. If an outbreak is traced to one or more of our locations, it could impact our reputation and subject us to legal claims.\nWe have not experienced any significant issues related to suppliers; however, our suppliers could be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If our suppliers\u2019 employees are unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, or if the supply chain is disrupted for any other reason such as travel limitations and other restrictions on commerce, we could face shortages of food items or other supplies at our restaurants and our operations and sales could be adversely impacted by such supply interruptions.\nConsidering the significant uncertainty as to our ability to increase sales to levels we achieved before the COVID-19 pandemic based on aforementioned uncertainties and other known and unknown risks related to the pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1 - Business, Part II, Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discussions on Liquidity for further information. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, may also precipitate or exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A - Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional effects may arise that we are not presently aware of or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted.\nOur Sales and Profit Growth Could Be Adversely Affected If Comparable Restaurant Sales Increases Are Less Than We Expect, and We May Not Successfully Increase Comparable Restaurant Sales or They May Decrease.\nWhile future sales growth will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants, changes in comparable restaurant sales (which represent the change in period-over-period sales for restaurants) will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth. This is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can have a significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases. There is no assurance that comparable restaurant sales will increase in fiscal year 2021 due to, among other things, ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty.\nOur ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 perceptions of the Flanigan\u2019s brand;\n\u00b7 competition, especially from an increasing number of competitors in the fast casual segment of the restaurant industry and from other restaurants whose strategies overlap ours, as well as from grocery stores, meal kit delivery services and other dining options;\n\u00b7 executing our strategies effectively, including our marketing and branding strategies;\n\u00b7 changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending;\n\u00b7 our ability to increase menu prices without adversely affecting our existing business;\n\u00b7 weather, natural disasters and other factors limiting access to our restaurants; and\n\u00b7 changes in government regulation that may impact customer perceptions of our food.\nAs a result it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative. A number of these factors are beyond our control and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustain comparable restaurant sales increases.\nHigh Unemployment, Instability in the Housing Market, High Energy and Food Costs and General Economic Uncertainty Could Result in a Decline in Consumer Discretionary Spending That Would Materially Affect our Financial Performance.\nDining out is a discretionary expense. Factors that affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining, such as changes in general economic conditions (including national, regional and local economic conditions), discretionary spending patterns, employment levels, instability in the housing market, and high energy and food costs may have a material adverse effect on us. If economic conditions worsen, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nIntense Competition In The Restaurant And Package Liquor Store Industry Could Prevent Us From Increasing Or Sustaining Our Revenues And Profitability.\nThe restaurant and package liquor store industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and location and many restaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-established competitors with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitors are well established in the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores or where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally, other companies may develop restaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts.\nAny inability to compete successfully with the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability and will result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We may also need to modify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular new restaurant formats or store concepts that may develop in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing these modifications or that these modifications will not reduce our profitability.\nNew Information Or Attitudes Regarding Diet And Health Could Result In Changes In Regulations And Consumer Eating Habits That Could Adversely Affect Our Revenues.\nRegulations and consumer eating habits may change because of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. These changes may include regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items at our restaurants. For example, a number of states, counties and cities are enacting menu-labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritional information available to guests or restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. The success of our restaurant operations is dependent, in part, upon our ability to respond effectively to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations and to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or delete certain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to our menu offerings, it could materially affect customer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues.\nAdverse Public Or Medical Opinions About Health Effects Of Consuming Our Products As Well As Negative Publicity About Us, Our Restaurants And/or Package Liquor Stores And About Others Across The Food And Liquor Industry Supply Chain, Whether Or Not Accurate, Could Negatively Affect Us.\nRestaurant operators have received more scrutiny from regulators and health organizations in recent years relating to the health effects of consuming certain products. An unfavorable report on the products we use in our menu, the size of our portions or the consumption of those items could influence the demand for our offerings. In addition, adverse publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, of food quality issues, illness, injury, health concerns, or operating issues stemming from a single restaurant, a limited number of restaurants, restaurants operated by others or generally in the food supply chain could be damaging to the restaurant industry overall and specifically harm our reputation. A decrease in guest traffic because of these types of health concerns or negative publicity could materially harm our results of operations.\nOur Inability To Successfully And Sufficiently Raise Menu Prices Could Result In A Decline In Profitability.\nWe utilize menu price increases to help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurance arrangements, construction, utilities and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are not accepted by consumers and reduce guest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could be negatively affected. However, we have not experienced any adverse effects from past menu price increases.\nIncreases in Food Costs, Raw Materials and Other Supplies and Services May Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Financial Performance.\nOur operating margins depend on, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and beverage costs, utilities and other supplies and services. We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term agreements for our principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we are currently unable to contract for extended periods of time for certain of our commodities. Consequently, these commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations due to factors such as changes in demand patterns, increases in the cost of key inputs, fuel costs, weather and other market conditions outside of our control. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation. Our suppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higher minimum wage and benefit costs, and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us.\nOur Business Could Be Materially Adversely Affected If We Are Unable To Expand In A Timely And Profitable Manner.\nTo grow successfully, we must open new restaurants and/or package liquor stores on a timely and profitable basis. We have experienced delays in restaurant and/or package liquor store openings from time to time and may experience delays in the future. During our fiscal year 2020, we continued developing our new restaurant in Sunrise, Florida. During our fiscal year 2019, we developed a new package liquor store in Miami, Florida (Store #45).\nOur ability to open and profitably operate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations, the availability of limited partner investors or other means to raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors, the availability of construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets, variations in labor and building material costs, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount of time. If we are unable to manage these risks successfully, we will face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues which will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nChanges In Customer Preferences For Casual Dining Styles Could Adversely Affect Financial Performance.\nChanging customer preferences, tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees, side dishes and desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining. A change from this dining style may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur Success Depends Substantially on the Value of our Brands and our Reputation for Offering Guests a Satisfactory Experience.\nWe believe we have built a reasonably strong reputation for the predictability of our menu items, as part of the experience that guests enjoy in our restaurants. We believe we must protect and grow the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodes consumer trust in or affinity for our brands could be harmful to us. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in food quality, service or ambiance, or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer.\nOur Marketing And Advertising Strategies May Not Be Successful, Which Could Adversely Impact Our Business.\nFrom time to time, we introduce new advertising campaigns and media strategies. If our advertising campaign and new media strategies do not resonate with customers in the manner we hope, they may not result in increased sales, but would still increase our expenses. We will continue to invest in marketing and advertising strategies that we believe will attract customers or increase their connection with our brand. If these marketing and advertising investments do not drive increased restaurant and/or package store sales, the expense associated with these programs will adversely impact our financial results, and we may not generate the levels of comparable sales we expect.\nLabor Shortages, An Increase In Labor Costs, Or Inability To Attract Employees Could Harm Our Business.\nOur employees are essential to our operations and our ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to our customers. If we are unable to attract and retain enough qualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience, our results may be negatively affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs.\nIncreases In Employee Minimum Wages By The Federal Or State Government Could Adversely Affect Business.\nCertain of our Company employees are paid wages that relate to federal and state minimum wage rates. Increases in the minimum wage rates, such as annual cost of living increases in the State of Florida minimum wage, may significantly increase our labor costs. In addition, since our business is labor-intensive, shortages in the labor pool or other inflationary pressure could increase labor costs, which could harm our financial performance.\nDue To Our Geographic Locations, Restaurants Are Subject To Climate Conditions That Could Affect Operations.\nAll but one (1) of our restaurants and package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida. During hurricane season, (June 1 through November 30 each year), our restaurants and/or package liquor stores may face harsh weather associated with hurricanes and tropical storms. These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficult for customers to visit our restaurants and package liquor stores or may necessitate the closure of the stores and restaurants for a period of time. If customers are unable to visit our restaurants and/or package liquor stores, our sales and operating results may be negatively affected.\nIf We Were to Experience Widespread Difficulty Renewing Existing Leases on Favorable Terms, Our Revenue or Occupancy Costs Could be Adversely Affected.\nMost of the properties on which we operate restaurants are leased from third parties, and some of our leases are due for renewal or extension options in the next several years. Some leases expire without any renewal options. While we currently expect to pursue the renewal of substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases, any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases, or any substantial increase in rents associated with lease renewals, could adversely impact us. If we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties in renewing leases, we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants. Substantial increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs, reducing our restaurant margins.\nDue To Our Geographic Locations, We May Not Be Able To Acquire Windstorm Insurance Coverage Or Adequate Windstorm Insurance Coverage At A Reasonable Rate.\nDue to the anticipated active hurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, we may not be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage for our restaurant and package liquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates. If we are unable to obtain windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, then we will be self-insured for all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, which may have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations.\nInability To Attract And Retain Customers Could Affect Results Of Operations.\nWe take pride in our ability to attract and retain customers, however, if we do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for our customers, they may not return and results may be negatively affected.\nA Failure To Comply With Governmental Regulations Could Harm Our Business And Our Reputation.\nWe are subject to regulation by federal agencies and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, building, zoning, safety, fire and other departments relating to the development and operation of restaurants. These regulations include matters relating to the following:\n\u00b7 the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages;\n\u00b7 employment;\n\u00b7 building construction and access;\n\u00b7 zoning requirements; and\n\u00b7 the environment.\nOur facilities are licensed and subject to regulation under state and local fire, health and safety codes. The construction and remodeling of restaurants will be subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We may not be able to obtain necessary licenses or other approvals on a cost-effective and timely basis in order to construct and develop restaurants in the future.\nVarious federal and state labor laws govern our operations and our relationship with our employees, minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, fringe benefit and work authorization requirements. In particular, we are subject to federal immigration regulations. Given the location of many of our restaurants, even if we operate those restaurants in strict compliance with federal immigration requirements, our employees may not all meet federal work authorization or residency requirements, which could lead to disruptions in our work force.\nOur business can be adversely affected by negative publicity resulting from, among other things, complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, food-borne illness or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Unfavorable publicity could negatively impact public perception of our brands.\nWe are required to comply with the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government, states and municipalities where our restaurants are located. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require applications to state authorities and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities for a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of the restaurants, including minimum age of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations, our licenses may be revoked and we may be forced to terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants.\nThe Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (the \u201cADA\u201d) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. We are required to comply with the ADA and regulations relating to accommodating the needs of disabled persons in connection with the construction of new facilities and with significant renovations of existing facilities.\nFailure to comply with these and other regulations could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe May Face Liability Under Dram Shop Statutes.\nOur sale of alcoholic beverages subjects us to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes, which allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage, or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. There are currently no \u201cdram shop\u201d claims pending against us. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Government Regulation\u201d for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply.\nWe May Face Instances of Food Borne Illness.\nIn years past, several nationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by E.coli contained in fresh spinach, which is not included in any of the items on our menu, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of \u201cmad cow\u201d disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (such as, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference. As a result, our sales could decline.\nInstances of food-borne illnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could also result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry, which could adversely affect sales. If we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or other key aspects of the dining experience we offer, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes, and may not be able to attract enough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. If our guests become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants, could materially harm our business.\nIf We Are Unable To Protect Our Customers\u2019 Credit Card Data, We Could Be Exposed To Data Loss, Litigation, And Liability, And Our Reputation Could Be Significantly Harmed.\nIn connection with credit card sales, we transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks. Although we use private networks, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connection with credit card sales, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. If a person is able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, and liability, and could seriously disrupt our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation.\nIf We Experience a Significant Failure in or Interruption of Certain Key Information Technology Systems, our Business could be Adversely Impacted.\nWe use a variety of applications and systems to manage the flow of information securely within each of our restaurants and within our centralized corporate infrastructure. The services available within our systems and applications include restaurant and store operations, supply chain, inventory, scheduling, training, human capital management, financial tools and data protection services. The restaurant and store structure is based primarily on a point-of-sale system that operates locally and is integrated with other functions necessary to operations. It records sales transactions, receives out of store orders and authorizes, batches and transmits credit card transactions. The system also allows employees to enter time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports. Select information that is captured from this system at each restaurant or store is collected in the central corporate infrastructure, which enables management to continually monitor operating results. Our ability to manage efficiently and effectively our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these and other systems and our operations depend substantially on the availability of our point-of-sale system and related networks and applications. These systems may be vulnerable to attacks or outages from security breaches, viruses and other disruptive problems, as well as from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Any failure of these systems to operate effectively, whether from security breaches, maintenance problems, upgrades or transitions to new platforms, or other factors could result in interruptions to or delays in our restaurant or other operations, adversely impacting the restaurant or store experience for our customers or negatively impacting our ability to manage our business. If our information technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures, or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any losses that we may incur, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses.\nThe Effect of Recent Changes to U.S. Healthcare Laws May Increase Our Healthcare Costs and Negatively Impact Our Financial Results.\nWe offer eligible full-time employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by the Company. For various reasons, many of our eligible employees currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans. However, under the comprehensive U.S. health care reform law enacted in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, certain provisions, including, the employer mandate, may increase our labor costs significantly. In general, implementing the requirements of the Affordable Care Act is likely to impose additional administrative costs on us. The costs and other effects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determined with certainty, but they may have a material adverse effect on our financial and operating results.\nGovernmental Regulation in One or More of the Following Areas May Adversely Affect Our Existing and Future Operations and Results, Including by Harming Our Ability to Open New Restaurants or Increasing Our Operating Costs.\nEmployment and Immigration Regulations\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, including wage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, healthcare, family leave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers\u2019 compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non-compliance. For example, historically, lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime. We could suffer losses from and we incur legal costs to defend, these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant. In addition, several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases, paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changes could increase our labor costs. Changes in U.S. healthcare laws could also adversely impact us if they result in significant new welfare and benefit costs or increased compliance expenses.\nWe also are subject to being audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements. From time to time, the State of Florida considers adopting new state immigration laws and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from time to time consider or implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs as well. Changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we require all workers to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. We currently participate in the \u201cE-Verify\u201d program, an Internet-based, free program run by the U.S. government to verify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company. However, use of E-Verify does not guarantee that we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively affects our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of employees would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws. Our reputation and financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors.\nOn the other hand, in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to have a disparate impact on a protected class, such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants, we could be found to be in violation of anti-discrimination laws. We could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity related to work authorization compliance, anti-discrimination compliance, or both, that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Moreover, our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants.\nAdditionally, while we do not currently have any unionized employees, union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of other restaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increase and our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired. Potential changes in labor laws, including the possible passage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize, could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs, reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture.\nAmericans with Disabilities Act and Similar State Laws\nWe are subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. We have incurred legal fees in connection with ADA-related complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural features, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws. The expenses associated with these modifications or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ADA or similar state laws, could be material.\nNutrition and Food Regulation\nIn recent years there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casual segments have been a particular focus. For example, the State of California, New York City and a number of other jurisdictions around the U.S. have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menus and/or make other nutritional information available and nation-wide nutrition disclosure requirements included in the U.S. health care reform law went into effect as of December 1, 2015. These nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slow customers as they select their food and beverage choices decreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customers\u2019 buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales.\nPrivacy/Cybersecurity\nWe are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as part of some of our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. If our security and information systems are compromised or if we otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees.\nLocal Licensure, Zoning and Other Regulation\nEach of our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, food and workplace safety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.\nEnvironmental Laws\nWe are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances relating to our operations. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations. We cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future, how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws.\nWe Could Be Party To Litigation That Could Adversely Affect Us By Distracting Management, Increasing Our Expenses or Subjecting Us to Material Money Damages and Other Remedies.\nWe could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies. We could become subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, including wages, work hours, overtime, vacation and family leave, discrimination, wrongful termination and similar matters, and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters. Our customers could file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants or that we have problems with food quality, operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices. The restaurant industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure and advertising practices.\nRegardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable for such claims, they may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A significant judgment for any claims against us could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations, whether directed at us or at fast casual or quick-service restaurants generally, may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects, which in turn could adversely affect our results.\nOur Success May Depend on the Continued Service and Availability of Key Personnel.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President, James Flanigan, has been the principal architect of our business strategy since 2002. August Bucci and Jeffrey Kastner, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, have also served with us since 2002 in the case of Mr. Bucci and since 2004 in the case of Mr. Kastner, and much of our growth has occurred under their direction as well. We believe our executive officers have created an employee culture, food culture and business strategy at our company that has been critical to our success and that may be difficult to replicate under another management team. We also believe that it may be difficult to locate and retain executive officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision. If our company culture were to deteriorate following a change in leadership, or if a new management team were to be unsuccessful in executing our strategy or were to change important elements of our current strategy, our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted.\nWe are Exposed to Risks Related to Cybersecurity.\nAlthough we maintain systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security. Any material incidents could cause us to experience financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us and increased expenses related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material incidents. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. If our information security systems or data are compromised in a material way, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may incur financial losses and we may incur costs to remediate possible harm and/or to pay fines or take other action which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIf There is a Material Failure in our Information Technology Systems, Our Business Operations and Profits could be Negatively Affected and our Systems may be Inadequate to Support our Future Growth Strategies.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems in all aspects of our operations including our restaurant point-of sale systems, financial systems, marketing programs, employee engagement, supply chain management, cyber-security, and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage and run our business depends on the reliability and capacity of our information technology systems, including technology services and systems for which we contract from third parties. These systems and services may be insufficient to effectively manage and run our business. These systems and our business needs will continue to evolve and require upgrading and maintenance over time, consequently requiring significant future commitments of resources and capital.\nMoreover, these technology services and systems, communication systems, and electronic data could be subject or vulnerable to damage or interruption from hurricanes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, loss of data, data breaches, or other attempts to harm our systems. A failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure information technology network for any of the above reasons could result in interruption and delays in customer services, adversely affect our reputation, and negatively impact our results of operations.\nActs of Violence at or Threatened Against our Restaurants or the Centers in which they are Located, including Active Shooter Situations and Terrorism, Could Unfavorably Impact our Restaurant Sales, which could Materially Adversely Affect our Financial Performance.\nAny act of violence at or threatened against our restaurants or the centers in which they are located, including active shooter situations and terrorist activities, may result in restricted access to our restaurants and/or restaurant closures in the short-term and, in the long-term, may cause our customers and staff to avoid our restaurants. Any such situation could adversely impact customer traffic and make it more difficult to staff our restaurants fully, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, such as active shooter or future terrorist attacks military and governmental responses, and the protest of future wars, may result in negative changes to economic conditions likely resulting in decreased consumer spending. Additionally, decreases in consumer discretionary spending may impact the frequency with which our customers choose to dine out at restaurants or the amount they spend on meals while dining out at restaurants, thereby adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. A decrease in consumer discretionary spending may also adversely affect our ability to achieve the benefit of planned menu price increases to help preserve our operating margins.\nSocial Media Impact on Customer Perceptions of our Brand.\nThe considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that may be generated. The adverse impact of publicity on customers\u2019 perception of us could have a further negative impact on our sales. If the impact of any such publicity is particularly long-lasting, the value of our brand may suffer and our ability to grow could be diminished.\nOur digital business, which has become an increasing significant part of our business, is subject to risks.\nPrimarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue derived from digital orders, which includes delivery and customer pickup has increased substantially. While we are uncertain as to whether this business will continue to increase and/or be significant, we have implemented technology, targeted advertising and promotions and to some extent remodeled our restaurants, to accommodate the growth of our digital business. If we do not continue to grow our digital business, it may be difficult for us to recoup these costs or achieve our sales growth potential. We rely on third-party delivery services to fulfill package store delivery orders, and the ordering and payment platforms used by these third-parties, or online ordering system, could be interrupted by technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks or other factors, which could adversely impact sales through these channels and negatively impact our reputation. Additionally, our delivery partners are responsible for order fulfillment and errors or failures to make timely deliveries could cause guests to stop ordering from us. The third-party delivery business is competitive, with a number of players competing for market share and delivery drivers. If the third-party delivery services that we utilize cease or curtail operations, increase their fees, or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors, our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted.",

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nAs a Smaller Reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this Item 1B.",
    "item_2": "ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.\nOur operations are conducted primarily on leased property with the exception of the following:\n(i) a 10,000 square foot stand-alone building located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida that we purchased in December, 1999, which since April 2001 has housed our corporate headquarters;\n(ii) a 4,600 square foot stand-alone building located in Hallandale, Florida that we purchased in July 2006 and which since September 1968 has housed our Hallandale, Florida Company-owned combination restaurant and package liquor store (Store #31);\n(iii) a 4,120 square foot stand-alone building in Hollywood, Florida we constructed in November 2003, upon real property we acquired in September 2001 pursuant to a 25 year ground lease interest, (a portion of this building is leased to an unaffiliated third party), and which since November 2003 has housed our Hollywood, Florida Company-owned package liquor store (Store #4);\n(iv) a 4,500 square foot stand-alone building located in Hollywood, Florida that we purchased in October 2009 and which housed our Hollywood, Florida Company-owned combination restaurant and package liquor store (Store #19) from March, 1972 until it was destroyed by fire on October 2, 2018 and the vacant parcel of real property adjacent thereto which we purchased in February 2015;\n(v) a 4,600 square foot stand-alone building located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida that we purchased in August 2010 and which since December, 1968 has housed our Fort Lauderdale, Florida Company-owned restaurant (Store #22);\n(vi) a 5,100 square foot stand-alone building in North Miami, Florida that we purchased in November 2010; the two parcels of real property adjacent thereto which we purchased in December 2012, one of which is contiguous to the real property and which we previously leased for non-exclusive parking and the vacant parcel of real property adjacent to the two parcels of real property which we purchased in March 2017. The stand-alone building housed our North Miami, Florida Company-owned combination restaurant and package liquor store, (Store #20), from July, 1968 until June 2017 when the package liquor store was re-located to a new building we constructed on the adjacent property;\n(vii) a 23,678 square foot two building shopping center in Miami, Florida that we purchased in November 2010: (A) one stand-alone building, approximately 18,828 square feet, (i) houses our recently opened (October 2019) new package liquor store and (ii) is otherwise leased to ten unaffiliated third party retailers; and (B) the second stand-alone building, approximately 4,850 square feet, has housed our Kendall, Florida based restaurant since April 4, 2000, which is owned by our affiliated limited partnership (Store #70);\n(viii) a 6,400 square foot building in Fort Lauderdale, Florida that we purchased in February 2014, 4,000 square feet of which has been leased to a related franchisee (Store #15) since April 1, 1997 and the balance (2,400 square feet) of which we use as storage. In August 2018 we purchased the real property and quadraplex adjacent thereto to insure adequate parking for the franchised restaurant in the future, if needed;\n(ix) a 6,000 square foot stand-alone building in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and the vacant real property diagonally adjacent that we purchased in October 2015, which we use as office and warehouse space, covered parking for our food truck and as a storage yard; and\n(x) a 4,600 square foot stand-alone building located in North Lauderdale, Florida that we purchased subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2020 and which since April 1971 has housed our Company owned combination restaurant and package liquor store (Store #40).\nAll of our units require periodic refurbishing in order to remain competitive. We have budgeted $950,000 for our refurbishing program for fiscal year 2021. See Item 7, \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for discussion of the amounts spent in fiscal year 2020.\nThe following table summarizes information related to the properties upon which our operations are conducted:\n---------------------------------------------\n(1) Franchised by Company.\n(2) Lease assigned to franchisee.\n(3) In 1974, we sold and assigned the underlying ground lease to unaffiliated third parties and simultaneously subleased it back. We have re-purchased from the unaffiliated third parties and currently own 52% of the underlying ground lease, as well as the sublease agreement. As a result, we pay all rent due under the ground lease, but only 48% of the rent due under the sublease agreement.\n(4) Effective December 1, 1998, we purchased the Management Agreement to operate the franchised restaurant for the franchisee.\n(5) Ground lease executed by us on September 25, 2001. We constructed a 4,120 square foot building, of which 1,978 square feet is used by us for the operation of a package liquor store and the other 2,142 square feet is subleased to an unaffiliated third party as retail space. The package liquor store opened for business on November 17, 2003.\t\n(6) During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012, our wholly owned subsidiary, Flanigan\u2019s Calusa Center, LLC, closed on the purchase of a two building shopping center in Miami, Florida, which consists of (i) one stand-alone building which is leased to ten unaffiliated third parties and houses our recently opened (October 2019) package liquor store (approximately 3,250 square feet) and (ii) a second stand-alone building where our limited partnership owned restaurant located at 12790 SW 88th Street, Miami, Florida, (Store #70), operates. .\n(7) During the second quarter of our fiscal year 2014, we closed on the purchase of the building in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which is leased to our franchisee owned restaurant located at 1479 E. Commercial Boulevard, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, (Store #15).\n(8) During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019, our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19), was damaged by a fire and was forced to close. While it was initially contemplated that Store #19 would be renovated, because of the damage caused by the fire, we determined that Store #19 should be demolished and rebuilt. As a result, the package liquor store and restaurant has been closed since our first quarter year 2019. Our loss was covered by insurance, including but not limited to business interruption coverage.\n(9) During the second quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into a lease for this location, which lease was subsequently assigned to a limited partnership. We plan to raise funds to renovate this new location for operation as a \u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d restaurant using our limited partnership ownership model. The option to purchase was retained by the Company when the lease was assigned to the limited partnership.\n(10) Subsequent to the end of our fiscal 2020, we purchased the 4,600 square foot stand-alone building located at 5450 N. State Road 7, North Lauderdale, Florida and which since April, 1971 has housed our Company-owned combination restaurant and package liquor store (Store #40).\nCasualty Loss\nDuring the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019, our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19) was damaged by a fire and was forced to close. Due to the damage caused by the fire, we determined that Store #19 should be demolished and rebuilt and as a result, the package liquor store and restaurant were closed for our fiscal years 2020 and 2019. We had insurance coverage of $1,975,000, in the aggregate, which our insurance carrier paid. We sustained a loss of $1,373,000 on our building and business personal property, against which we received insurance proceeds of $1,200,000 resulting in a loss of $173,000. We had a gain of $775,000 on our business interruption coverage, which when netted against our loss of $173,000 on our building and business personal property produced a gain of $602,000 during our fiscal year 2019.\nPurchase of Real Property; Option to Lease Agreement\nPompano Beach, Florida\nDuring the second quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we purchased from an unrelated third party the vacant real property (the \u201cProperty\u201d), located at 2119 S.E. 9th Street, Pompano Beach, Florida for $1,300,000 cash at closing. The Property is adjacent to property owned by a third party unaffiliated with us and leased to another third party unaffiliated with us for use as a restaurant (the \u201cAdjacent Property\u201d). At closing, we executed an Option to Lease Agreement to lease the Adjacent Property for a 50-year term commencing in November 2022. We will either (i) sublease the building on the Adjacent Property to a related party for operation as a \u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d restaurant as a franchise and use the Property as parking; or (ii) renovate the building on the Adjacent Property for operation as a \u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d restaurant and use the Property as parking. If we renovate this new restaurant location on the Adjacent Property, we plan to raise funds using our limited partnership ownership model.\nExecution of Leases for New Locations\nMiramar, Florida (\u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d)\nDuring fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into a Lease Agreement with a non-affiliated third party for the lease of a restaurant location in a shopping center in Miramar, Florida. The shopping center is currently in the developmental stage and the Lease Agreement is still contingent upon our receipt of delivery of the leased premises by August 28, 2021. We plan to assign the Lease Agreement to a limited partnership in which (i) we will be the sole general partner; and (ii) a wholly owned subsidiary will be the limited partner. While there can be no assurances that we will be successful in doing so, we intend to sell limited partnership interests to third parties as well as affiliates of the Company in order to raise net proceeds, in an amount to be determined, which proceeds will be used to renovate this potential restaurant location. We anticipate that the new restaurant location\u2019s ownership and operating structure will be substantially similar to that of our other restaurants owned by limited partnerships. Any amounts we advance to the limited partnership will be applied as a credit to limited partnership equity in the limited partnership we may acquire (which equity shall be purchased at the same price and upon the same terms as other equity investors). If we do not acquire equity in the limited partnership for at least $250,000, any excess amounts advanced by us will be reimbursed to us by the limited partnership without interest. Through October 3, 2020, we have no advances to the limited partnership.\nMiramar, Florida (\u201cBig Daddy\u2019s Liquors\u201d)\nDuring the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into a Lease Agreement with a non-affiliated third party for the lease of a package liquor store location in a shopping center in Miramar, Florida, directly adjacent to the new non-affiliated restaurant location described above. The shopping center is currently in the developmental stage and the Lease Agreement is still contingent upon our receipt of delivery of the leased premises by August 28, 2021. The new package liquor store location will be Company-owned.\nRe-Financing of Existing Mortgage\nDuring the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary, Flanigan\u2019s Calusa Center, LLC, re-financed its mortgage with our unrelated third party lender, increasing the principal amount from $2.72 million to $7.21 million. The principal balance and all accrued interest of our existing mortgage matured November 30, 2019. The re-financed mortgage earns interest at the fixed annual rate of 3.86%, is amortized over twenty (20) years, with equal monthly payments of principal and interest each in the amount of $43,000 and the entire principal balance and all accrued interest due in seven (7) years. The funds we received from the re-financing of this mortgage (approximately $4.5 million) will be used for working capital.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nMenu Price Increases\nEffective November 29, 2020 we increased menu prices for our bar offerings to target an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 1.83% annually and effective December 6, 2020 we increased menu prices for our food offerings to target an increase to our food revenues of approximately 2.45% annually to offset higher food costs and higher overall expenses. Prior to these increases, we previously raised menu prices in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2019.\nExercise of Options to Purchase\nNorth Lauderdale, Florida (\u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d/\u201dBig Daddy\u2019s Liquors\u201d)\nOn October 7, 2014, we entered into an Amendment to Lease Agreement (the \u201cLease Amendment\u201d) with a non-affiliated third party from whom we rent approximately 4,600 square feet of commercial space located at 5450 N. State Road 7, North Lauderdale, Florida where we operate a combination \u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d restaurant and \u201cBig Daddy\u2019s Liquors\u201d package liquor store (Store #40). The Lease Amendment extended the term of the Lease Agreement until December 31, 2020 and grants us the option to purchase, (the \u201cOption to Purchase\u201d), the real property and improvements on December 31, 2020 for $1,200,000. During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2020 we exercised the Option to Purchase and closed on the acquisition of the property on December 31, 2020. We paid all cash at closing.\nSunrise, Florida (\u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d)\nDuring the second quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into a Lease Agreement (the \u201cSunrise Lease Agreement\u201d) with a non-affiliated third party to rent approximately 6,900 square feet of commercial space located at 14301 W. Sunrise Boulevard, Sunrise, Florida where, subject to certain conditions, we anticipate opening a new restaurant location. The Sunrise Lease Agreement grants us an option to purchase, (the \u201cOption to Purchase\u201d) the real property and improvements by February 28, 2021. During the third quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we assigned the Sunrise Lease Agreement, excluding the Option to Purchase, to a newly formed limited partnership. Subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2020, we exercised the Option to Purchase and anticipate closing during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2021. We intend to pay all cash at closing.\nGeneral Liability Insurance; Excess Insurance\nFor the policy year beginning December 30, 2020, we bound general liability insurance with an unrelated third party insurance carrier which incorporates a deductible of $10,000 per occurrence for both us and the limited partnerships. Our insurance carrier is responsible for $1,000,000 coverage per occurrence above our deductible, up to a maximum aggregate of $2,000,000 per year. We were also able to bind excess liability insurance at a reasonable premium, whereby our excess insurance carrier is responsible for $10,000,000 coverage above our primary general liability insurance coverage. We are uninsured against liability claims in excess of $11,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We discuss such risks, uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under the captions \u201cRisk Factors\u201d. In addition, the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.\nOVERVIEW\nFinancial Information Concerning Industry Segments\nOur business is conducted principally in two segments: the restaurant segment and the package liquor store segment. Financial information broken into these two principal industry segments for the two fiscal years ended October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019 is set forth in the Consolidated Financial Statements which are attached hereto.\nGeneral\nAs of October 3, 2020, Flanigan\u2019s Enterprises, Inc., a Florida corporation, together with its subsidiaries (\u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d, \u201cours\u201d and \u201cus\u201d as the context requires), (i) operated 27 units, consisting of restaurants, package liquor stores and combination restaurants/package liquor stores that we either own or have operational control over and partial ownership in; and (ii) franchises an additional five units, consisting of two restaurants (one of which we operate) and three combination restaurants/package liquor stores.\nFranchised Units. In exchange for our providing management and related services to our franchisees and granting them the right to use our service marks \"Flanigan's Seafood Bar and Grill\" and \"Big Daddy's Liquors\", our franchisees (four of which are franchised to members of the family of our Chairman of the Board, officers and/or directors), are required to (i) pay to us a royalty equal to 1% of gross package liquor sales and 3% of gross restaurant sales; and (ii) make advertising expenditures equal to between 1.5% to 3% of all gross sales based upon our actual advertising costs allocated between stores, pro-rata, based upon gross sales.\nAffiliated Limited Partnership Owned Units. We manage and control the operations of the eight restaurants owned by limited partnerships, except the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant which is managed and controlled by a related franchisee. Accordingly, the results of operations of all limited partnership owned restaurants, except the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant are consolidated with our results of operations for accounting purposes. The results of operations of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant are accounted for by us utilizing the equity method.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nREVENUES (in thousands):\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019\nRevenues. Total revenue for our fiscal year 2020 decreased $3,225,000 or 2.78% to $112,977,000 from $116,202,000 for our fiscal year 2019. The decrease in total revenue was due primarily to the negative impact of COVID-19 on our operations. Due to COVID-19, from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020, we ceased all dining and bar services at all of our restaurants, limiting service to take-out and delivery only of food, and implemented reduced hours at our retail package liquor stores. From mid-May 2020 through the beginning of July 2020, there was a gradual elimination of restrictions on our restaurant operations, permitting us to, among other things, provide dining for outdoor seating patrons with appropriate social distancing and provide dining for indoor patrons at up to 50% capacity (depending on the location of the restaurant), but with no bar service and increased operating hours at our package liquor stores. From the beginning of July 2020 through the beginning of September 2020, we ceased dine-in service at all of our Miami-Dade County, Florida restaurants, (two Company-owned and six limited partnership owned restaurants). Since the beginning of September 2020, we have been offering both food and bar options at all of our restaurants, including those located in Miami-Dade County, Florida, with appropriate social distancing and dine-in service at up to 100% capacity, including outdoor dining. The negative effect of COVID-19 on our operations was partially offset by the fifty-third week in our fiscal year 2020, the 2019 Price Increases (defined below) and increased package liquor store sales. Effective June 16, 2019 we increased certain menu prices for our bar offerings to target an increase to our total bar revenues of approximately 6.2% annually and effective June 23, 2019 we increased certain menu prices for our food offerings to target an increase to our total food revenues of approximately 3.4% annually, (the \u201c2019 Price Increases\u201d). We expect that total revenue for our fiscal year 2021 will decrease due to our operations being adversely impacted by COVID-19. We expect that Store #19 will remain closed during our fiscal year 2021 and accordingly do not expect to generate any revenue from it.\nRestaurant Food Sales. Restaurant revenue generated from the sale of food, including non-alcoholic beverages, at restaurants (food sales) totaled $68,685,000 for our fiscal year 2020 as compared to $71,814,000 for our fiscal year 2019. The decrease in restaurant food sales for our fiscal year 2020 as compared to restaurant food sales during our fiscal year 2019 is attributable to the negative effects of COVID-19 on our operations, partially offset by the fifty-third week in our fiscal year 2020 and the 2019 Price Increases. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales (for restaurants, subject to closures for COVID-19, open for all of our fiscal years 2020 and 2019, which consists of nine restaurants owned by us, (excluding Store #19 which was closed for our fiscal years 2020 and 2019 due to a fire on October 2, 2018) and eight restaurants owned by affiliated limited partnerships) was $1,287,000 and $1,379,000 for our fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 6.67%. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales for Company-owned restaurants only was $649,000 and $696,000 for our fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 6.75%. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales for affiliated limited partnership owned restaurants only was $638,000 and $683,000 for our fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 6.59%. We expect that restaurant food sales, including non-alcoholic beverages, for our fiscal year 2021 will decrease due to the negative effects of COVID-19 on our operations.\nRestaurant Bar Sales. Restaurant revenue generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages at restaurants totaled $15,967,000 for our fiscal year 2020 as compared to $22,476,000 for our fiscal year 2019. The decrease in restaurant bar sales for our fiscal year 2020 as compared to restaurant bar sales during our fiscal year 2019 is attributable to the negative effects of COVID-19 on our operations, partially offset by the fifty third week in our fiscal year 2020 and the 2019 Price Increases. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales (for restaurants, open (except, however, when closed due to government directives in fiscal year 2020) for all of our fiscal years 2020 and 2019, which consists of nine restaurants owned by us, (excluding Store #19 which was closed for our fiscal years 2020 and 2019 due to a fire on October 2, 2018) and eight restaurants owned by affiliated limited partnerships) was $301,000 and $432,000 for our fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 30.32%. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales for Company-owned restaurants only was $135,000 and $197,000 for our fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 31.47%. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales for affiliated limited partnership owned restaurants only was $166,000 and $235,000 for our fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of 29.36%. We expect that restaurant bar sales, including non-alcoholic beverages, for our fiscal year 2021 will decrease due to the negative effects of COVID-19 on our operations.\nPackage Liquor Store Sales. Revenue generated from sales of liquor and related items at package liquor stores totaled $26,276,000 for our fiscal year 2020 as compared to $19,327,000 for our fiscal year 2019, an increase of $6,949,000 or 35.95%. This increase was primarily due to increased package liquor store traffic despite COVID-19 and because of the opening of our new retail package liquor store (Store #45) located in Kendall, Florida during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. The weekly average of same store package liquor store sales, which includes eight (8) Company-owned package liquor stores, (excluding Store #19, which was closed for our fiscal years 2020 and 2019 due to a fire on October 2, 2018 and also excluding Store #45, which opened for business on October 10, 2019), was $462,000 and $372,000 for our fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively, an increase of 24.19%. We anticipate that revenue generated from the sale of liquor and related items at package liquor stores for our fiscal year 2021 will increase when compared to our fiscal year 2020 due to what appears to be an increased demand for package liquor store products resulting from COVID-19.\nOperating Costs and Expenses. Operating costs and expenses, (consisting of cost of merchandise sold, payroll and related costs, occupancy costs and selling, general and administrative expenses), for our fiscal year 2020 increased $180,000 or 0.16% to $110,066,000 from $109,886,000 for our fiscal year 2019. The minimal increase was primarily due to cost cutting measures we have implemented since mid-March 2020 to reduce and/or control costs because of the negative effects of COVID-19 on our operations. We expect our operating costs and expenses will increase for our fiscal year 2021 as cost cutting measures are reversed. Operating costs and expenses increased as a percentage of total sales to approximately 97.42% in our fiscal year 2020 from 94.56% in our fiscal year 2019.\nGross Profit. Gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of merchandise sold from sales.\nRestaurant Food and Bar Sales. Gross profit for restaurant food and bar sales for our fiscal year 2020 decreased to $56,134,000 from $61,212,000 for our fiscal year 2019. Our gross profit margin for restaurant food and bar sales (calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of restaurant food and bar sales), was 66.31% for our fiscal year 2020 and 64.92% for our fiscal year 2019. Gross profit margin for restaurant food and bar sales increased during our fiscal year 2020 when compared to our fiscal year 2019 due to the inclusion of a 10% take-out charge on restaurant food sales, offset by the negative effects of COVID-19 on our restaurant bar operations and higher gross profit margin items as well as higher food costs. If we can maintain the same level of our take out charges on restaurant food sales, we expect that our gross profit margin for restaurant food and bar sales will increase during our fiscal year 2021 for the same reasons.\nPackage Liquor Store Sales. Gross profit for package liquor store sales for our fiscal year 2020 increased to $7,084,000 from $5,269,000 for our fiscal year 2019, due primarily to increased package liquor store traffic which we believe has been caused by COVID-19, as well as the opening of our new Store #45 during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. Our gross profit margin (calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of package liquor store sales) for package liquor store sales was 26.96% for our fiscal year 2020 and 27.26% for our fiscal year 2019. We anticipate that the gross profit margin for package liquor store merchandise will decrease during our fiscal year 2021 due to higher costs and a reduction in pricing of certain package store merchandise to be more competitive.\nPayroll and Related Costs. Payroll and related costs for our fiscal year 2020 decreased $474,000 or 1.32% to $35,399,000 from $35,873,000 for our fiscal year 2019. Lower payroll and related costs for our fiscal year 2020 were due to certain cost cutting measures including material layoffs at our restaurants and reduced corporate personnel salaries from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020 and thereafter due to an adjustment to our traditional staffing model to meet customer demand, increased by payroll for our package liquor store in Kendall, Florida, which opened for business during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020. We anticipate that until our restaurant operations are restored to pre-COVID-19 levels, of which there can be no assurance, payroll and related costs will be less than our costs from 2019. Payroll and related costs as a percentage of total sales was 31.33% in our fiscal year 2020 as compared to 30.87% of total sales in our fiscal year 2019.\nOccupancy Costs. Occupancy costs (consisting of percentage rent, common area maintenance, repairs, real property taxes, amortization of leasehold purchases and rent expense associated with operating lease liabilities under ASC 842) for our fiscal year 2020 increased $986,000 or 16.29% to $7,040,000 from $6,054,000 for our fiscal year 2019 primarily due to our adoption of ASC 842. We anticipate that our occupancy costs will remain stable throughout our fiscal year 2021.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses (consisting of general corporate expenses, including but not limited to advertising, insurance, professional costs, clerical and administrative overhead) for our fiscal year 2020 decreased $906,000 or 4.35% to $19,917,000 from $20,823,000 for our fiscal year 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total sales in our fiscal year 2020 to 17.63% as compared to 17.92% in our fiscal year 2019. We anticipate that until our operations are restored to pre-COVID-19 levels, of which there can be no assurance, our selling, general and administrative expenses will be less than our expenses for our fiscal year 2020, offset by increases in expenses across all categories.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for our fiscal year 2020, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, increased $200,000 or 6.58% to $3,240,000 from $3,040,000 for our fiscal year 2019. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was 2.87% of revenue for our fiscal year 2020 and 2.62% of revenue for our fiscal year 2019.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, for our fiscal year 2020 increased $128,000 to $836,000 from $708,000 for our fiscal year 2019. Interest expense, net, increased for our fiscal year 2020 due to our borrowing of an additional $4.5 million during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020 on the re-financing by our wholly owned subsidiary, Flanigan\u2019s Calusa Center, LLC, of its mortgage loan with an unrelated third party lender, increasing the principal amount borrowed from $2.72 million to $7.21 million and our borrowing of an additional approximately $10.0 million during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020 on our PPP Loans. Interest expense, net, will increase for our fiscal year 2021 due to our borrowing of an additional $10.0 million during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020 on our PPP Loans, if not forgiven.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense for our fiscal year 2020 was a benefit of $60,000, as compared to an expense of $887,000 for our fiscal year 2019.\nNet Income. Net income for our fiscal year 2020 decreased $3,193,000 or 59.38% to $2,184,000 from $5,377,000 for our fiscal year 2019. Net income for our fiscal year 2020 decreased when compared to net income for our fiscal year 2019 due to the negative effects of COVID-19 on our operations, our adoption of ASC 842, higher food costs and overall expenses, offset by our implementation of the cost cutting measures and the 2019 Price Increases. As a percentage of sales, net income in our fiscal year 2020 is 1.93%, as compared to 4.63% in our fiscal year 2019.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Stockholders. Net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year 2020 decreased $2,538,000 or 69.57% to $1,110,000 from $3,648,000 for our fiscal year 2019. Net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year 2020 decreased when compared to our fiscal year 2019 primarily due to the negative effects of COVID-19 on our operations, our adoption of ASC 842, higher food costs and overall expenses, offset by our implementation of the cost cutting measures, increased revenue at our package retail stores and the 2019 Price Increases. As a percentage of sales, net income for our fiscal year 2020 is 0.98%, as compared to 3.14% for our fiscal year 2019.\nNew Limited Partnership Restaurants\nAs new restaurants open, our income from operations will be adversely affected due to our obligation to advance pre-opening costs, including but not limited to pre-opening rent for the new locations. During our fiscal year 2020, we had one new restaurant location in Sunrise, Florida in the development stage. During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered leases for two spaces adjacent to each other, to house a new \u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d as well as a \u201cBig Daddy\u2019s Wine and Liquors\u201d in a shopping center in Miramar, Florida, which shopping center is currently under construction.\nMenu Price Increases and Trends\nEffective June 16, 2019 we increased menu prices for our bar offerings to target an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 6.2% annually and effective June 23, 2019 we increased menu prices for our food offerings to target an increase to our food revenues of approximately 3.4% annually to offset higher food costs and higher overall expenses. Prior to these increases, we previously raised menu prices in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2017.\nSubsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2020, we increased menu prices for our bar offerings (effective November 29, 2020) to target an increase of our bar revenues of approximately 1.83% annually and we increased menu prices for our food offerings (effective December 6, 2020) to target an increase to our food revenues of approximately 2.45% annually to offset higher food costs and higher overall expenses.\nCOVID-19 has and will continue to materially and adversely affect our restaurant business for what may be a prolonged period of time. This damage and disruption has resulted from events and factors that were impossible for us to predict and are beyond our control. As a result, and despite experiencing increased sales and traffic at certain of our package liquor stores, COVID-19 has materially adversely affected our results of operations for our fiscal year 2020 and will, in all likelihood, impact our results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition for our fiscal year 2021. The extent to which our restaurant business may be adversely impacted and its effect on our operations, liquidity and/or financial condition cannot be accurately predicted.\nWe are not actively searching for locations for the operation of new package liquor stores, but when our attempt to expand \u201cThe Whale\u2019s Rib\u201d restaurant concept in Miami, Florida was abandoned, we decided that the space we had targeted for the \u201cThe Whales Rib\u201d would be ideal for the operation of a package liquor store and during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2018, we received governmental approval to operate a package liquor store at that location. The new package liquor store (Store #45) located in Kendall, Florida opened for business in October 2019. During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered a lease to house a new \u201cBig Daddy\u2019s Wine & Liquors\u201d package liquor store in space adjacent to where we are planning a new \u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d, restaurant in a shopping center in Miramar, Florida, which shopping center is currently under construction.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe fund our operations through cash from operations. As of October 3, 2020, we had cash of approximately $29,922,000, an increase of $16,250,000 from our cash balance of $13,672,000 as of September 28, 2019. During the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020, we, certain of the entities owning the limited partnership stores (the \u201cLP\u2019s\u201d), franchised stores (the \u201cFranchisees\u201d) as well as the store we manage but do not own (the \u201cManaged Store\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cBorrowers\u201d), applied for and received loans from an unrelated third party lender (the \u201cLender\u201d) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP\u201d) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) enacted March 27, 2020, in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $13.1 million (the \u201cPPP Loans\u201d), of which approximately: (i) $5.9 million was loaned to us; (ii) $4.1 million was loaned to 8 of the LP\u2019s; (iii) $2.6 million was loaned to 5 of the Franchisees; and (iv) $0.5 million was loaned to the Managed Store. During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020, our wholly owned subsidiary, Flanigan\u2019s Calusa Center, LLC, re-financed its mortgage loan with an unrelated third party lender, increasing the principal amount borrowed from $2.72 million to $7.21 million.\nThe PPP Loans, which are in the form of Notes issued by each of the Borrowers, mature two years from the date of funding (dates ranging from May 5, 2022 to May 11, 2022) and bear interest at a rate of 1.00% per annum, payable monthly commencing approximately six months from the date of issuance of the Notes (issuance dates ranging from April 30, 2020 to May 6, 2020). The Notes may be prepaid by the applicable Borrower at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. Proceeds from the PPP Loans are available to the respective Borrower to fund designated expenses, including certain payroll costs, group health care benefits and other permitted expenses, including rent and interest on mortgages and other debt obligations incurred before February 15, 2020. Under the terms of the PPP, up to the entire amount of principal and accrued interest may be forgiven to the extent the proceeds of the PPP Loans are used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act and applicable implementing guidance issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the PPP. No assurance can be given that the Borrowers will obtain forgiveness of the PPP Loan in whole or in part.\nWith respect to any portion of any of the PPP Loans that is not forgiven under the terms of the PPP, such amounts will be subject to customary provisions for a loan of this type, including customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of the provisions of the applicable PPP Note and cross-defaults on any other loan with the Lender or other creditors.\nNotwithstanding the negative effects of COVID-19 on our operations, we believe that our current cash availability from our cash on hand, positive cash flow from operations and borrowed funds will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.\nAny future determination to pay cash dividends will be at our Board\u2019s discretion and will depend upon our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements and such other factors as our Board deems relevant. There can be no assurances that any future dividends will be paid.\nCASH FLOWS\nCapital Expenditures\nIn addition to using cash for our operating expenses, we use cash to fund the development and construction of new restaurants and to fund capitalized property improvements for our existing restaurants. During our fiscal year 2020, we acquired property and equipment of $2,766,000, (of which $379,000 was for construction in progress; $118,000 was deposits recorded in other assets; and $10,000 was deposits transferred to construction in progress as of September 28, 2019), which amount included $278,000 for renovations to two (2) existing limited partnership restaurant and $466,000 for renovations to five (5) Company-owned restaurants. During our fiscal year 2019, we acquired property and equipment of $6,323,000, (of which $1,300,000 was for the purchase of vacant real property in Pompano Beach, Florida; $1,058,000 was for construction in progress; $595,000 was deposits recorded in other assets; and $386,000 was deposits transferred to construction in progress as of September 29, 2018), which amount included $120,000 for renovations to one (1) existing limited partnership restaurant and $559,000 for renovations to three (3) Company-owned restaurants. We anticipate the cost of this refurbishment in our fiscal year 2021 will be approximately $950,000, excluding construction/renovations to Store #19 (our combination package liquor store and restaurant which is being rebuilt due to damages caused by a fire) and Store #85 (our Sunrise, Florida restaurant location in development), which funds will be provided from operations.\nDebt\nAs of October 3, 2020, we had long term debt of $26,323,000, as compared to $13,080,000 as of September 28, 2019. Our long term debt increased as of October 3, 2020 as compared to September 28, 2019 due to (i) the PPP Loan to us of $5.9 million; (ii) the PPP Loans to our eight limited partnerships of $4.1 million; (iii) the re-financing of its mortgage loan by our wholly owned subsidiary, Flanigan\u2019s Calusa Center, LLC, increasing the principal amount borrowed from $2.72 million to $7.21 million; and (iv) $1,317,000 for financed insurance premiums, less any payments made on account thereof.\nPrior to obtaining the PPP Loans, we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our loans with our unrelated third party institutional lender (the \u201cInstitutional Lender\u201d) under which as of October 3, 2020, we owe in the aggregate approximately $12,209,000 (the \u201cInstitutional Loans\u201d). We determined that as of the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020, we were not in compliance with our financial covenants contained in the Institutional Loans related to the Rent Adjusted Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio because our consolidated debt during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020 increased due to our repayment obligations under the PPP Loans (the \u201cCovenant Breach\u2019). Pursuant to the terms of the Institutional Loans, the Covenant Breach, grants the Institutional Lender the right to exercise certain remedies under the Institutional Loans, including the right to accelerate the indebtedness owed by us to the Institutional Lender thereunder. On August 10, 2020, we received a written waiver of the Covenant Breach from the Institutional Lender, which, among other things, waives the Covenant Breach through June 30, 2021. As of October 3, 2020, we are in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our loans with our Institutional Lender.\nThere can be no assurances that we will be in compliance with our financial covenants thereafter due to, among other things, that our results of operations will likely continue to be materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Absent a waiver, failure to be in compliance with our financial covenants would constitute a default under the Institutional Loans with our Institutional Lender when reported. Such a default, if not cured or waived, would allow the Institutional Lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness we owe under the Institutional Loans, making it due and payable at the time. If maturity of the Institutional Loans were accelerated, it would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.\nWe repaid long term debt, including auto loans, financed insurance premiums and mortgages in the amount of $2,540,000 and $2,820,000 in our fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(a) Mortgage on Real Property\nOn November 27, 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary, Flanigan\u2019s Calusa Center, LLC, re-financed its mortgage loan with an unrelated third party lender, increasing the principal amount borrowed from $2.72 million to $7.21 million. The principal balance and all accrued interest of the mortgage loan that had been outstanding matured November 30, 2019. The re-financed mortgage loan earns interest at the fixed annual rate of 3.86%, is amortized over twenty (20) years, requires us to pay monthly payments of principal and interest in the amount of $43,373 with the entire principal balance and all accrued interest due in November 2026. We intend to use the excess funds we received from the re-financing of this mortgage loan (approximately $4.4 million) for working capital.\n(b) Financed Insurance Premiums\nDuring our fiscal year 2020, we bound and financed through an unrelated third party lender the premiums on the following property, general liability, excess liability and terrorism insurance policies:\n(i) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2019, our general liability insurance, excluding limited partnerships, is a one (1) year policy, including automobile and excess liability coverage. The annual premium for this insurance coverage is $418,000;\n(ii) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2019, our general liability insurance for our limited partnerships is a one (1) year policy, including excess liability coverage. The annual premium for this insurance coverage is $459,000;\n(iii) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2019, our property insurance is a one (1) year policy and the annual premium for this insurance coverage is $561,000;\n(iv) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2019, our excess liability insurance is a one (1) year policy and the annual premium for this insurance coverage is $360,000; and\n(v) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2019, our terrorism insurance is a one (1) year policy and the annual premium for this insurance coverage is $12,000.\nOf the $1,810,000 annual premium amounts, which includes coverage for our franchises which are not included in our consolidated financial statements, we financed $1,656,000 through an unaffiliated third party lender. The finance agreement obligates us to repay the amounts financed together with interest at the rate of 2.55% per annum, over 11 months, with monthly payments of principal and interest, each in the amount of $158,000. The finance agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in all insurance policies, all unearned premium, return premiums, dividend payments and loss payments thereof.\nAs of October 3, 2020, the aggregate principal balance owed to the third party lender from the financing of our insurance policies is $365,000, excluding amounts which are reimbursed by our franchises for insurances covering their operations, but including the annual premiums for boiler insurance ($2,000) and directors and officers liability insurance ($34,000), which were added to the finance agreement during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020 and are financed over the balance of the term of the same.\n(c) Paycheck Protection Loans\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020, we, certain of the entities owning the limited partnership stores (the \u201cLP\u2019s\u201d), franchised stores (the \u201cFranchisees\u201d), as well as the store we manage but do not own (the \u201cManaged Store\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cBorrowers\u201d), applied for and received loans from an unrelated third party lender pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP\u201d) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) enacted March 27, 2020, in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $13.1 million, (the \u201cPPP Loans\u201d), of which approximately: (i) $5.9 million was loaned to us ; (ii) $4.1 million was loaned to 8 of the LP\u2019s ; (iii) $2.6 million was loaned to 5 of the Franchisees; and (iv) $0.5 million was loaned to the Managed Store. The PPP Loans to the Franchisees and the Managed Store are not included in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe PPP Loans, which are in the form of Notes issued by each of the Borrowers, mature two years from the date of funding (dates ranging from May 5, 2022 to May 11, 2022) and bear interest at a rate of 1.00% per annum, payable monthly commencing approximately six months from the date of issuance of the Notes (issuance dates ranging from April 30, 2020 to May 6, 2020). The Notes may be prepaid by the applicable Borrower at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. Proceeds from the PPP Loans are available to the respective Borrower to fund designated expenses, including certain payroll costs, group health care benefits and other permitted expenses, including rent and interest on mortgages and other debt obligations incurred before February 15, 2020. Under the terms of the PPP, up to the entire amount of principal and accrued interest may be forgiven to the extent the proceeds of the PPP Loans are used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act and applicable implementing guidance issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the PPP. No assurance can be given that the Borrowers will obtain forgiveness of the PPP Loans in whole or in part.\nWith respect to any portion of any of the PPP Loans that is not forgiven under the terms of the PPP, such amounts will be subject to customary provisions for a loan of this type, including customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of the provisions of the applicable PPP Note and cross-defaults on any other loan with the Lender or other creditors.\nLeases\nTo conduct certain of our operations, we lease restaurant and package liquor store space in South Florida from unrelated third parties. Our leases have remaining lease terms of up to 10 years, some of which include options to renew and extend the lease terms for up to an additional 30 years. We presently intend to renew some of the extension options available to us and for purposes of computing the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities required by ASC 842, we have incorporated into all lease terms which may be extended, an additional term of the lesser of (i) the amount of years the lease may be extended; or (ii) 15 years.\nFollowing adoption of ASC 842, common area maintenance and property taxes are not considered to be lease components.\nThe components of lease expense are as follows:\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases as follows:\nThe following table outlines the minimum future lease payments for the next five years and thereafter:\nTotal rent expense for all of our operating leases was approximately $3,963,000 in our fiscal year 2019 and is included in \u201cOccupancy Costs\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of income. The total rent expense is comprised of the following:\nConstruction Contracts\n(a) 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19)\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated architect for design and development services totaling $77,000 for the re-build of our restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19) which has been closed since October 2018 due to damages caused by a fire, of which $62,000 has been paid. Additionally, during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated general contractor for site work at this location totaling $1,618,000, (i) to connect the real property where this restaurant operated (Store #19) to city sewer and (ii) to construct a new building on the adjacent parcel of real property for the operation of a package liquor store. During our fiscal year 2020, we agreed to change orders to the agreement for additional construction services increasing the total contract price by $112,000 to $1,730,000, of which $-0- has been paid through October 3, 2020. Subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2020, we agreed to additional change orders to the agreement for additional construction services increasing the total contract price by $28,000 to $1,757,000 of which $64,000 has been paid.\n(b) 14301 W. Sunrise Boulevard, Sunrise, Florida (Store #85)\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we also entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated design group for design and development services of our new location at 14301 W. Sunrise Boulevard, Sunrise, Florida 33323 (Store #85) for a total contract price of $122,000. During our fiscal year 2020, we agreed upon amendments to the $122,000 Contract for additional design and development services which had the effect of increasing the total contract price by $18,000 to $140,000, of which $106,000 has been paid through October 3, 2020. Additionally during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2020, we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated general contractor for interior renovations at this location totaling $1,236,000, of which $-0- has been paid through October 3, 2020. Subsequent to October 3, 2020, $111,000 has been paid.\nPurchase Commitments/Supply\nIn order to fix the cost and ensure adequate supply of baby back ribs for our restaurants, on November 9, 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement with our current rib supplier, whereby we agreed to purchase approximately $6,420,000 of baby back ribs during calendar year 2021 from this vendor at a fixed cost.\nWhile we anticipate purchasing all of our rib supply from this vendor, we believe there are several other alternative vendors available, if needed.\nFlanigan\u2019s Fish Company, LLC\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020, we temporarily suspended the operation of our Flanigan\u2019s Fish Company, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (\u201cFFC\u201d) due to the decrease in demand for imported fresh fish caused by restrictions placed upon the operation of our restaurants due to COVID-19, relying instead on outside fresh fish purveyors. The suspension of operations lasted approximately 5 \u00bd weeks, after which we resumed operations. As of October 3, 2020, FFC supplies certain of the fish to all of our restaurants. Since we hold the controlling interest of FFC, the balance sheet and operating results of this entity are consolidated into the accompanying financial statements of the Company. Sales and purchases of fish are recognized in restaurant food sales and restaurant and lounges (cost of merchandise sold), respectively, in the consolidated statements of income at the time of sale to the restaurant. In addition, the 49% of FFC owned by the unrelated third party is recognized as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements.\nPurchase of Limited Partnership Interests\nDuring our fiscal year 2020, we did not purchase any limited partnership interests. During our fiscal year 2019, we purchased from one limited partner (who is not an officer, director or family member of officers or directors) a limited partnership interest of 0.63% in a limited partnership which owns a restaurant, for a purchase price of $4,800.\nWorking Capital\nThe table below summarizes our current assets, current liabilities and working capital as of the end of our fiscal years 2020 and 2019:\nOur working capital as of our fiscal year ended October 3, 2020 increased $4,682,000 or 72.43% to $11,146,000 from $6,464,000 as of September 28, 2019 due to the cash received from (i) the PPP Loan to us of $5.9 million; (ii) the PPP Loans to our eight limited partnerships of $4.1 million; and (iii) the re-financing of its mortgage loan by our wholly owned subsidiary, Flanigan\u2019s Calusa Center, LLC, increasing the principal amount borrowed from $2.72 million to $7.21 million, offset by $1,281,000 due to our adoption of ASC 842. During our fiscal year 2019, we used working capital of approximately $1,300,000 to close on our purchase of the vacant parcel of property located at 2119 S.E. 9th Street, Pompano Beach, Florida.\nWhile there can be no assurance due to, among other things, unanticipated expenses or unanticipated decline in revenues, or both, we believe that our cash on hand, cash flow from operations and funds available from our borrowings will adequately fund operations, debt reductions and planned capital expenditures throughout our fiscal year 2021.\nDuring our fiscal year 2021, we plan to use certain funds on-hand, borrowed funds and/or insurance proceeds (i) to construct a new building on a parcel of real property which we own which is adjacent to the real property where our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19) operated into which we plan to re-locate our package liquor store and to re-build the restaurant; (ii) to exercise the option to purchase the real property and improvements located at 5450 N. State Road 7, North Lauderdale, Florida from which we operate our combination \u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d restaurant and \u201cBig Daddy\u2019s Liquors\u201d package liquor store (Store #40); (iii) to exercise the option to purchase the real property and improvements located at 14301 W. Sunrise Boulevard, Sunrise, Florida which we are currently developing for a limited partnership for operation as a \u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d restaurant (Store #85); (iv) advance the cost of renovations to develop the \u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d restaurant which we are currently developing (Store #85). There can be no assurances as to the timing for us to construct the new building for the package liquor store and re-build the restaurant for Store #19 or to complete the renovations for the restaurant for Store #85.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRecently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nAdopted\nEffective September 29, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d). The new guidance requires that lease arrangements be presented on the lessee\u2019s balance sheet by recording a right-of-use asset and a lease liability equal to the present value of the related future minimum lease payments. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, using the retrospective approach. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a right-of-use asset of $27.8 million and a lease liability of $27.8 million. At October 1, 2020, the Company decreased the operating lease right-of-use asset by $2.6 million and the operating lease liability by $2.6 million with the reclassification of an operating lease to a finance lease due to the exercise of a purchase option subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2020. The Company recorded a finance lease right-of-use asset of $4.8 million and a finance lease liability of $4.8 million.\nWe elected the transition package of practical expedients, under which the Company does not have to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are leases, or contain leases, (2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases. In addition, we made an accounting policy election to exclude leases with an initial term of 12 months or less from the balance sheet. This standard had a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income due to the escalations of rent in the extensions but did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. See Note 13 for further disclosures resulting from the adoption of this new standard.\nIssued\nThere are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that we believe will have a material effect on our financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nEstimated Useful Lives of Property and Equipment\nThe estimates of useful lives for property and equipment are significant estimates. Expenditures for the leasehold improvements and equipment when a restaurant is first constructed are material. In addition, periodic refurbishing takes place and those expenditures can be material. We estimate the useful life of those assets by considering, among other things, expected use, life of the lease on the building, and warranty period, if applicable. The assets are then depreciated using a straight line method over those estimated lives. These estimated lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary. Any necessary adjustment to depreciation expense is made in the income statement of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary.\nConsolidation of Limited Partnerships\nAs of October 3, 2020, we operate eight (8) restaurants as general partner of the limited partnerships that own the operations of these restaurants. We expect that any expansion which takes place in opening new restaurants will also result in us operating the restaurants as general partner. In addition to the general partnership interest we also purchased limited partnership units ranging from 5% to 49% of the total units outstanding. As a result of these controlling interests, we consolidate the operations of these limited partnerships with ours despite the fact that we do not own in excess of 50% of the equity interests. All intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The non-controlling interests in the earnings of these limited partnerships are removed from net income and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for our income taxes using FASB ASC Topic 740, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d, which requires among other things, recognition of future tax benefits measured at enacted rates attributable to deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and to tax net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits to the extent that realization of said tax benefits is more likely than not. For discussion regarding our carryforwards refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year 2020.\nOther Matters\nImpact of Inflation\nThe primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food, beverage and labor costs. A large number of restaurant personnel are paid at rates based upon applicable minimum wage and increases in minimum wage directly affect labor costs. To date, inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results, but this circumstance may change in the future if food and fuel costs continue to rise.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on evaluations as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of our management team, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)) were effective to ensure that information the Company is required to disclose in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms.\nManagement\u2019s Assessment on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. This evaluation was based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013 (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of October 3, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls and Permitted Omission from Management\u2019s Assessment\nOur internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management\u2019s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management\u2019s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

(the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019, and the results of its operations and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended October 3, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standard\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as amended, effective September 29, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Marcum llp\nMarcum llp\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1999.\nFort Lauderdale, FL\nJanuary 15, 2021\nFLANIGAN\u2019S ENTERPRISES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED OCTOBER 3, 2020 AND SEPTEMBER 28,\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOrganization and Capitalization\nThe Company was incorporated in 1959 and operates in South Florida as a chain of full-service restaurants and package liquor stores. Restaurant food and beverage sales make up the majority of our total revenue. As of October 3, 2020, we (i) operated 27 units consisting of restaurants, package liquor stores and combination restaurants/package liquor stores that we either own or have operational control over and partial ownership in; and (ii) franchise an additional five units, consisting of two restaurants, (one of which we operate) and three combination restaurants/package liquor stores. With the exception of one restaurant we operate under the name \u201cThe Whale\u2019s Rib\u201d, and in which we do not have an ownership interest, all of the restaurants operate under our service mark \u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d and all of the package liquor stores operate under our service mark \u201cBig Daddy\u2019s Liquors\u201d.\nThe Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorize us to issue and have outstanding at any one time 5,000,000 shares of common stock at a par value of $0.10 per share.\nWe operate under a 52-53 week year ending the Saturday closest to September 30. Our fiscal year 2020 is comprised of a 53-week period and our fiscal year 2019 is comprised of a 52-week period.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned, and the accounts of the eight limited partnerships in which we act as general partner and have controlling interests. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nNoncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries are included in the consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of equity. We report consolidated net income inclusive of both the Company\u2019s and the noncontrolling interests\u2019 share, as well as amounts of consolidated net income (loss) attributable to each of the Company and the noncontrolling interests.\nUse of Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nUse of Estimates (Continued)\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenue and expenses during the period reported. These estimates include assessing the estimated useful lives of tangible assets, the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and estimates relating to the calculation of incremental borrowing rates and length of leases associated with right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in our consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nInventories\nOur inventories, which consist primarily of package liquor products, are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.\nLiquor Licenses\nIn accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d, our liquor licenses are indefinite lived assets, which are not being amortized, but are tested annually for impairment (see Note 10).\nProperty and Equipment\nOur property and equipment are stated at cost. We capitalize expenditures for major improvements and depreciation commences when the assets are placed in service. We record depreciation on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. We charge maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the life of the respective assets, to expense as incurred. When we dispose of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in income.\nOur estimated useful lives range from three to five years for vehicles and three to seven years for furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are currently being amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease or the life of the asset up to a maximum of 20 years. Our building and building improvements of our corporate offices in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; our building and building improvements of our construction office/warehouse in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; our combination restaurant and package liquor store in Hallandale, Florida; our restaurants in N. Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Florida; our package store in N. Miami, Florida, our shopping center in Miami, Florida and property in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, all of which we own, are being depreciated over forty years.\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nLeasehold Interests\nOur purchase of an existing restaurant location usually includes a lease to the business premises. As a result, a portion of the purchase price is allocated to the leasehold interest. We capitalize the cost of the leasehold interest and amortization commences upon our assumption of the lease. We amortize leasehold interests on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the lease.\nInvestment in Limited Partnerships\nWe use the consolidation method of accounting when we have a controlling interest in other companies and limited partnerships. We use the equity method of accounting when we have significant influence and an interest between twenty to fifty percent in other companies and limited partnerships, but do not exercise control. Under the equity method, our original investments are recorded at cost and are adjusted for our share of undistributed earnings or losses. All significant intercompany profits are eliminated.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are cash and cash equivalents.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe maintain deposit balances with financial institutions which balances may, from time to time, exceed the federally insured limits, which are $250,000 for interest and non-interest bearing accounts. We have not experienced any losses in such accounts.\nMajor Suppliers\nThroughout our fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we purchased substantially all of our food products from one major supplier pursuant to a master distribution agreement which entitled us to receive certain purchase discounts, rebates and advertising allowances that are recorded as a reduction of cost of merchandise sold in periods in which they are earned. We believe that several other alternative vendors are available, if necessary.\nThroughout our fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we purchased the majority of our alcoholic beverages from three local distributors. Each distributor has exclusive rights from the manufacturers to sell specific brands in given areas, so unless the exclusive distribution rights are transferred to another vendor, there are no alternate distributors available.\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue related to food, bar and package sale are recorded at the point of sale. Royalty-related revenues, which are 1% of package sales and 3% of restaurant sales, are recorded as income on a weekly basis, in arrears. We report our sales net of sales tax.\nPre-opening Costs\nAs new restaurants open, our income from operations will be adversely affected due to our obligation to fund pre-opening costs are those typically associated with the opening of a new restaurant and generally include payroll costs associated with the new restaurant opening, rent and promotional costs. We expense pre-opening costs as incurred.\nAdvertising Costs\nOur advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs incurred during our fiscal years ended October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019 were approximately ($113,000) and $97,000 respectively. Advertising costs incurred during our fiscal year ended October 3, 2020 were a credit as a result of lower advertising costs during the fiscal year due to COVID-19 and advertising allowances.\nGeneral Liability Insurance\nWe have general liability insurance which incorporates a deductible of $10,000 per occurrence for both us and the limited partnerships. Our insurance carrier is responsible for $1,000,000 coverage per occurrence above our deductible, up to a maximum aggregate of $2,000,000 per year. During our fiscal year ended October 3, 2020, we were able to purchase excess liability insurance, whereby our excess insurance carrier is responsible for $10,000,000 coverage above our primary general liability insurance coverage. We are un-insured against liability claims in excess of $11,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate.\nOur general policy is to settle only those legitimate and reasonable claims asserted and to aggressively defend and go to trial, if necessary, on frivolous and unreasonable claims. Under our current liability insurance policy, any expense incurred by us in defending a claim, including attorney's fees, are a part of our $10,000 deductible.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe respective carrying value of certain of our on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair value. These instruments include cash and cash equivalents, other\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nFair Value of Financial Instruments (Continued)\nreceivables, accounts payables, accrued expenses and debt. We have assumed carrying values to approximate fair values for those financial instruments, which are short-term in nature or are receivable or payable on demand. We estimated the fair value of debt based on current rates offered to us for debt of comparable maturities and similar collateral requirements.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820-10-50-1, we utilized a valuation model to determine the fair value of our swap agreements. As the valuation models for the swap agreements were based upon observable inputs, they are classified as Level 2 (see Note 14).\nDerivative Instruments\nWe account for derivative instruments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815-10-05-4, \u201cAccounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\u201d as amended, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and hedging activities. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815-10-05-4, derivative instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value. We recognize all changes in fair value through earnings unless the derivative is determined to be an effective hedge. We currently have two derivatives which we have designated as effective hedges (See Note 14).\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for our income taxes using FASB ASC Topic 740, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d, which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.\nWe follow the provisions regarding Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which require the recognition of a financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. We applied these changes to tax positions for our fiscal years ending October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019. We had no material unrecognized tax benefits and no adjustments to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows were required. Generally, federal, state and local authorities may examine the Company\u2019s tax returns for three years from the date of filing and the current and prior three years remain subject to examination as of October 3, 2020. We do not expect that unrecognized tax benefits will increase within the next twelve months. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense.\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated life of our intangible and other long-lived assets or whether the remaining balance of our intangible and other long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. If and when such factors, events or circumstances indicate that intangible or other long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we will determine the fair value of the asset by making an estimate of expected future cash flows over the remaining lives of the respective assets and compare that fair value with the carrying value of the assets in measuring their recoverability. In determining the expected future cash flows, the assets will be grouped at the lowest level for which there are cash flows, at the individual store level.\nEarnings Per Share\nWe follow FASB ASC Topic 260 - \u201cEarnings per Share.\u201d This section provides for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution. Earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares.\nRecently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nEffective September 29, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d). The new guidance requires that lease arrangements be presented on the lessee\u2019s balance sheet by recording a right-of-use asset and a lease liability equal to the present value of the related future minimum lease payments. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, using the modified retrospective approach. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a right-of-use asset of $27.8 million and a lease liability of $27.8 million. At October 1, 2020 the Company decreased the operating lease right-of-use asset by $2.6 million and the operating lease right-of-use liability by $2.6 million with the reclassification of an operating lease to a finance lease due to the exercise of a purchase option subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2020. The Company recorded a finance lease right-of-use asset of $4.8 million and a finance lease liability of $4.8 million.\nWe elected the transition package of practical expedients, under which the Company does not have to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are leases, or contain leases, (2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases. In addition, we made an accounting policy election to exclude leases with an initial term of 12 months or less from the balance sheet. This standard had a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income due to the escalations of rent in the extensions but did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nIssued\nThere are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that we believe will have a material effect on our financial statements.\nNOTE 2. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the fiscal years ended October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019 was approximately $3,144,000 and $2,919,000, respectively.\nNOTE 3. LEASEHOLD INTERESTS\nFuture leasehold amortization as of October 3, 2020 is as follows:\nNOTE 4. INVESTMENTS IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS\nWe have invested with others (some of whom are affiliated with our officers and directors) in nine limited partnerships which own and operate nine South Florida based restaurants under our service mark \u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d. In addition to being a limited partner in these limited partnerships, we are the sole general partner of eight of these limited partnerships and manage and control the operations of the restaurants except for the restaurant located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida where we only hold a limited partnership interest.\nGenerally, the terms of the limited partnership agreements provide that until the investors\u2019 cash investment in a limited partnership (including any cash invested by us) is returned in full, the limited partnership distributes to the investors annually out of available cash from the operation of the restaurant, as a return of capital, up to 25% of the cash invested in the limited\nNOTE 4. INVESTMENTS IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS (Continued)\npartnership, with no management fee paid to us. Any available cash in excess of the 25% of the cash invested in the limited partnership distributed to the investors annually, is paid one-half (\u00bd) to us as a management fee and one-half (1/2) to the investors (including us) prorata based upon the investors\u2019 investment, as a return of capital. Once all of the investors (including us) have received, in full, amounts equal to their cash invested, an annual management fee becomes payable to us equal to one-half (\u00bd) of cash available to be distributed, with the other one half (\u00bd) of available cash distributed to the investors (including us) as a profit distribution, pro-rata based upon the investors\u2019 investment.\nAs of October 3, 2020, limited partnerships owning eight (8) restaurants, (Surfside, Florida, Kendall, Florida, West Miami, Florida, Pinecrest, Florida, Wellington, Florida, Miami, Florida, Pembroke Pines, Florida and Davie, Florida locations), have returned all cash invested and we receive an annual management fee equal to one-half (\u00bd) of the cash available for distribution by the limited partnership. In addition to our receipt of distributable amounts from the limited partnerships, we receive a fee equal to 3% of gross sales for use of our \u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d service mark, which use is authorized only while we act as general partner.

During the third quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we assigned the Sunrise Lease Agreement to a newly formed limited partnership in which we currently are (i) the sole general partner; and (ii) our wholly owned subsidiary is the sole limited partner. While there can be no assurances that we will be successful in doing so, we intend to sell limited partnership interests to third parties as well as affiliates of the Company in order to raise net proceeds, in the amount of $5,000,000, which proceeds will be used to renovate this potential restaurant location. We anticipate that the new restaurant location\u2019s ownership and operating structure will be substantially similar to that of our other restaurants owned by limited partnerships.\nFort Lauderdale, Florida\nA corporation, owned by a member of our Board of Directors, acts as sole general partner of a limited partnership which has owned and operated a restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, Florida under our \u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d service mark since April 1, 1997. We have a 25% limited partnership interest in this limited partnership. 31.9% of the remaining limited partnership interest is owned by persons who are either our officers, directors or their family members. We have a franchise arrangement with this limited partnership. For accounting purposes, we do not consolidate the operations of this limited partnership into our operations. This entity is reported using the equity method in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of condensed unaudited financial information pertaining to our limited partnership investment in Fort Lauderdale, Florida:\nNOTE 5. INVESTMENT IN REAL PROPERTY; OPTION TO LEASE AGREEMENT:\nPompano Beach, Florida\nDuring the second quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we purchased from an unrelated third party the vacant real property (the \u201cProperty\u201d), located at 2119 S.E. 9th Street, Pompano Beach, Florida for $1,300,000 cash at closing. The Property is adjacent to property owned by a third party unaffiliated with us and leased to another third party unaffiliated with us for use as a restaurant (the \u201cAdjacent Property\u201d). At closing, we executed an Option to Lease Agreement to lease the Adjacent Property for a 50 year term commencing in November, 2022. We will either (i) sublease the building on the Adjacent Property to a related franchisee for operation as a \u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d restaurant and use the Property as parking; or (ii) renovate the building on the Adjacent Property for operation as a \u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d restaurant and use the Property as parking. If we renovate this new restaurant location on the Adjacent Property, we plan to raise funds using our limited partnership ownership model.\nNOTE 6. EXECUTION OF LEASES FOR NEW LOCATIONS:\nMiramar, Florida (\u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d)\nDuring fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into a Lease Agreement for a non-affiliated restaurant location in a shopping center in Miramar, Florida. The shopping center is currently in the developmental stage and the Lease Agreement is still contingent upon our receipt of delivery of the leased premises by August 28, 2021. We plan to assign the Lease Agreement to a limited partnership in which (i) we will be the sole general partner; and (ii) a wholly owned subsidiary will be the limited partner. While there can be no assurances that we will be successful in doing so, we intend to sell limited partnership interests to third parties as well as affiliates of the Company in order to raise net proceeds, in an amount to be determined, which proceeds will be used to renovate this potential restaurant location. We anticipate that the new restaurant location\u2019s ownership and operating structure will be substantially similar to that of our other restaurants owned by limited partnerships. Any amounts we advance to the limited partnership will be applied as a credit to limited partnership equity in the limited partnership we may acquire (which equity shall be purchased at the same price and upon the same terms as other equity investors). If we do not acquire equity in the limited partnership for at least $250,000, any excess amounts advanced by us will be reimbursed to us by the limited partnership without interest. Through October 3, 2020, we have no advances to the limited partnership.\nMiramar, Florida (\u201cBig Daddy\u2019s Liquors\u201d)\nDuring the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into a Lease Agreement for a non-affiliated package liquor store location in a shopping center in Miramar, Florida, directly adjacent to the new non-affiliated restaurant location. The shopping center is currently in the developmental stage and the Lease Agreement is still contingent upon our receipt of delivery of the leased premises by August 28, 2021. The new package liquor store location will be Company owned.\nNOTE 7. MORTGAGE / FINANCED INSURANCE PREMIUMS:\n(a) Mortgage on Real Property\nOn November 27, 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary, Flanigan\u2019s Calusa Center, LLC, re-financed its mortgage loan with an unrelated third party lender, increasing the principal amount borrowed from $2.72 million to $7.21 million. The principal balance and all accrued interest of the mortgage loan that had been outstanding matured November 30, 2019. The re-financed mortgage loan earns interest at the fixed annual rate of 3.86%, is amortized over twenty (20) years, requires us to pay monthly payments of principal and interest in the amount of $43,373 with the entire principal balance and all accrued interest due in November 2026. We intend to use the excess funds we received from the re-financing of this mortgage loan (approximately $4.4 million) for working capital.\n(b) Financed Insurance Premiums\nDuring our fiscal year 2020, we bound and financed through an unrelated third party lender the premiums on the following property, general liability, excess liability and terrorism insurance policies:\n(i) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2019, our general liability insurance, excluding limited partnerships, is a one (1) year policy, including automobile and excess liability coverage. The annual premium for this insurance coverage is $418,000;\n(ii) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2019, our general liability insurance for our limited partnerships is a one (1) year policy, including excess liability coverage. The annual premium for this insurance coverage is $459,000;\n(iii) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2019, our property insurance is a one (1) year policy and the annual premium for this insurance coverage is $561,000;\n(iv) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2019, our excess liability insurance is a one (1) year policy and the annual premium for this insurance coverage is $360,000; and\n(v) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2019, our terrorism insurance is a one (1) year policy and the annual premium for this insurance coverage is $12,000.\nOf the $1,810,000 annual premium amounts, which includes coverage for our franchises which are not included in our consolidated financial statements, we financed $1,656,000 through an unaffiliated third party lender. The finance agreement obligates us to repay the amounts financed together with interest at the rate of 2.55% per annum, over 11 months, with monthly payments of principal and interest, each in the amount of $153,000 . The finance agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in all insurance policies, all unearned premium, return premiums, dividend payments and loss payments thereof.\nAs of October 3, 2020, the aggregate principal balance owed to the third party lender from the financing of our insurance policies is $365,000, excluding amounts which are reimbursed by our franchises for insurances covering their operations, but including the annual premiums for boiler insurance ($2,000) and directors and officers liability insurance ($34,000), which were added to the finance agreement during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020 and are financed over the balance of the term of the same.\n(c) Paycheck Protection Loans\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020, we, certain of the entities owning the limited partnership stores (the \u201cLP\u2019s\u201d), franchised stores (the \u201cFranchisees\u201d), as well as the store we manage but do not own (the \u201cManaged Store\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cBorrowers\u201d), applied for and received loans from an unrelated third party lender pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP\u201d) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) enacted March 27, 2020, in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $13.1 million, (the \u201cPPP Loans\u201d), of which approximately: (i) $5.9 million was loaned to us; (ii) $4.1 million was loaned to 8 of the LP\u2019s ; (iii) $2.6 million was loaned to 5 of the Franchisees; and (iv) $0.5 million was loaned to the Managed Store. The PPP Loans to the Franchisees and the Managed Store are not included in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe PPP Loans, which are in the form of Notes issued by each of the Borrowers, mature two years from the date of funding (dates ranging from May 5, 2022 to May 11, 2022) and bear interest at a rate of 1.00% per annum, payable monthly commencing approximately six months from the date of issuance of the Notes (issuance dates ranging from April 30, 2020 to May 6, 2020). The Notes may be prepaid by the applicable Borrower at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. Proceeds from the PPP Loans will be available to the respective Borrower to fund designated expenses, including certain payroll costs, group health care benefits and other permitted expenses, including rent and interest on mortgages and other debt obligations incurred before February 15, 2020. Under the terms of the PPP, up to the entire amount of principal and accrued interest may be forgiven to the extent the proceeds of the PPP Loans are used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act and applicable implementing guidance issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the PPP. No assurance can be given that the Borrowers will obtain forgiveness of the PPP Loans in whole or in part.\nWith respect to any portion of any of the PPP Loans that is not forgiven under the terms of the PPP, such amounts will be subject to customary provisions for a loan of this type, including customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of the provisions of the applicable PPP Note and cross-defaults on any other loan with the Lender or other creditors.\nNOTE 8. CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC:\nIn March 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was declared a global pandemic and a National Public Health Emergency. The novel coronavirus pandemic and related \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders and other governmental mandates relating thereto (collectively, \u201cCOVID-19\u201d) adversely affected and will, in all likelihood continue to adversely affect, our restaurant operations and financial results for the foreseeable future. Due to COVID-19, from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020, we ceased all dining and bar services at all of our restaurants, limiting service to take-out and delivery only of food, and implemented reduced hours at our retail package liquor stores. From mid-May 2020 through the beginning of July 2020, there was a gradual elimination of restrictions on our restaurant operations, permitting us to, among other things, provide dining for outdoor seating patrons with appropriate social distancing and provide dining for indoor patrons at up to 50% capacity (depending on the location of the restaurant), but with no bar service and increased operating hours at our package liquor stores. From the beginning of July 2020 through the beginning of September 2020, we ceased dine-in service at all of our Miami-Dade County, Florida restaurants, (two Company-owned and six limited partnership owned restaurants). Since the beginning of September 2020, we have been offering both food and bar options at all of our restaurants, including those located in Miami-Dade County, Florida, with appropriate social distancing and dine-in service at up to 100% capacity, including outdoor dining.\nDue to COVID-19, we implemented (i) certain cost cutting measures including material layoffs at our restaurants and reduced corporate personnel salaries; and (ii) a number of changes to our operations such as the establishment of an in-house delivery service and an adjustment to our traditional staffing model to meet customer demand. We have been in regular contact with our suppliers and while to date we have not experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain, we could see future disruptions should the impacts of COVID-19 extend for a considerable amount of time. To support our employees, we have implemented work from home support, increased sanitization of high touch, high traffic areas in our restaurants, retail package liquor stores and corporate offices, provided personal protective equipment for our employees and increased the frequency of personal hygiene practices. From March 29, 2020 through May 9, 2020, the salaries of all our non-executive corporate office personnel were reduced by 20%, the base salaries of our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer were each reduced by 50% and our Chief Executive Officer waived his base salary, representing salary savings of approximately $135,000 during this period. Our employee headcount as of fiscal year end 2020 was 1,804 persons reduced from 1,870 persons as of our fiscal year end 2019.\nIn addition and also due to COVID-19, we did not make any quarterly distributions to our limited partners for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. For each of the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020, we made quarterly distributions to our limited partners equal to one-half (\u00bd) of the amounts that would have been distributed for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year end 2020, the United States government passed a $2.0 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) designed primarily to help keep businesses running during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act included provisions for certain deductions and tax credits, filing deadline extensions, filing payment deadlines and making available certain grant money to assist businesses. This CARES ACT allowed us to take advantage of credits, deferments, and deductions, and PPP Loans (described below) during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020. As a result, during the third and fourth quarter of 2020, we reversed certain of our cost cutting measures, including (i) reinstating employees laid off at our restaurants in anticipation of resuming dine-in service, (ii) restoring corporate personnel and executive salaries and (iii) paying prior salary reductions.\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020, we, certain of the entities owning the limited partnership stores (the \u201cLP\u2019s\u201d), franchised stores (the \u201cFranchisees\u201d) as well as the store we manage but do not own (the \u201cManaged Store\u201d), (collectively, the \u201cBorrowers\u201d), applied for and received loans from an unrelated third party lender pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP\u201d) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) enacted March 27, 2020, in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $13.1 million, (the \u201cPPP Loans\u201d), of which approximately: (i) $5.9 million was loaned to us; (ii) $4.1 million was loaned to 8 of the LP\u2019s; (iii) $2.6 million was loaned to 5 of the Franchisees; and (iv) $0.5 million was loaned to the Managed Store. The PPP Loans to the Franchisees and the Managed Store are not included in our consolidated financial statements. Due to our receipt of the PPP Loans, we reversed certain cost cutting measures, including reinstating employees laid off at our restaurants in anticipation of resuming dine-in service and restoring corporate personnel salaries.\nThe PPP Loans, which are in the form of Notes issued by each of the Borrowers, mature two years from the date of funding (dates ranging from May 5, 2022 to May 11, 2022) and bear interest at a rate of 1.00% per annum, payable monthly commencing approximately six months from the date of issuance of the Notes (issuance dates ranging from April 30, 2020 to May 6, 2020). The Notes may be prepaid by the applicable Borrower at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. Proceeds from the PPP Loans have been used and are available to the respective Borrower to fund designated expenses, including certain payroll costs, group health care benefits and other permitted expenses, including rent and interest on mortgages and other debt obligations incurred before February 15, 2020. Under the terms of the PPP, up to the entire amount of principal and accrued interest may be forgiven to the extent the proceeds of the PPP Loans are used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act and applicable implementing guidance issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the PPP. No assurance can be given that the Borrowers will obtain forgiveness of the PPP Loans in whole or in part.\nWith respect to any portion of any of the PPP Loans that is not forgiven under the terms of the PPP, such amounts will be subject to customary provisions for a loan of this type, including customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of the provisions of the applicable PPP Note and cross-defaults on any other loan with the Lender or other creditors.\nWe do not believe COVID-19 has had a material adverse effect on our access to supplies or labor, although there can be no assurance that there will not be a significant adverse impact on our supply chain or access to labor in the future. We are actively monitoring our food suppliers to assess how they are managing their operations to mitigate supply flow and food safety risks. To ensure we mitigate potential supply availability risk, we are building additional inventory back stock levels when appropriate and we have also identified alternative supply sources in key product categories including but not limited to food, sanitation and safety supplies.\nPrior to obtaining the PPP Loans, we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our loans with our unrelated third party institutional lender (the \u201cInstitutional Lender\u201d) under which as of October 3, 2020, we owe in the aggregate, approximately $12,209,000 (the \u201cInstitutional Loans\u201d). We determined that as of the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020, we were not in compliance with our financial covenants contained in the Institutional Loans related to the Rent Adjusted Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio because our consolidated debt during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020 increased due to our repayment obligations under the PPP Loans (the \u201cCovenant Breach\u2019). Pursuant to the terms of the Institutional Loans, the Covenant Breach, grants the Institutional Lender the right to exercise certain remedies under the Institutional Loans, including the right to accelerate the indebtedness owed by us to the Institutional Lender thereunder. On August 10, 2020, we received a written waiver of the Covenant Breach from the Institutional Lender, which, among other things, waives the Covenant Breach through June 30, 2021. As of October 3, 2020, we are in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our loans with our Institutional Lender.\nThere can be no assurances that we will be in compliance with our financial covenants thereafter due to, among other things, that our results of operations will likely continue to be materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Absent a waiver, failure to be in compliance with our financial covenants would constitute a default under the Institutional Loans with our Institutional Lender when reported. Such a default, if not cured or waived, would allow the Institutional Lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness we owe under the Institutional Loans, making it due and payable at the time. If maturity of the Institutional Loans were accelerated, it would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.\nNOTE 9. CASUALTY LOSS:\nDuring the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019, our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19) was damaged by a fire and was forced to close. Due to the damage caused by the fire, we determined that Store #19 should be demolished and rebuilt and as a result, the package liquor store and restaurant were closed for at least our fiscal years 2020 and 2019. We had insurance coverage of $1,975,000, in the aggregate, which our insurance carrier paid. We sustained a loss of $1,373,000 on our building and business personal property, against which we received insurance proceeds of $1,200,000 resulting in a loss of $173,000. We had a gain of $775,000 on our business interruption coverage, which when netted against our loss of $173,000 on our building and business personal property produced a gain of $602,000 during our fiscal year 2019.\nNOTE 10. LIQUOR LICENSES\nLiquor licenses, which are indefinite lived assets, are tested for impairment in September of each of our fiscal years. The fair value of liquor licenses at October 3, 2020, exceeded the carrying amount; therefore, we recognized no impairment loss. The fair value of the liquor licenses was evaluated by comparing the carrying value to recent sales for similar liquor licenses in the County issued. At October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the total carrying amount of our liquor licenses was $630,000. We acquired no liquor licenses in our fiscal year 2020.\nNOTE 11. INCOME TAXES\nThe components of our provision for income taxes for our fiscal years 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nA reconciliation of income tax computed at the statutory federal rate to income tax expense is as follows:\nWe have deferred tax assets which arise primarily due to depreciation recorded at different rates for tax and book purposes offset by cost basis differences in depreciable assets due to the deferral of the recognition of insurance recoveries on casualty losses for tax purposes, investments in and management fees paid by limited partnerships, accruals for potential uninsured claims, bonuses accrued for book purposes but not paid within two and a half months for tax purposes, the capitalization of certain inventory costs for tax purposes not recognized for financial reporting purposes, the recognition of revenue from gift cards not redeemed within twelve months of issuance, allowances for uncollectable receivables, unfunded limited retirement commitments and tax credit carryforwards generated as a result of the application of alternative minimum taxes.\nThe components of our deferred tax assets at October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019 were as follows:\nNOTE 12. DEBT\nLong-Term Debt\nLong-term debt at October 3, 2020 matures as follows:\nPrior to obtaining the PPP Loans, we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our loans with our unrelated third party institutional lender (the \u201cInstitutional Lender\u201d) under which as of October 3, 2020, we owe in the aggregate, approximately $12,209,000 (the \u201cInstitutional Loans\u201d). We determined that as of the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020, we were not in compliance with our financial covenants contained in the Institutional Loans related to the Rent Adjusted Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio because our consolidated debt during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020 increased due to our repayment obligations under the PPP Loans (the \u201cCovenant Breach\u2019). Pursuant to the terms of the Institutional Loans, the Covenant Breach, grants the Institutional Lender the right to exercise certain remedies under the Institutional Loans, including the right to accelerate the indebtedness owed by us to the Institutional Lender thereunder. On August 10, 2020, we received a written waiver of the Covenant Breach from the Institutional Lender, which, among other things, waives the Covenant Breach through June 30, 2021. As of October 3, 2020, we are in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our loans with our Institutional Lender.\nThere can be no assurances that we will be in compliance with our financial covenants thereafter due to, among other things, that our results of operations will likely continue to be materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Absent a waiver, failure to be in compliance with our financial covenants would constitute a default under the Institutional Loans with our Institutional Lender when reported. Such a default, if not cured or waived, would allow the Institutional Lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness we owe under the Institutional Loans, making it due and payable at the time. If maturity of the Institutional Loans were accelerated, it would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.\nNOTE 13. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER MATTERS\nConstruction Contracts\na. 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19)\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated architect for design and development services totaling $77,000 for the re-build of our restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19) which has been closed since October 2018 due to damages caused by a fire, of which $62,000 has been paid. Additionally, during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated general contractor for site work at this location totaling $1,618,000, (i) to connect the real property where this restaurant operated (Store #19) to city sewer and (ii) to construct a new building on the adjacent parcel of real property for the operation of a package liquor store. During our fiscal year 2020, we agreed to change orders to the agreement for additional construction services increasing the total contract price by $112,000 to $1,730,000, of which $-0- has been paid through October 3, 2020. Subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2020, we agreed to additional change orders to the agreement for additional price by $28,000 to $1,757,000, of which $64,000 has been paid.\nb. 14301 W. Sunrise Boulevard, Sunrise, Florida (Store #85)\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated design group for design and development services of our new location at 14301 W. Sunrise Boulevard, Sunrise, Florida 33323 (Store #85) for a total contract price of $122,000. During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020, we agreed upon changes to the agreement for additional design and development services which had the effect of increasing the total contract price of the same by $18,000 to $140,000, of which $106,000 has been paid. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2020, we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated general contractor for interior renovations at this location totaling $1,236,000, of which $-0- has been paid through October 3, 2020. Subsequent to October 3, 2020, $111,000 has been paid.\nNOTE 13. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER MATTERS (Continued)\nLegal Matters\nOur sale of alcoholic beverages subjects us to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes, which allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We currently have no \u201cdram shop\u201d claims pending.\nWe are a party to various other claims, legal actions and complaints arising in the ordinary course of our business. It is our opinion that all such matters are without merit or involve such amounts that an unfavorable disposition would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nLeases\nTo conduct certain of our operations, we lease restaurant and package liquor store space in South Florida from unrelated third parties. Our leases have remaining lease terms of up to 10 years, some of which include options to renew and extend the lease terms for up to an additional 30 years. We presently intend to renew some of the extension options available to us and for purposes of computing the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities required by ASC 842, we have incorporated into all lease terms which may be extended, an additional term of the lesser of (i) the amount of years the lease may be extended; or (ii) 15 years.\nFollowing adoption of ASC 842, common area maintenance and property taxes are not considered to be lease components.\nThe components of lease expense are as follows:\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases as follows:\nThe following table outlines the minimum future lease payments for the next five years and thereafter:\nTotal rent expense for all of our operating leases was approximately $3,963,000 in our fiscal year 2019 and is included in \u201cOccupancy Costs\u201d in our accompanying consolidated statements of income. The total rent expense is comprised of the following:\nPurchase Commitments\nIn order to fix the cost and ensure adequate supply of baby back ribs for our restaurants during calendar year 2021, on November 9, 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement with our current rib supplier, whereby we agreed to purchase approximately $6,420,000 of baby back ribs during calendar year 2021 from this vendor at a fixed cost.\nWhile we anticipate purchasing all of our rib supply from this vendor, we believe that several other alternative vendors are available, if necessary.\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2020, we temporarily suspended the operation of the Flanigan\u2019s Fish Company, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (\u201cFFC\u201d) due to the decrease in demand for imported fresh fish caused by restrictions placed upon the operation of our restaurants due to COVID-19, relying instead on outside fresh fish purveyors. The suspension of operations lasted approximately 5 \u00bd weeks, after which we resumed operations. As of October 3, 2020, FFC supplies certain of the fish to all of our restaurants. Since we hold the controlling interest of FFC, the balance sheet and operating results of this entity are consolidated into the accompanying financial statements of the Company, but eliminated upon consolidation. Sales and purchases of fish are recognized in restaurant food sales and restaurant and lounges (cost of merchandise sold), respectively, in the consolidated statements of income at the time of sale to the restaurant. In addition, the 49% of FFC owned by the unrelated third party is recognized as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 13. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER MATTERS (Continued)\nPurchase of Limited Partnership Interests\nDuring our fiscal year 2020, we did not purchase any limited partnership interests. During our fiscal year 2019, we purchased from one limited partner (who is not an officer, director or family member of officers or directors) a limited partnership interest of 0.63% in a limited partnership which owns a restaurant, for a purchase price of $4,800.\nFranchise Program\nAt October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019, we were the franchisor of five units under franchise agreements. Of the five franchised stores, three are combination restaurant/package liquor stores and two are restaurants (one of which we operate). Four franchised stores are owned and operated by related parties as follows:\n\u2022 James G. Flanigan, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company, and Michael B. Flanigan, a member of our Board of Directors and James G. Flanigan\u2019s brother, are each a 35.24% owner of a company which has a franchise arrangement with us for the operation of a restaurant and adjacent package liquor store located in Coconut Grove, Florida (Store #18).\n\u2022 Patrick J. Flanigan, brother to both James G. Flanigan and Michael B. Flanigan and a member of our Board of Directors, owns 100% of a company which has a franchise arrangement with us for the operation of a combination restaurant/package liquor store located in Pompano Beach, Florida (Store #43).\n\u2022 Our officers and directors collectively own 30% of the shareholder interest of a company which has a franchise arrangement with us for the operation of a restaurant located in Deerfield Beach, Florida. The shareholder interest of James G. Flanigan\u2019s family represents an additional 60% of the total invested capital in this franchised location (Store #14).\n\u2022 Patrick J. Flanigan is the sole general partner and a 25% limited partner in a limited partnership which has a franchise arrangement with us for the operation of a restaurant located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The Company is a 25% limited partner in this limited partnership and officers and directors of the Company (excluding Patrick J. Flanigan) own an additional 31.9% limited partnership interest in this franchised location (Store #15).\nUnder the franchise agreements, we provide guidance, advice and management assistance to the franchisees. In addition and for an additional annual fee of approximately $25,000, we also act as fiscal agent for the franchisees whereby we collect all revenues and pay all expenses and distributions. We also, from time to time, advance\nNOTE 13. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER MATTERS (Continued)\nFranchise Program (Continued)\nfunds on behalf of the franchisees for the cost of renovations. The resulting amounts receivable from and payable to these franchisees are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or a liability. We also agree to sponsor and manage cooperative buying groups on behalf of the franchisees for the purchase of inventory. The franchise agreements provide for royalties to us of approximately 3% of gross restaurant sales and 1% of gross package liquor sales. During our fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we earned royalties of $666,000 and $751,000, respectively, from our related franchises. We are not currently offering or accepting new franchises.\nEmployment Agreements/Bonuses\nAs of October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019, we had no employment agreements.\nOur Board of Directors approved an annual performance bonus, with 14.75% of the corporate pre-tax net income, plus or minus non-recurring items, but before depreciation and amortization in excess of $650,000 paid to the Chief Executive Officer and 5.25% paid to other members of management. Bonuses for our fiscal years 2020 and 2019 amounted to approximately $933,000 and $1,444,000, respectively.\nOur Board of Directors also approved an annual performance bonus, with 5% of the pre-tax net income before depreciation and amortization from our restaurants in excess of $1,875,000 and our share of the pre-tax net income before depreciation and amortization from the restaurants owned by the limited partnerships paid to the Chief Operating Officer and 5% paid to the Chief Financial Officer. Bonuses for our fiscal years 2020 and 2019 amounted to approximately $679,000 and $970,000, respectively.\nManagement Agreements\nDeerfield Beach, Florida\nSince January 2006, we have managed \u201cThe Whale\u2019s Rib\u201d, a casual dining restaurant located in Deerfield Beach, Florida, pursuant to a management agreement. We paid $500,000 in exchange for our rights to manage this restaurant. The management agreement was amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the initial term of the agreement, ten (10) years. The restaurant is owned by a third party unaffiliated with us. In exchange for providing management, bookkeeping and related services, we receive one-half (\u00bd) of the net profit, if any, from the operation of the restaurant. During the third quarter of our fiscal year 2011, the term of the management agreement was extended through January 9, 2036. For the fiscal years ended October 3, 2020 and September 28, 2019, we generated $150,000 and $375,000 of revenue respectively, from providing these management services.\nNOTE 14. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nWe follow FASB (ASC) Topic 820, \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d, for financial assets and liabilities and for non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on at least an annual basis. Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of non-performance. Topic 820 establishes a fair market hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Topic 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\n\u2022 Level 1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\u2022 Level 2 Inputs -- Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable through correlation with market data. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and inputs to evaluation models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment because the inputs used in the model, such as interest rates and volatility, can be corroborated by readily observable market data.\n\u2022 Level 3 Inputs -- One or more significant inputs that are unobservable and supported by little or no market activity, and that reflect the use of significant management judgment. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined \tusing pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, and significant management judgment or estimation.\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nAt October 3, 2020, we had two variable rate debt instruments outstanding that are impacted by changes in interest rates. The interest rate of both variable rate debt instruments is equal to the lender\u2019s LIBOR Rate plus two and one-quarter percent (2.25%) per annum. The debt instruments further provide that the \u201cLIBOR Rate\u201d is a rate of interest equal to the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate or successor thereto approved by the lender if the British Bankers Association is no longer making a LIBOR rate available. In January, 2013, we refinanced the mortgage loan encumbering the property where our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 4 N. Federal Highway, Hallandale, Florida, (Store #31) operates, which mortgage loan is held by an unaffiliated third party lender (the \u201c$1.405M Loan\u201d). In December, 2016, we closed on a secured revolving line of credit which entitled us to borrow, from time to time through December 28, 2017, up to $5,500,000 (the \u201cCredit Line\u201d), which on December 28, 2017 converted to the term loan (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d).\nNOTE 14. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n(Continued)\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements (Continued)\nAs a means of managing our interest rate risk on these debt instruments, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with our unrelated third party lender to convert these variable rate debt obligations to fixed rates. We are currently party to the following two (2) interest rate swap agreements:\n(i) One (1) interest rate swap agreement entered into in January, 2013 relates to the $1.405M Loan (the \u201c$1.405M Term Loan Swap\u201d). The $1.405M Term Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for a twenty (20) year period at a fixed rate of 4.35% on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of $1,405,000, while receiving interest for the same period at LIBOR - 1 Month, plus 2.25%, on the same amortizing notional principal amount. We determined that at October 3, 2020, the interest rate swap agreement is an effective hedging agreement and the fair value was not material; and\n(ii) The second interest rate swap agreement entered into in December, 2016, which became effective December 28, 2017, relates to the Credit Line (the \u201cLine of Credit Swap\u201d). The Line of Credit Swap requires us to pay interest for a five (5) year period, commencing December 28, 2017 at a fixed rate of 4.61% on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of $5,500,000, while receiving interest for the same period at LIBOR - 1 Month, plus 2.25%, on the same amortizing notional principal amount. We determined that at October 3, 2020, the interest rate swap agreement is an effective hedging agreement and the fair value was not material.\nNOTE 15. COMMON STOCK\nTreasury Stock\nPurchase of Common Shares\nDuring our fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock. As of October 3, 2020, we still have authority to purchase 65,414 shares of our common stock under the discretionary plan approved by the Board of Directors on May 17, 2007. Our current repurchase plan has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions, up to a purchase price of price of $15 per share.\nNOTE 16. BUSINESS SEGMENTS\nWe operate principally in two reportable segments - package stores and restaurants. The operation of package stores consists of retail liquor sales and related items. Information concerning the revenues and operating income for our fiscal years ended 2020 and 2019, and identifiable assets for the two reportable segments in which we operate, are shown in the following table. Operating income is total revenue less cost of merchandise sold and operating expenses relative to each segment. In computing operating income, none of the following items have been included: interest expense, other non-operating income and expense and income taxes. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets that are used in our operations in each segment. Corporate assets are principally cash and real property, improvements, furniture, equipment and vehicles used at our corporate headquarters. We do not have any operations outside of the United States and transactions between restaurants and package liquor stores are not material.\nNOTE 16. BUSINESS SEGMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 17. QUARTERLY INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)\nThe following is a summary of our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the quarters in our fiscal years 2020 and 2019.\nQuarterly operating results are not necessarily representative of our operations for a full year for various reasons including the seasonal nature of both the restaurant and package store segments.\nNOTE 18. 401(k) PLAN\nEffective July 2004, we began sponsoring a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Employees may contribute elective deferrals to the plan up to amounts allowed under the Internal Revenue Code. We are not required to contribute to the plan but may make discretionary profit sharing and matching contributions. During our fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we made discretionary contributions of $81,000 and $74,000, respectively.\nNOTE 19. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nMenu Price Increases\nEffective November 29, 2020 we increased menu prices for our bar offerings to target an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 1.83% annually and effective December 6, 2020 we increased menu prices for our food offerings to target an increase to our food revenues of approximately 2.45% annually to offset higher food costs and higher overall expenses. Prior to these increases, we previously raised menu prices in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2019.\nExercise of Options to Purchase\nNorth Lauderdale, Florida (\u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d/\u201dBig Daddy\u2019s Liquors\u201d)\nOn October 7, 2014, we entered into an Amendment to Lease Agreement (the \u201cLease Amendment\u201d) with a non-affiliated third party from whom we rent approximately 4,600 square feet of commercial space located at 5450 N. State Road 7, North Lauderdale, Florida where we operate a combination \u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d restaurant and \u201cBig Daddy\u2019s Liquors\u201d package liquor store (Store #40). The Lease Amendment extended the term of the Lease Agreement until December 31, 2020 and granted us the option to purchase, (the \u201cOption to Purchase\u201d), the real property and improvements on December 31, 2020 for $1,200,000. During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2020 we exercised the Option to Purchase and closed on December 31, 2020. We paid all cash at closing.\nSunrise, Florida (\u201cFlanigan\u2019s Seafood Bar and Grill\u201d)\nDuring the second quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into a Lease Agreement (the \u201cSunrise Lease Agreement\u201d) with a non-affiliated third party to rent approximately 6,900 square feet of commercial space located at 14301 W. Sunrise Boulevard, Sunrise, Florida where, subject to certain conditions, we anticipate opening a new restaurant location. The Sunrise Lease Agreement grants us an option to purchase, (the \u201cOption to Purchase\u201d) the real property and improvements by February 28, 2021. During the third quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we assigned the Sunrise Lease Agreement, excluding the Option to Purchase, to a newly formed limited partnership. Subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2020, we exercised the Option to Purchase and anticipate closing during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2021. We intend to pay all cash at closing.\nGeneral Liability Insurance; Excess Insurance\nFor the policy year beginning December 30, 2020, we bound general liability insurance with an unrelated third party insurance carrier which incorporates a deductible of $10,000 per occurrence for both us and the limited partnerships. Our insurance carrier is responsible for $1,000,000 coverage per occurrence above our deductible, up to a maximum aggregate of $2,000,000 per year. We were also able to bind excess liability insurance at a reasonable premium, whereby our excess insurance carrier is responsible for $10,000,000 coverage above our primary general liability insurance coverage. We are uninsured against liability claims in excess of $11,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate.
