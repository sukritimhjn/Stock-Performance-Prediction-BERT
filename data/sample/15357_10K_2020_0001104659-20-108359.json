    "item_1": "ITEM 1 BUSINESS\nChase General Corporation was incorporated November 6, 1944 for the purpose of manufacturing confectionery products. In 1970, Chase General Corporation acquired a 100% interest in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dye Candy Company. (Chase General Corporation and Dye Candy Company are sometimes referred herein as the Company). This subsidiary is the main operating company for the reporting entity.\nPrincipal Products and Methods of Distribution\nThe subsidiary, Dye Candy Company, operates two divisions, Chase Candy Products and Seasonal Candy Products. Chase Candy Products involve production and sale of a candy bar marketed under the trade name \u201cCherry Mash\u201d. The Seasonal Candy Products involve production and sale of coconut, peanut, chocolate, and fudge confectioneries. The products of both divisions are sold to the same type of customers in the same geographical areas. In addition, both divisions share a common labor force and utilize the same basic equipment and raw materials. Management considers these two divisions as one reportable segment for inclusion in this filing.\nThe principal products produced are as follows:\nChase Candy Products of Dye Candy Company produces a candy bar under the trade name of \u201cCherry Mash\u201d. The bar is distributed in the following case sizes:\n(1) 60 count pack\n(2) 12 boxes of 24 bars per box\n(3) 200 count shipper box\n(4) 100 count shipper box\n(5) 100 # 2 box Counter Display\nIn addition to the regular size bar, a \u201cmini-mash\u201d is distributed in the following case sizes:\n(1) 24 - 12 oz. bags\n(2) 6 jars - 60 bars per jar\n(3) 23 # wrapped bars\n(4) 22 # unwrapped bars\n(5) 12 - 12 oz. bags\n(6) 3 - 4 # jars\n(7) 24 - 12 oz. clamshell containers\n(8) 9 - 8 oz. clamshell containers\n(2)\nChase General Corporation and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nITEM 1 BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nPrincipal Products and Methods of Distribution (Continued)\nSeasonal Candy Products of Dye Candy Company produces coconut, peanut, chocolate, and fudge confectioneries and purchases other outsourced products. These products are distributed in bulk or packaged. Principal products include:\n(1) Coconut Bon-Bons (6) Peanut Brittle\n(2) Coconut Stacks (7) Peanut Clusters\n(3) Home Style Poe Fudge (8) Champion Cr\u00e9me Drops\n(4) Peco Flake (9) Jelly Candies\n(5) Peanut Squares (10) Frosted Pretzels\nThe Champion Cr\u00e8me Drops, Frosted Pretzels, and Jelly Candies are not produced by the Company.\nAll products are shipped to customers by commercial haulers.\nCompetition and Market Area\nThe Chase Candy Products division bars are sold primarily to wholesale candy and tobacco jobbing houses, grocery accounts, vendors, and repackers. \u201cCherry Mash\u201d bars are marketed in the Midwest region of the United States. For the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, this division accounted for 57% and 58%, respectively, of the consolidated sales of Dye Candy Company.\nThe Seasonal Candy Products division is sold primarily on a Midwest regional basis to national syndicate accounts, repackers, and grocery accounts. For the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, this division accounted for 43% and 46%, respectively of the consolidated sales of Dye Candy Company.\nThe Company has no government contracts, foreign operations or export sales. In addition, all domestic sales are primarily in the Midwest region of the United States.\nThe Company is a seasonal business whereby the largest volume of sales occur in August through December of each year. The earnings per quarter of the Company varies in direct proportion to the seasonal sales volume.\nDue to the seasonal nature of the business, there is a heavier demand on working capital in the fall and winter months of the year when the Company is building its inventories in anticipation of August through December sales. The fluctuation of demand on working capital due to the seasonal nature of the business is common to the confectionery industry. If necessary, the Company has the ability to borrow short-term funds to finance operations prior to receiving cash collections from fall sales. The Company occasionally offers extended payment terms of up to sixty days. Since this practice is infrequent, the effect on working capital is minimal.\n(3)\nChase General Corporation and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nITEM 1 BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nCompetition and Market Area (Continued)\nPrompt service and efficient service are traits demanded in the confectionery industry, which results in a continual low volume of back-orders. Therefore, at no time during the year does the Company have a significant amount of back-orders.\nThe confectionery (candy) market for the type of product produced by the divisions of Dye Candy Company is very competitive and quality minded. The confectionery industry in which the divisions operate is highly competitive with many small companies and, within certain specialized areas, a few competitors dominate. In the United States, the dominant competitors in the coconut candy industry are Crown Candy Company, Vermico Candy Company, and the Seasonal Candy Products division of Dye Candy Company with approximately 70% of the market share among them. In the United States, Old Dominion has approximately 80% of the market share of the peanut candy business in which the Seasonal Candy Products division operates. Dye Candy Company sells approximately 95% of its products in the Midwest region with seasonal orders being shipped to the Southern and Eastern regions of the United States. Except for the coconut candy industry, Dye Candy Company is not a dominant competitor in any of the candy industries in which it competes. Dye Candy Company\u2019s market share in the coconut industry does not vary significantly from year to year.\nPrincipal methods of competition the Company uses include quality of product, price, reduced transportation costs due to central location, and service. The Company\u2019s competitive position is positively influenced by labor costs being lower than industry average. Chase General Corporation is firmly established in the confectionery market and through its operating divisions has many years of experience associated with its name.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company has not developed any new products for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.\nRaw Materials and Principal Suppliers\nRaw materials and packaging materials are produced on a national basis with products coming from locations throughout the United States. Raw materials and packaging materials are generally widely available, depending on common market influences. No suppliers accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s cost of sales for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.\nPatents and Trademarks\nThe largest single revenue producing product, the \u201cCherry Mash\u201d bar, is protected by a trademark registered with The United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company considers this trademark significant to operations. This trademark expires in the year 2023. The Company and its legal representatives do not expect any impediment to renewing this trademark prior to its expiration.\n(4)\nChase General Corporation and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nITEM 1 BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nEmployees\nAs of June 30, 2020, the Company had 18 full time employees. This expands to approximately 30 full time personnel during the busy production months of August through December.\nCustomers\nFor the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, one customer accounted for 45% and 42%, respectively, of sales. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, that same customer accounted for 14% and 18%, respectively, of trade receivables. For the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, another customer and its affiliates accounted for 8% and 10%, respectively, of sales. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, that same customer and its affiliates accounted for 23% and 21%, respectively, of trade receivables. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s sales for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. One other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s trade receivables for the year ended June 30, 2020.\nEnvironmental Protection and the Effect on Probable Government Regulations on the Business\nTo the best of management\u2019s knowledge, the Company is presently in compliance with all environmental laws and regulations and does not anticipate any future expenditures in this regard. The Company has evaluated the requirements of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). The FSMA aims to ensure the U.S. food supply is safe by shifting the focus of federal regulators from responding to contamination to preventing it. The FSMA has given the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) new authorities to regulate the way foods are grown, harvested, and processed. As of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and through the filing of this form, management believes the Company is compliant with all FSMA requirements. Another inspection for compliance will be conducted by a third-party within 12 months of year-end. Management does not anticipate any future significant expenditures in the next twelve months in this regard.\nNeed for Government Approval of Principal Products or Services\nThe Company is required to meet the Food and Drug Administration guidelines for proper labeling of its products and for contents of its products. Management does not anticipate any future significant expenditures in the next twelve months in this regard.\nReports to Security Holders\nThe Registrant is not required to send the annual audit report, annual 10-K report and quarterly 10-Q reports to security holders since the stock is not actively traded. These reports are available at the Registrant\u2019s registered office or they are available on-line on the SEC\u2019s EDGAR website.\n(5)\nChase General Corporation and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020",

Forward-looking statements may include statements about the future of our products and the industry, statements about our future business plans and strategies, and other statements that are not historical in nature. In this report, forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d and the like. Readers should carefully review these cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These forward-looking statements are based on the information available to, and the expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by, the Company at the time the statements are made. These expectations, assumptions, and uncertainties include: the Company\u2019s expectation of heavier demand on working capital in the fall and winter months in anticipation of August through December sales; our belief that the Company has stabilized its customer base; will continue its efforts to expand the existing market area and increase sales to customers; and maintain tight control of all expenditures.\nOverview\nDuring fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, the Company\u2019s sales were $2,576,311, as compared to sales of $2,520,633 for fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. This 2.2% increase in volume, 3.6% increase in cost of sales and 14.7% increase in operating expenses resulted in a change in profitability during the year, as reflected in the loss from operations of $144,491 for fiscal year 2020 compared to the loss from operations of $33,184 for fiscal year 2019. Working capital decreased $68,803 to $289,619 for the fiscal year 2020 from $358,422 for the fiscal year 2019 due primarily to a decrease in inventory and an increase in the current portion of lease liability offset by an increase in cash, a decrease in accounts payable, a decrease in the current portion of notes payable, a decrease in accrued expenses, an increase in trade receivables, and a decrease in refund liability owed to customers.\nThe following information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein.\n(8)\nChase General Corporation and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nItem 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nManagement\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nGeneral (Continued)\nThe Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.\nThere have been no other events that have occurred subsequent to June 30, 2020, through the date of filing this form, that would require disclosure in the Form 10-K or would be required to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as of or for the year ended June 30, 2020.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenues as product is shipped to customers. Sales are comprised of the total sales billed during the period, including shipping and handling charges to the customer, less the estimated returns, customer allowances, and customer discounts.\nTrade Receivables\nTrade receivables are uncollateralized customer obligations which generally require payment within thirty days from the invoice date. Trade receivables are stated at the invoice amount as no interest is charged to the customer for any past due amounts. Payments of trade receivables are applied to the specific invoices identified on the customer\u2019s remittance advice or, if unspecified, to the earliest unpaid invoices.\nThe carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects management\u2019s best estimate of amounts that will not be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management\u2019s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the trade receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer\u2019s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than the historical experience, management\u2019s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the Company could be adversely affected. All accounts or portions thereof deemed to be uncollectible, or to require an excessive collection cost, are written off to the allowance for doubtful accounts.\n(9)\nChase General Corporation and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nItem 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nInventories\nInventories are carried at the \u201clower of cost or net realizable value,\u201d with cost being determined on the \u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d basis of accounting. The cost of goods in process include an estimate for manufacturing overhead. Finished goods inventory are valued using the lower of cost or market value, determined by the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of finished goods inventory at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts of such assets to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.\nNew Accounting Guidance\nSee Note 1, RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth for the years indicated, the percentage of sales of certain items in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively:\n(10)\nChase General Corporation and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nItem 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019\nSales\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2020, sales, net of returns and allowances, increased $55,678 or 2.2% as compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Sales for Chase Candy products increased $72,099 or 5.1% to $1,480,286 for the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to $1,408,187 for 2019. Sales for Seasonal Candy products decreased $16,421 or 1.5% to $1,096,025 for the year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to $1,112,446 for 2019.\nSales for Chase Candy consisted of the following divisions: L276 Cherry Mash Distributor Pack division, Cherry Mash Merchandisers division, L260 Changemaker Jar division, L279/L299 Bulk Mini Mash division, and L278/L212 Mini Mash division. The 5.1% increase in sales of Chase Candy of $72,099 for the year ended June 30, 2020 over the same period ended June 30, 2019, is primarily due to the following: 1) increased sales of Cherry Mash Merchandisers division by approximately $48,000 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to an increase in orders from existing customers, 2) increased sales of the L278/L212 Mini Mash division by approximately $15,000 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to an increase in orders from existing customers, 3) increased sales of the L276 Cherry Mash Distributor Pack division by approximately $13,000 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to an increase in orders from existing customers, 4) increased sales of the Cherry Mash internet sales via the Company\u2019s website by approximately $5,500 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to an increase in orders from existing customers, 5) increased sales of the L279/L299 Bulk Mini Mash division by approximately $3,500 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to an increase in orders from existing customers 6) various other fluctuations netting to an increase of approximately $500; offset by 7) an increase in promotions expenses allocated to the Chase Candy division of approximately $9,000 primarily due selling more items with higher promotion fees associated with them; and 8) an increase in advertising expense allocated to the Chase Candy division of approximately $4,500 primarily due the increase in costs on regularly advertised markets.\nSales for Seasonal Candy consisted of the following divisions: bulk seasonal division, clamshell seasonal division, and the generic seasonal division. The 2.2% decrease in sales of Seasonal Candy of $16,421 for the year ended June 30, 2020 over the same period ended June 30, 2019, is primarily due to the net effect of the following: 1) decreased sales in the generic seasonal division by approximately $14,500 due to decreased orders from existing customers, 2) decreased sales in the bulk seasonal division by approximately $14,500 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to decreased orders from existing customers, and 3) various other fluctuations netting to a decrease of approximately $4,500; offset by 4) increased sales in the Chase clamshell seasonal division by approximately $17,000 versus the same period a year ago, primarily due to increased orders from existing customers.\n(11)\nChase General Corporation and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nItem 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019 (Continued)\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales for the year ended June 30, 2020, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2019, increased by 3.6%. The cost of sales increased $66,862 to $1,940,111 while increasing to 75.3% of sales for the year ended June 30, 2020, compared to $1,873,249 or 74.3% of sales for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nThe 3.6% increase in cost of sales of $66,862 is primarily due to the net impact of a 2% increase in sales of $55,678, a 3.9% increase in the price of sugar offset by a 5.1% decrease in the price of peanuts. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on the cost of sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. While sales did not fluctuate significantly during the fourth quarter compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2019, the related costs of $324,066 for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 increased 35% or $84,787 as compared to $239,279 for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 due to the costs associated with repurposing of finished goods inventory to adequately fill customer orders and realignment of staff during a period of decreased production.\nDue to volatility in the regions where these raw materials are grown, management anticipates the prices of these raw materials to continue to fluctuate primarily based on supply and demand. Management has plans to make sales price adjustments to correspond with changes in raw material prices.\nLabor costs, including wages, vacation pay and payroll taxes of $429,288 for the year ended June 30, 2020, decreased 2.8% or $12,610 as compared to $441,898 for the period ended 2019 primarily due to decreased production wages due to decreased hours, bonuses, and pay rates compared to the same period ended June 30, 2019.\nFreight expense, including shipping and handling costs on goods shipped of $142,220 for the year ended June 30, 2020, decreased 3.67% or $5,415 as compared to $147,635 for the period ended 2019 due primarily to changing carriers during the fiscal year.\nGross Profit on Sales\nThe gross profit decreased 1.7% or $11,184 to $636,200 decreasing to 24.7% of related sales for the year ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $647,834 or 25.7% of related sales for the year ended June 30, 2019, as a net result of the 3.6% increase in cost of sales described above and the 2.2% increase in sales.\nFinished goods inventory as of June 30, 2020 of $85,632 decreased $114,453 or 57.2% from the June 30, 2019 finished goods inventory of $200,085. Raw materials inventory as of June 30, 2020 of $65,555 increased $20,099 or 44.2% from the June 30, 2019 raw materials inventory of $45,456. Packaging materials inventory as of June 30, 2020 of $156,038 increased $4,243 or 2.8% from June 30, 2019 packaging materials inventory of $151,795. Goods in process inventory as of June 30, 2020 of $6,261 decreased $6,738 or 51.8% from the June 30, 2019 goods in process inventory of $12,999. Inventory levels vary based primarily on sales and purchases.\n(12)\nChase General Corporation and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nItem 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019 (Continued)\nSelling Expenses\nSelling expenses for the year ended June 30, 2020 increased $15,534 to $299,944, which is 11.6% of sales, compared to $284,410 or 11.3% of sales for the year June 30, 2019. This increase is primarily due to higher sales salaries, commissions, and customer shows. Sales salaries increased $12,163 to $110,745 for the year ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $98,582 for the year ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to annual raises for one of the salespersons. Commission expense increased $2,239 to $101,728 for the year ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $99,489 for the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to an increase in sales of items where the Company pays commissions. Trade show expense increased $2,104 to $8,653 for the year ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $6,549 for the year ended June 30, 2019, primarily due increased trade shows attended by the Company\u2019s vendors.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2020 increased $69,748 to $480,747, which is 18.7% of sales, compared to $410,999 or 16.3% of sales for the year ended June 30, 2019. The increase is primarily due to higher professional fees, indirect costs, office salaries, insurance expense, and bad debt expense. Professional fees increased $42,557 to $156,002 for the year ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $113,445 for the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to the Company\u2019s audit firm increasing their fees and an increase in attorney fees. During the current year, the Company began allocating indirect costs to general and administrative expenses that were previously allocated to cost of sales. This allocation is for the administrative portion of the office and totaled $13,500 for the year ended June 30, 2020. Office salaries increased $7,573 to $101,272 for the year ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $93,699 for the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to annual raises for employees. Insurance expense increased $4,116 to $130,980 for the year ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $126,864 for the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to more employees enrolled in the plan. Bad debt expense increased $3,134 to $2,594 for the year ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $(540) for the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to a write off of a receivable in the current year.\n(13)\nChase General Corporation and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nItem 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019 (Continued)\nLoss from Operations\nLoss from operations for the year ended June 30, 2020 was (5.6)% of sales, as compared to a loss from operations of (1.3)% of sales for the year ended June 30, 2019 for the reasons previously described.\nOther Expense\nOther expense reflects a net expense of $1,558 for the year ended June 30, 2020, as compared to net expense of $1,878 for the year ended June 30, 2019. This decrease of $320 in other expense was primarily due to a decrease in the interest expense.\nLoss before Income Taxes\nLoss before income taxes was $146,049 for the year ended June 30, 2020, as compared to a loss before income taxes of $35,062 for the year ended June 30, 2019. The reasons for the increase of $110,987 have been previously discussed.\nBenefit for Income Taxes\nThe Company recorded no income tax benefit for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. Additionally, the Company has placed a valuation allowance on the net operating loss carryforward of $361,181 for the current year after it was determined that the Company would not be likely to use the remaining balance in the near future.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the year ended June 30, 2020 was $146,049, compared to a net loss for the year ended June 30, 2019 of $35,062. This increase of $110,987 is the result of those items previously discussed.\nLiquidity and Sources of Capital\nThe table below presents the summary of cash flow for the fiscal year indicated.\n(14)\nChase General Corporation and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nItem 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019 (Continued)\nOperating Activities\nThe negative cash flow of $39,778 generated from operations is a result of a fluctuation in sales, decreases in inventory and the loss generated from operations. During the year ended June 30, 2020, sales, net of returns and allowances, increased $55,678, or 2.2% as compared to the year ended June 30, 2019. Total inventory as of June 30, 2020 of $313,486 decreased $96,849 or 23.6% from the June 30, 2019 total inventory of $410,335. Trade receivables as of June 30, 2020 of $144,239 increased $6,370 or 4.6% from the June 30, 2019 trade receivables of $137,869. The increase in the net loss caused by the increased operating expenses had the most impact on the negative cash flow from operations, however, this was offset by the decrease in inventory.\nInvesting Activities\nThe negative cash flow of $1,310 from investing is a result of equipment purchases made during the year ended June 30, 2019.\nFinancing Activities\nThe Company borrowed $227,000 and $425,000, respectively, on its line-of-credit during the fall of 2019 (fiscal 2020) and 2018 (fiscal 2019) busy seasons. Payments of $312,000 and $340,000, respectively, were paid for years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. The Company entered into a $350,000 line-of-credit agreement expiring on January 4, 2021, with a variable interest rate at prime but not less than 5%. The line-of-credit is collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company. Management anticipates renewal of the line-of-credit agreement at similar terms upon expiration.\nNotes payable principal payments were $12,132 and $17,935 for years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company received a loan in the amount of $171,500 to fund payroll, rent, utilities and interest on mortgages and existing debt through the federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The PPP note has a 1.00% per annum interest rate and is subject to terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the SBA under the CARES act, as amended by the PPP Flexibility Act. Monthly principal and interest payments, less the amount of any potential forgiveness (as discussed below) will commence on November 10, 2020. These amounts may be forgiven subject to compliance and approval based on the timing and use of these funds in accordance with the program.\nOverall cash and cash equivalents increased $34,590 to $53,390 at June 30, 2020 from $18,800 at June 30, 2019.\nAt June 30, 2020, the Company\u2019s accumulated deficit was $6,069,099, compared to an accumulated deficit of $5,923,050 as of June 30, 2019. Working capital as of June 30, 2020 decreased $68,803 to $289,619 from $358,422 as of June 30, 2019.\n(15)\nChase General Corporation and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nItem 7 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019 (Continued)\nLiquidity and Sources of Capital (Continued)\nFinancing Activities (Continued)\nThe Company\u2019s lease on its office and plant facility is effective through March 31, 2025, with an option to extend for an additional term of five years, and currently requires payments of $6,500 per month. At the end of each five year period, the base rent may be increased an amount not greater than 30%, at the sole discretion of lessor. The facility is leased from an entity that is partially owned by the son of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.\nIn order to maintain funds to finance operations and meet debt obligations, it is the intention of management to continue its efforts to expand the present market area and increase sales to its customers. Management also intends to continue tight control on all expenditures. Due to volatility in the regions where these raw materials are grown, management anticipates the prices of these raw materials to continue to fluctuate primarily based on supply and demand. Primarily due to the fluctuations in these raw material prices, gross margins have decreased due to unchanged sales prices during the period. Management intends to make sales price adjustments in the future to correspond with changes in raw material prices.",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standard\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the guidance of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, (\u201cASC 842\u201d) as of July 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition approach with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C.\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.\nKansas City, Missouri\nSeptember 24, 2020\n(18)\nCHASE GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nJUNE 30, 2020 AND 2019\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n(19)\nCHASE GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (CONTINUED)\nJUNE 30, 2020 AND 2019\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n(20)\nCHASE GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nYears Ended june 30, 2020 AND 2019\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n(21)\nCHASE GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nYears Ended june 30, 2020 AND 2019\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n(22)\nCHASE GENERAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nYears Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n(23)\nCHASE GENERAL CORPORATION and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nNOTE 1 NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Business\nChase General Corporation (the Company) was incorporated on November 6, 1944 in the state of Missouri for the purpose of manufacturing confectionery products. The Company grants credit terms to substantially all customers, consisting of repackers, grocery accounts, and national syndicate accounts, who are primarily located in the Midwest region of the United States.\nSignificant accounting policies are as follows:\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dye Candy Company. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nSegment Reporting of the Business\nThe subsidiary, Dye Candy Company, operates two divisions, Chase Candy Products and Seasonal Candy Products. Chase Candy Products involve production and sale of a candy bar marketed under the trade name \"Cherry Mash\". The Seasonal Candy Products involve production and sale of coconut, peanut, chocolate, and fudge confectioneries. The products of both divisions are sold to the same type of customers in the same geographical areas. In addition, both divisions share a common labor force and utilize the same basic equipment and raw materials. Management considers these two divisions as one reportable segment in these consolidated financial statements.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.\n(24)\nCHASE GENERAL CORPORATION and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nNOTE 1 NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nShipping and Handling Costs\nShipping and handling costs for freight expense on goods shipped are included in cost of sales. Freight expense on goods shipped for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 was $142,220 and $147,635, respectively.\nTrade Receivables\nTrade receivables are uncollateralized customer obligations which generally require payment within thirty days from the invoice date. Trade receivables are stated at the invoice amount as no interest is charged to the customer for any past due amounts. Payments of trade receivables are applied to the specific invoices identified on the customer\u2019s remittance advice or, if unspecified, to the earliest unpaid invoices.\nThe carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects management\u2019s best estimate of amounts that will not be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management\u2019s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the trade receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer\u2019s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than the historical experience, management\u2019s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the Company could be adversely affected. All accounts or portions thereof deemed to be uncollectible, or that require an excessive collection cost, are written off to the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nInventories\nFinished good, raw material and packaging material inventories are carried at the \u201clower of cost or net realizable value,\u201d with cost being determined on the \u201cfirst-in, first-out\u201d basis of accounting. The cost of goods in process include an estimate for manufacturing overhead. Finished goods inventory are valued using the lower of cost or market value, determined by the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of finished goods inventory at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.\nProperty and Equipment\nThe Company\u2019s property and equipment is recorded at cost and is being depreciated on straight-line and accelerated methods over the following estimated useful lives:\nBuildings 39 years\nMachinery and equipment 5 - 7 years\nTrucks and autos 5 years\nOffice equipment 5 - 7 years\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of estimated\nuseful life or the\nlease term\n(25)\nCHASE GENERAL CORPORATION and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nNOTE 1 NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.\nNotes Payable\nThe Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program Promissory Note further discussed in Note 3 is being accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 470, Debt. Under ASC 470, the initial recognition of the debt is a financial liability that accrues interest. Under ASC 470, derecognition of the liability will occur when the Company has been \u201clegally released\u201d or pays off the loan at which time forgiveness will be recorded as a gain on extinguishment.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are provided using the liability method for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax reporting. Temporary differences are differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities reported for financial statement purposes and their tax bases. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for temporary differences that will be deductible in future years\u2019 tax returns and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets are only recognized if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of relevant information. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will be taxable in future years\u2019 tax returns. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the dates of enactment. Based on the facts, the Company has determined it necessary to reduce their deferred income tax asset with a valuation allowance due it being more likely than not that the Company will be able to realize all of the deferred income tax asset.\nThe Company\u2019s policy is to evaluate uncertain tax positions under the guidance as prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company has not identified any uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements. The Company had no accruals for interest or penalties as of June 30, 2020 and 2019.\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share shall be computed by including contingently issuable shares with the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. When inclusion of the contingently issuable shares would have an antidilutive effect upon earnings per share, diluted earnings per share will be calculated in the same manner as basic earnings per share.\n(26)\nCHASE GENERAL CORPORATION and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nNOTE 1 NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nEarnings Per Common Share (Continued)\nThe following table details out the contingently issuable shares for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. For 2020 and 2019, the contingently issuable shares were not included in diluted earnings per common share as they would have an antidilutive effect upon earnings per share.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising is expensed when incurred. Advertising expense was $19,019 and $15,603 for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company follows ASU No. 2014-15, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)\u201d. ASU 2014-15 provides guidance related to management\u2019s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosure for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. Management determined that, when considered in the aggregate, the current conditions and events, including the COVID-19 pandemic impact, do not raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are available for issuance.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our revenue is derived by fulfilling customer orders for the purchase of our products, including 1) a candy bar marketed under the trade name Cherry Mash and 2) coconut, peanut, chocolate, and fudge confectioneries. The Company recognizes revenue at the point in time that control of the ordered product(s) is transferred to the customer, which is typically upon shipment to the customer. Shipping and handling costs incurred to ship product to the customer are recorded within cost of sales. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as accounts receivables on the balance sheet and require payment on a short-term basis. Generally, individual orders from customers are accounted for as a single performance obligation.\n(27)\nCHASE GENERAL CORPORATION and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nNOTE 1 NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nRevenue Recognition (Continued)\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for fulfilling product orders. Sales, value add, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. The amount of consideration the Company expects to receive and revenue the Company recognizes includes estimates of variable consideration, including costs for trade promotional programs, customer incentives, and allowances and discounts associated with aged or potentially unsaleable products. These estimates are based upon our analysis of the programs offered, historical trends, and expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, sales and payment trends and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past. The Company reviews and updates these estimates regularly and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified. The adjustments recognized for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 resulting from updated estimates of revenue for prior year product sales were not significant. The company has elected a practical expedient to recognize incremental costs incurred to obtain contracts, which primarily represent sales commissions where the amortization period would be less than one year, as a selling expense when incurred in the financial statements\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s products are confectionery and confectionery-based and, therefore, exhibit similar economic characteristics, such that they are based on similar ingredients and are marketed and sold through the same channels to the same customers. The Company operates two divisions, Chase Candy Products and Seasonal Candy Products. Chase Candy Products involve production and sale of a candy bar marketed under the trade name \u201cCherry Mash\u201d. The Seasonal Candy Products involve production and sale of coconut, peanut, chocolate, and fudge confectioneries. Both divisions share a common labor force and utilize the same basic equipment and raw materials. Management considers these two divisions as one reportable segment. The various divisions of revenue are as follows:\n(28)\nCHASE GENERAL CORPORATION and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nNOTE 1 NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nRecently Adopted Pronouncements (Continued)\nThe Company adopted the guidance of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, (ASC 842) as of July 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition approach with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application. The comparative information in the prior year has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 840, Leases, which was the accounting standard in effect for that period. The new standard establishes a right-of-use model (ROU) that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all, and disclose key leasing information. The Company elected a package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which among other things, allows us to carryforward the historical lease classification, and exclude from balance sheet reporting those leases with initial terms of 12 months or less. Leases are classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement. Adoption of the new standard on July 1, 2019 resulted in the recording of operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities in the amount of $376,105. The standard did not materially affect the Company\u2019s consolidated net income or cash flows. See Note 8-Commitments, Contingencies, and Related Party Transactions for the required disclosures of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.\nRecently Issued Pronouncements\nThere have been no newly issued or newly applicable accounting pronouncements that have, or are expected to have, a significant impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 2 FORGIVABLE LOAN AND DEFERRED INCOME\nDuring 2004, the Company received a $25,000 economic development incentive from Buchanan County, which is a five-year forgivable loan at a rate of $5,000 per year. The Nodaway Valley Bank established an Irrevocable Standby Letter of Credit in the amount of $25,000 as collateral for this loan, with a maturity date of January 3, 2010. The Company met the criteria of occupying a 20,000 square foot building and creating a minimum of two new full-time equivalent jobs during the first year of operation in the new facility. In addition, the Company maintained 19 existing jobs during the five-year term. Notice was received February 6, 2009 from the Buchanan County Commission, that the Company had fulfilled its minimum loan requirements so that the loan was forgiven in full and has no further obligations. Since the Company was no longer legally required to return the monies, the liability was reclassified as deferred revenue and amortized into income over the life of the lease term of the new facility. Deferred revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term of 20 years. During the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, deferred revenue of $1,299 was amortized into income.\n(29)\nCHASE GENERAL CORPORATION and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nNOTE 3 NOTES PAYABLE\nThe Company\u2019s long-term debt at June 30, 2020 and 2019 consists of:\nFuture minimum payments for the years ended June 30 are:\n(30)\nCHASE GENERAL CORPORATION and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nNOTE 4 CAPITAL STOCK\nCapital stock authorized, issued, and outstanding as of June 30, 2020 is as follows:\nCumulative Preferred Stock dividends in arrears at June 30, 2020 and 2019 totaled $8,461,094 and $8,333,022, respectively. Total dividends in arrears, on a per share basis, consist of the following at June 30, 2020 and 2019:\nThe 6% convertible prior cumulative preferred stock may, upon 30 days prior notice, be redeemed by the Corporation at $5.25 a share plus unpaid accrued dividends to date of redemption. In the event of voluntary liquidation, holders of this stock are entitled to receive $5.25 per share plus accrued dividends. Cumulative preferred stock may be exchanged for common stock at the option of the shareholders in the ratio of four common shares for one share of Series A and 3.75 common shares for one share of Series B.\nThe Company has the privilege of redemption of 5% convertible cumulative preferred stock at $21.00 a share plus unpaid accrued dividends. In the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, holders of this stock are entitled to receive $20.00 a share plus unpaid accrued dividends. It may be exchanged for common stock at the option of the shareholders, in the ratio of 3.795 common shares for one of preferred.\n(31)\nChase General Corporation and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nNOTE 5 INCOME TAXes\nManagement believes the income tax positions taken for open years are appropriately stated and supported for all open years. The Company\u2019s federal tax returns for the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service taxing authority.\nThe sources of deferred income tax assets and liability at June 30, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nThe net deferred income tax asset is presented in the accompanying June 30, 2020 and 2019 consolidated balance sheets as follows:\nThe benefit for income taxes for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 consists of the following:\n(32)\nCHASE GENERAL CORPORATION and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nNOTE 5 INCOME TAXes (CONTINUED)\nThe income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pretax loss for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 due to the following:\nThe Company has available at June 30, 2020, $361,181 of unused operating loss that may be carried forward and applied against future taxable income. Of the net operating loss carryforward, $15,902 expires on June 30, 2038, the remaining balance does not expire.\n(33)\nCHASE GENERAL CORPORATION and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nNOTE 6 LOSS PER SHARE\nThe loss per share for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was computed on the weighted average of outstanding common shares during the year as follows:\nContingently issuable shares were not included in the 2020 and 2019 diluted earnings per common share as they would have an antidilutive effect upon earnings per share.\nNOTE 7 SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION\n(34)\nCHASE GENERAL CORPORATION and Subsidiary\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nNOTE 8 COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company adopted ASC 842 on July 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method; and therefore, the comparative information has not been adjusted for the year ended June 30, 2019.\nThe Company leases its office and manufacturing facility, located at 1307 South 59th, St. Joseph, Missouri under an operating lease from an entity that is partially owned by the son of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The lease term is from February 1, 2005 through March 31, 2025 with an option to extend for an additional term of five years. The Company does not believe that exercise of the renewal option is reasonably assured, and has not included the additional five years in the lease term. The lease currently requires payments of $6,500 per month.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were recognized upon adoption of the lease standard based on the present value of minimum lease payments over the remaining lease term. The Company\u2019s operating lease has a remaining term of 5.5 years and the present value of the lease payments is calculated using the lessor\u2019s implicit rate of 6.43%. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company\u2019s lease agreement does not contain any residual value guarantees.
