    "item_1": "Item 1. BUSINESS\nProtective Insurance Corporation (referred to herein as \"Protective\") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Indiana in 1930. Through its subsidiaries, Protective engages in marketing and underwriting property, liability and workers' compensation coverage for trucking and public transportation fleets, as well as coverage for trucking industry independent contractors.\nProtective\u2019s principal subsidiaries are:\n1. Protective Insurance Company (referred to herein as \"Protective Insurance Co.\"), which is licensed by insurance authorities in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, all Canadian provinces and Puerto Rico;\n2. Protective Specialty Insurance Company (referred to herein as \"Protective Specialty\"), which is currently approved for excess and surplus lines business by insurance authorities in 48 states and the District of Columbia and licensed in Indiana;\n3. Sagamore Insurance Company (referred to herein as \"Sagamore\"), which is licensed by insurance authorities in 49 states and the District of Columbia and approved for excess and surplus lines business in one additional state;\n4. B&L Brokerage Services, Inc. (referred to herein as \"BLBS\"), an Indiana-domiciled insurance broker licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia; and\n5. B&L Insurance, Ltd. (referred to herein as \"BLI\"), which is domiciled and licensed in Bermuda.\nProtective Insurance Co., Protective Specialty, Sagamore and BLI are collectively referred to herein as the \"Insurance Subsidiaries.\" The \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our,\" as used herein, refer to Protective and all of its subsidiaries unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.\nAs is a common practice in the property and casualty insurance industry, the Insurance Subsidiaries share or \"cede\" portions of their gross premiums written with several non-affiliated reinsurers under excess of loss and quota share treaties covering predetermined groups of risks and by facultative (individual policy-by-policy) placements. Reinsurance is ceded to spread the risk of loss from individual claims or groups of claims among several reinsurers and is an integral part of the Company's business.\nIn 2020, the Insurance Subsidiaries primarily served the commercial automobile market, although the Insurance Subsidiaries continue to support previously written policies in markets for which the Company has discontinued writing business, and these operations are in run-off. The Company expects targeted growth to continue in its core business of commercial automobile and workers' compensation.\nThe Company operates as one reportable property and casualty insurance segment based on how its operating results are regularly reviewed by its chief operating decision maker when making decisions about how resources are to be allocated to the segment and assessing its performance.\nProposed Merger with The Progressive Corporation\nMerger Agreement\nOn February 14, 2021, Protective entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with The Progressive Corporation, an Ohio corporation (\u201cProgressive\u201d), and Carnation Merger Sub Inc., an Indiana corporation and wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Progressive (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d). The Merger Agreement provides for, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, the merger of Merger Sub with and into Protective (the \u201cMerger\u201d), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease and Protective will continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Progressive.\nProtective\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), at the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee of the Board, unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Protective and its shareholders, and approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The Merger is expected to close prior to the end of the third quarter of 2021. At the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, without par value, of Protective (other than each share of Protective\u2019s common stock that is owned by Protective as treasury stock or by any subsidiary of Protective and each share of Protective\u2019s common stock owned by Progressive, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Progressive immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive $23.30 in cash, without interest, for a total transaction value of approximately $338 million.\nThe Merger Agreement contains various customary representations and warranties from each of Protective, Progressive and Merger Sub. Protective has also agreed to various customary covenants, including but not limited to conducting its business in the ordinary course and not engaging in certain types of transactions during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger. However, the Merger Agreement permits Protective to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends not to exceed $0.10 per share of its common stock. The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including approval of the Merger by Protective\u2019s Class A shareholders, legal and regulatory approvals including from the Indiana Department of Insurance and the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, as well as other customary closing conditions.\nFor additional information regarding the risks associated with the Merger, please see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nVoting and Support Agreement\nOn February 14, 2021, Protective also entered into a Voting and Support Agreement (the \u201cVoting Agreement\u201d) with Progressive and certain of Protective\u2019s shareholders. The Voting Agreement requires that the Protective shareholders party to the Voting Agreement: (i) appear at the meeting of the holders of Protective\u2019s Class A common stock to consider resolutions to approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger or otherwise cause their shares of Protective\u2019s common stock to be counted as present for purposes of calculating a quorum, and (ii) vote their shares (a) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and any action reasonably requested by Progressive or the Board in furtherance of the foregoing, (b) against any action or agreement that would result in a material breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of Protective contained in the Merger Agreement and (c) against any takeover proposal or superior proposal (provided, that if the Board changes its recommendation with respect to the Merger, any shares of Class A common stock owned by such shareholders in excess of approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock will be voted in the same proportion as those shares of Class A common stock voted by the holders of Protective\u2019s Class A common stock that are not party to the Voting Agreement).\nCOVID-19 Impacts\nBeginning in March 2020 and continuing through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the global pandemic associated with COVID-19 and related economic conditions have impacted the global economy and the Company\u2019s results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net premiums earned within the Company\u2019s commercial automobile products, specifically public transportation, were negatively impacted due to a reduction in miles driven, which is the basis for premiums the Company receives, as well as an overall reduction in public transportation units insured. The declines in public transportation persisted throughout the year and have continued into 2021, but we saw a recovery in the third and fourth quarters within our commercial automobile products that has continued through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, losses and loss expenses incurred during the same period reflected favorable impacts within all commercial automobile products as a result of declines in accident frequency due to lower traffic density. In addition to these impacts on the Company\u2019s underwriting loss, as defined below, the Company incurred net realized and unrealized losses on investments of $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to investment losses realized as a result of the significant declines in the global financial markets experienced during the first and second quarters due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, both the Company\u2019s fixed income and equity security investments have recovered to a net gain position. Additionally, insurance departments throughout the country have issued bulletins and regulations urging or requiring insurers to extend grace periods for the payment of policy premiums and to refrain from canceling or non-renewing policies for the non-payment of policy premiums for policyholders adversely affected by COVID-19; however, the Company has not seen a material decrease or slowdown in premium collection to date. Our liquidity and capital resources were not materially impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions during 2020. For further discussion regarding the potential impacts of COVID-19 and related economic conditions on the Company\u2019s results, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" and Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProduct Lines\nCommercial Automobile\nThe Insurance Subsidiaries provide coverage for larger companies in the motor carrier industry that retain substantial amounts of self-insurance, for independent contractors utilized by trucking companies, for medium-sized and small trucking companies on a first-dollar or deductible basis, and for public livery concerns, principally covering fleets of commercial buses. This group of products is collectively referred to as commercial automobile. Large fleet trucking products are marketed both directly to commercial automobile clients and also through relationships with non-affiliated brokers and specialized agents. Products for small and intermediate fleets and independent contractors are marketed through relationships with non-affiliated brokers and specialized agents. In some cases, the Insurance Subsidiaries will provide customized product offerings to specific markets through partnerships with brokers or program administrators. In most cases, the Company's commercial automobile policies are written on an \"occurrence\" basis. This means that the Company may be liable for claims that occurred when its policy was in place with an insured, regardless of when those claims are reported to the Company, and it may take months or even years for claims to be reported to the Company.\nThe principal types of commercial automobile insurance marketed by the Insurance Subsidiaries are:\n\u25cf Commercial motor vehicle liability, physical damage and general liability insurance;\n\u25cf Workers' compensation insurance;\n\u25cf Specialized accident (medical and indemnity) insurance for independent contractors in the trucking industry;\n\u25cf Non-trucking motor vehicle liability insurance for independent contractors;\n\u25cf Fidelity and surety bonds; and\n\u25cf Inland marine insurance consisting principally of cargo insurance.\nThe Insurance Subsidiaries perform a variety of additional services, primarily for the Company's insureds, including risk surveys and analyses, safety program design and monitoring, government compliance assistance, loss control and cost studies and research, development, and consultation in connection with new insurance programs, including development of systems to assist customers in monitoring their accident data. The Company also provides claims handling services, primarily to excess clients with self-insurance programs.\nWorkers' Compensation\nThe Insurance Subsidiaries provide workers' compensation insurance for the commercial automobile industry, primarily to employees of motor carriers or independent contractors providing services in the transportation industry. In 2017, the Company began marketing workers' compensation coverage beyond commercial automobile clients to a variety of non-transportation operations, such as light manufacturing, restaurants, retailers, and professional services on both a first-dollar and deductible basis. In 2019, the Company took actions to reduce exposure to workers\u2019 compensation coverage for non-transportation risks. While the Company has continued to underwrite select non-transportation risks, the Company\u2019s primary focus is underwriting workers\u2019 compensation coverage for transportation risks. In most cases, the Company's workers' compensation policies are written on an \"occurrence\" basis. This means that the Company may be liable for claims that occurred when its policy was in place with an insured, regardless of when those claims are reported to the Company, and it may take months or even years for claims to be reported to the Company.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses incurred on average comprise approximately two-thirds of the Company's operating expenses.\nThe Company's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (\"LAE\") of the Insurance Subsidiaries before the application of reinsurance credits (gross reserves). The liabilities for losses and LAE are determined using case basis evaluations and statistical projections and represent estimates of the Company's ultimate exposure for all unpaid losses and LAE incurred through December 31 of each year. These estimates are subject to the effects of trends in claim severity and frequency and are continually reviewed and, as experience develops and new information becomes known, the liability is adjusted as necessary. Such adjustments, either positive or negative, are reflected in current operations as recorded.\nThe Company's reserves for losses and loss expenses are determined based on evaluations of individual reported claims and by actuarial estimation processes using historical experience, current economic information and, when necessary, available industry statistics. \"Case basis\" loss reserves are evaluated on an individual case-by-case basis by experienced claims adjusters using established Company guidelines and are monitored by claims management. Additionally, \"bulk\" reserves are established for (1) those losses which have occurred but have not yet been reported to the Company (\"incurred but not reported\" claims), (2) provisions for any possible deficiencies in the case reserving process and (3) the expected external and internal costs to fully settle each claim, also referred to as LAE. Common actuarial methods are employed in the establishment of bulk reserves using Company historical loss data, consideration of changes in the Company's business and study of current economic trends affecting ultimate claims costs. LAE reserves include amounts ultimately allocable to individual claims as well as amounts required for the general overhead of the claims handling operation that are not specifically allocable to individual claims. Historical analyses of the ratio of LAE to losses paid on prior closed claims and study of current economic trends affecting loss settlement costs are used to estimate the LAE reserve needs relative to the established loss reserves. Each of these reserve categories contains elements of uncertainty, which assures variability when compared to the ultimate costs to settle the underlying claims for which the reserves are established. For a more detailed discussion of the three categories of reserves, see \"Loss and Loss Expense Reserves\" under the caption, \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBeginning in early 2019, the Company began strategically buying facultative reinsurance on policies with $5.0 million limits, specifically in our excess automobile and public transportation books of business. This reinsurance coverage has served to lower the loss limit on a significant portion of the Company\u2019s commercial automobile liability policies to $2.0 million for a single occurrence. This action, coupled with the renewal of our annual aggregate deductible treaty at a 35% quota share rate, whereby once the aggregate stop-loss level is reached the Company is responsible for its 65% retention, has significantly reduced the Company\u2019s exposure and volatility to large commercial automobile liability losses. In 2020, due to continued rate achievement in commercial automobile, improvements in the Company's mix of business and reductions to the Company's average policy loss limits, the Company decided to non-renew the annual aggregate deductible treaty for policies written on and after July 3, 2020.\nThe Company is a cedent under numerous reinsurance treaties covering its product lines. Treaties are typically written on an annual basis, each with its own renewal date. However, treaty terms may occasionally be agreed to for periods beyond one year. Treaty renewals are expected to largely continue to occur annually in the foreseeable future. Because losses from certain of the Company's products can experience delays in being reported and can take years to settle, losses reported to the Company in the current year may be covered by a number of older reinsurance treaties with higher or lower net loss exposures than those provided by current treaty provisions.\nThe table below sets forth a reconciliation of beginning and ending loss and LAE liability balances for 2020, 2019 and 2018. This table includes reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable, to correspond with the presentation in the Company's consolidated statements of operations, but also includes a reconciliation of beginning and ending loss and LAE liability, gross of reinsurance recoverable, as presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. All amounts are shown net of reinsurance, unless otherwise indicated.\nThe reconciliation above shows the Company's estimate of net losses on 2019 and prior accident years is approximately $0.3 million lower at December 31, 2020 than was provided in loss reserves at December 31, 2019 (referred to as a \"reserve savings\"). This compares to a reserve savings of $0.6 million on prior accident years in 2019 and a $16.8 million reserve deficiency reported in 2018 related to prior accident years.\nThe following table is a summary of the 2020 calendar year reserve savings by accident year (dollars in thousands):\n(1) Consists of development on cases known at December 31, 2019, losses reported which were previously unknown at December 31, 2019 (incurred but not reported), unallocated loss expense paid related to accident years 2019 and prior and changes in the reserves for incurred but not reported losses and loss expenses.\nThe savings shown in accident year 2019 in the table above reflects favorable loss development in short-tail lines of business, such as physical damage and occupational accident. The deficiency shown in accident year 2018 represents deficiencies in the Company's commercial automobile business, specifically excess automobile and public transportation lines of business. The Company took and continues to take action in all accident years to reflect new trends in loss development for commercial automobile products that have emerged over the last several years. These actions include case reserving reviews, as well as continued actuarial product reviews, and resulted in the small reserve strengthening noted in accident years 2018 and prior.\nBulk loss reserves are established to provide for potential future adverse development on cases known to the Company and for cases unknown at the reserve date. Changes in the reserves for incurred but not reported losses and loss expenses occur based upon information received on known and newly reported cases during the current year and the effect of that development on the application of standard actuarial methods used by the Company.\nThe Company continues to incorporate more recent loss development data into its loss reserving formulae; however, the dynamic nature of losses associated with the commercial automobile business, as well as the timing of settlement of large claims, increases the likelihood of variability in loss developments from period to period. While the Company's basic assumptions have remained consistent, the Company continues to update loss data to reflect changing trends, which can be expected to result in fluctuations in loss developments over time.\nManagement's goal is to produce an overall estimate of reserves which is sufficient and as close to expected ultimate losses as possible. The Company constantly monitors changes in trends related to the number of claims incurred relative to correlative variances with premium volume, average settlement amounts, number of claims outstanding at period ends and the average value per claim outstanding and adjusts actuarial assumptions as necessary to accommodate observed trends.\nTen-Year Historical Development Tables:\nThe table below presents the development of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") balance sheet insurance reserves for each year-end from 2010 through 2019, as of December 31, 2020, net of all reinsurance credits.\nANALYSIS OF LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE DEVELOPMENT--GAAP BASIS\n(Dollars in thousands)\n(1) Represents the estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. This liability represents the estimated amount of losses and LAE for claims arising in all prior years that were unpaid at the respective balance sheet date, including incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\") losses, to the Company.\n(2) Represents the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on additional information available to the Company as of the end of each succeeding year. The estimate is increased or decreased as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of individual claims and as claims are settled and paid.\n(3) Represents the aggregate change in the estimates of each calendar year-end reserve through December 31, 2020.\n(4) Represents the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded calendar year-end liability as of the end of each succeeding year. The payment patterns shown in this table demonstrate the \"long-tail\" nature of much of the Company's business, whereby portions of claims, principally in workers' compensation coverages, do not fully pay out for more than ten years.\nReserve developments for all years ended in the period 1985 through 2011 have produced redundancies as of December 31, 2020, with deficiencies developing for periods from 2012 to 2018. The $0.3 million prior accident year savings that developed during 2020 related to favorable loss development in the Company's occupational accident business, partially offset by unfavorable loss development in commercial automobile coverages. The deficiencies that developed in the chart from 2012 through 2018 have been largely attributable to two main factors. First, the Company engaged in new markets between 2008 and 2013, including professional liability and property coverages concentrated in the state of Florida. These products (now discontinued) experienced significant adverse loss development in calendar years 2016 and 2017 as more information emerged and was therefore considered in the reserving process. Second, the Company has experienced increased severity in losses related to its commercial automobile transportation offerings. During 2020, the Company continued to address the rate adequacy and customer segmentation practices of commercial automobile products in response to these adverse loss trends.\nReaders should note the table above does not present accident or policy year development data, which they may be more accustomed to analyzing. Rather, this table is intended to present an evaluation of the Company's ability to establish its liability for losses and loss expenses at a given balance sheet date. In reviewing this information, it is important to understand that this method of presentation causes some development experience to be duplicated. For example, the amount of any redundancy or deficiency related to losses settled in 2012, but incurred in 2009, will be included in the cumulative development amount for each of the years ending December 31, 2010, 2011, and 2012. It is also important to note that conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table.\nThe table below presents loss development data on a gross (before consideration of reinsurance) basis for the same ten-year period December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2019, as of December 31, 2020, with a reconciliation of the data to the net amounts shown in the table above.\nANALYSIS OF LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE DEVELOPMENT--GAAP BASIS\n(Dollars in thousands)\nReaders are reminded the gross data presented above requires significantly more subjectivity in the estimation of IBNR and loss expense reserves because of the high limits provided by the Company to its commercial automobile and workers' compensation customers, some of which has been covered by excess of loss and facultative reinsurance. This is particularly true of excess of loss treaties in which the Company retains risk in only the lower, more predictable, layers of coverage. Accordingly, one would generally expect more variability in development on a gross basis than on a net basis. The Company's consolidated financial statements reflect its financial results net of reinsurance.\nEnvironmental Matters:\nGiven that one of the Company's core businesses is insuring commercial automobile companies, on occasion claims involving a commercial automobile accident which has resulted in the spill of a pollutant are made. Certain of the Company's policies may cover these situations on the basis that they were caused by an accident that resulted in the immediate and isolated spill of a pollutant. These claims are typically reported, evaluated and fully resolved within a short period of time.\nIn general, establishing reserves for environmental claims, other than those associated with \"sudden and accidental\" losses, is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those represented by other types of claims. Factors contributing to those uncertainties include a lack of historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure, unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage, and the extent and timing of any such contractual liability. Courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when the loss occurred and what policies provide coverage, what claims are covered, whether there is an insured obligation to defend, how policy limits are determined, how policy exclusions are applied and interpreted, and whether cleanup costs represent insured property damage.\nVery few environmental claims have historically been reported to the Company. In addition, a review of the businesses of the Company's past and current insureds indicates that exposure to claims of an environmental nature is typically limited because the vast majority of the Company's accounts are not currently, and have not in the past been, involved in the hauling of hazardous substances. Also, the revision of the pollution exclusion in the Company's policies since 1986 limits exposure to such claims.\nThe Company does not expect to have any significant environmental claims relating to asbestos exposure.\nThe Company's reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses at December 31, 2020 did not include significant amounts for liability related to environmental damage claims. The Company does not foresee significant future exposure to environmental damage claims and accordingly has established no reserve for IBNR environmental losses at December 31, 2020.\nMarketing\nHistorically, the Insurance Subsidiaries have primarily focused their commercial automobile marketing efforts on large and medium-sized trucking fleets, with their biggest market share in larger trucking fleets (over 150 power units). The largest of these fleets (over 250 power units) generally self-insure a significant portion of their risk, and self-insured retention plans are a specialty of the Company. The indemnity contract provided to such customers is designed to cover all aspects of commercial automobile liability, including third-party liability, property damage, physical damage and cargo, whether arising from vehicular accident or other casualty loss. The self-insured program is supplemented with large deductible workers' compensation policies in states which do not allow for self-insurance of this coverage. Fleets with fewer than 250 power units typically purchase full insurance coverage or retain deductibles on each claim. In 2020, the Company's commercial automobile offerings also include public livery risks, principally small operators of bus fleets, work-related accident insurance, on a group or individual basis, to independent contractors under contract to a fleet sponsor, as well as workers' compensation coverage to employees of independent contractor fleet owners. Large fleet trucking products are marketed both directly to commercial automobile clients and also through relationships with non-affiliated brokers and specialized independent agents.\nIn addition, the Company offers a program of coverages for \"small fleet\" trucking concerns with generally 5 to 25 power units.\nIn some cases, the Company will provide specific product offerings to specialized markets through partnerships with brokers and program administrators. As the Company has grown, its distribution strategy has moved toward utilization of non-affiliated agents and brokers to place new business for small and intermediate commercial automobile (including independent contractor products). In addition, the Company has developed customized commercial automobile liability and workers' compensation programs, which are marketed through non-affiliated agent partners. These customized programs can include a suite of products selected for its targeted customer base, including commercial automobile liability, general liability, non-trucking liability, cargo, occupational accident, or workers' compensation coverages.\nInvestments\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio has been de-risked over the past three years primarily by reducing the equity and limited partnership investments as a percentage of the overall portfolio and increasing fixed income investments. The Company\u2019s investment strategy emphasizes preservation and growth of capital surplus. Subject to achieving that objective, the Company pursues favorable risk adjusted returns.\nAt December 31, 2020, the market value of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio was approximately $1,043.7 million, consisting of fixed income securities, equity securities, investments in limited partnerships, commercial mortgage loans and short-term and other investments and included $47.0 million of short-term funds classified as cash equivalents.\nA comparison of the allocation of assets within the Company's consolidated investment portfolio, using market value as a basis, is as follows as of December 31:\nFixed Income and Short-Term Investments\nFixed income and short-term securities comprised 92.7% of the market value of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio of $1,043.7 million at December 31, 2020. The fixed income portfolio is widely diversified with no concentrations in any single industry, geographic location or municipality. The largest amount invested in any single issuer was $4.0 million (0.4% of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio). The Company's fixed income portfolio has a short duration compared to the duration of its insurance liabilities and, accordingly, the Company does not actively trade fixed income securities but typically holds such investments until maturity. Exceptions exist in instances where the underlying credit for a specific issue is deemed to be diminished. In such cases, the security will be considered for disposal prior to maturity. In addition, fixed income securities may be sold when realignment of the portfolio is considered beneficial (e.g., moving from taxable to non-taxable issues) or when valuations are considered excessive compared to alternative investments.\nApproximately $63.7 million of the Company's fixed income investments (6.1% of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio, which includes money market instruments classified as cash equivalents) consisted of non-rated bonds and bonds rated as less than investment grade by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\") at year end. These investments had a $2.2 million aggregate net unrealized gain position at December 31, 2020.\nThe market value of the consolidated fixed income portfolio included $26.3 million of net unrealized gains at December 31, 2020 compared to $12.5 million of net unrealized gains at December 31, 2019. The current net unrealized gain on fixed income securities consisted of $4.7 million of gross unrealized losses and $31.0 million of gross unrealized gains at December 31, 2020. The gross unrealized losses equal approximately 0.5% of the cost of all fixed income securities. See also \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding the Company's investment valuation.\nEquity Securities\nBecause of the large amount of high-quality fixed income investments owned, relative to the Company's loss and loss expense reserves (net of reinsurance recoverables) and other liabilities, amounts invested in equity securities are not needed to fund current operations and, accordingly, can be committed for longer periods of time. Equity securities comprised 5.6% of the market value of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio of $1,043.7 million at December 31, 2020. The Company's equity securities portfolio consists of various securities with diversification from large to small capitalization issuers and among several industries. The largest single-equity issue owned had a market value of $3.5 million at December 31, 2020 (0.3% of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio).\nRealized losses related to the sale of equity securities during 2020 recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $8.1 million before taxes. Net unrealized gains on equity securities held at December 31, 2020 included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.9 million.\nAn individual equity security will be disposed of when it is determined that there is little potential for future appreciation or to reallocate from equity to fixed income securities. Securities are disposed of only when market conditions dictate, regardless of the impact, positively or negatively, on current period earnings.\nAs of January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (\"ASU 2016-01\"). The amendments in ASU 2016-01 changed the accounting for non-consolidated equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting by requiring changes in fair value to be recognized in income. Previously, the Company's equity securities were classified as available-for-sale and changes in fair value were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of shareholders' equity.\nDuring 2018, the Company's external investment managers and the Board of Directors' Investment Committee determined that reallocation of the Company's equity portfolio would be beneficial and sold $149.2 million of its equity portfolio, resulting in a gain on sale of $51.9 million. The majority of these gains were included in unrealized gains within other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2017 and, as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-01, were reclassified to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018 and were therefore not recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLimited Partnerships\nThe Company invests in various limited partnerships engaged in long-short equities, private equity, country-focused funds and real estate development as an alternative to direct equity investments. At December 31, 2020, the aggregate carrying value was $7.2 million, comprising 0.7% of the market value of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio.\nAs a group, these investments decreased in value during 2020, with the aggregate of the Company's share of such losses reported by the limited partnerships totaling approximately $1.4 million.\nThe Company follows the equity method of accounting for its limited partnership investments and, accordingly, records the total change in value as a component of net unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities and limited partnership investments. Readers are cautioned that reported increases and decreases in equity value of the Company's limited partnerships can change quickly as a result of volatile market conditions. Limited partnerships also are highly illiquid investments, and the Company's ability to withdraw funds is generally subject to significant restrictions.\nInvestment Yields\nPre-tax net investment income decreased $0.8 million, or 3.2%, during 2020, reflecting lower interest rates earned on cash and cash equivalent balances for the year, partially offset by an increase in average funds invested resulting from positive cash flow from operations, as well as the continued reallocation from equity investments in limited partnerships and cash and cash equivalent investments into short-duration, high-quality bonds. A comparison of consolidated investment yields, before consideration of investment management expenses, is as follows:\nSee also \"Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details of the Company's investment operations.\nRegulatory Framework\nThe Insurance Subsidiaries are currently subject to insurance industry regulation by each of the jurisdictions in which they are licensed. In addition, minor portions of the Insurance Subsidiaries' business are subject to regulation by Bermudian and Canadian federal and provincial authorities. As an insurance holding company, Protective is also subject to oversight from the Indiana Department of Insurance. There can be no assurance that laws and regulations will not be changed by one or more of these regulatory bodies in ways that will require the Company to modify its business models and objectives. In particular, the United States federal government continuously reviews the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, including insurance companies, as well as tax laws and regulation, which could impact the Company's operations and performance.\nAdditionally, changes in laws and regulations governing the insurance industry could have an impact on the Company's ability to generate historical levels of income from its insurance operations. The Company is obligated to comply with numerous complex and varied governmental regulations in order to maintain its authority to write insurance business. While the Company has continuously maintained each of its licenses without exception, failure to maintain compliance could result in governmental regulators temporarily preventing the Company from writing new business, thus having a detrimental effect on the Company. Also, the ability of the Insurance Subsidiaries to modify certain insurance rates, specifically workers' compensation rates, is heavily regulated, and such rate increases are often denied or delayed for substantial periods by regulators.\nInvestments made by the Company's domestic Insurance Subsidiaries are regulated by guidelines promulgated by the NAIC, which are designed to provide protection for both policyholders and shareholders. The statutory capital of each of the Insurance Subsidiaries substantially exceeds the minimum risk-based capital requirements set by the NAIC. State regulatory authorities prescribe calculations of the minimum amount of statutory capital and surplus necessary for each insurance company to remain authorized. These computations are referred to as risk-based capital requirements and are based on a number of complex factors, taking into consideration the quality and nature of assets, the historical adequacy of recorded liabilities and the specific nature of business conducted. At December 31, 2020, the minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements of the Insurance Subsidiaries was $136.5 million. Actual consolidated statutory capital and surplus at December 31, 2020 exceeded this requirement by $210.9 million.\nHuman Capital Management\nProtective is committed to attracting, developing and retaining top talent in order to drive its continued success and achieve its business goals. The Company strives for a diverse and inclusive culture, which rewards performance, provides growth and development opportunities and supports employees through competitive compensation, benefits and numerous volunteer and charitable giving opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately 490 employees working full-time.\nCOVID-19, Employee Safety and Wellness\nEmployee health and safety are top priorities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company adopted numerous health and safety measures in accordance with best-practice safe hygiene guidelines issued by recognized health experts such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as government mandates.\nThe Company has provided for work-from-home arrangements for employees where possible, including providing employees with the necessary equipment to effectively work from home, provides regular communication updates to its employees on COVID-19 related matters, has implemented office sanitization protocols and requires mask usage at the office and temperature and health screening prior to entering the Company's facilities.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nProtective is committed to fostering a work environment that values and promotes diversity and inclusion. During 2020, several Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) were created and staffed by employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences or characteristics who share a common interest in professional development, improving corporate culture and delivering sustained business results. The Company provides equal access to and participation in programs and services without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identify, stereotypes or assumptions based thereon.\nEmployee Engagement, Development and Training\nProtective invests resources in professional development and growth as a means to encourage employee performance, motivation and retention. The Company encourages and supports the growth and development of its employees, and wherever possible, seeks to fill positions by promotion or transfer from within the organization. The Company promotes continuous learning and career development through ongoing performance and development discussions and evaluations, training programs, succession and talent pipeline planning and educational reimbursement programs. The Company provides employees with the opportunity to provide regular feedback through surveys, meetings with management and CEO-led discussions. Employees are also eligible to participate in a departmental rotation program to gain experience and knowledge about the organization.\nOpportunities for continuous learning and development are available to employees through internal and external training resources, conferences and seminars. Protective offers internal online training opportunities on topics such as diversity and inclusion, health and safety, personal development, computer skills and management training courses.\nCompensation and Benefits\nProtective is committed to providing its employees with a competitive compensation package, which rewards performance and achievement of desired business results and personal goal attainment. The Company's compensation package consists of base pay and an incentive program in which all employees are eligible to participate, health and welfare benefits and retirement contributions. The Company analyzes its compensation and benefits programs regularly to ensure they remain competitive with the market.\nHealth and wellness programs are provided and contribute to a productive workforce by empowering our employees to take personal responsibility for their health, safety and well-being. Employees are offered the opportunity to participate in healthcare and insurance benefits, disability insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, parental leave and various wellness programs.\nCommunity Involvement\nThe Company and its employees provide multi-faceted support for its communities to address needs where its employees work and live. Corporate sponsorships and employee volunteer opportunities support a wide range of non-profits, including those that address children and youth programs, education, safety, human trafficking, housing, abuse, joblessness, blood donations and many others.\nRevenue Concentration\nThe Company derives a significant percentage of its direct premium volume from certain FedEx Corporation subsidiaries and operating companies (\"FedEx\"), and from insurance coverage provided to FedEx's contracted service providers. FedEx represented approximately $4.7 million, $4.7 million and $16.2 million of the Company's consolidated gross premiums written in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in 2019 is related to the non-renewal of certain excess coverage policies in late 2018. An additional $207.6 million, $172.8 million and $174.7 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was placed with the Company by a non-affiliated broker on behalf of contracted service providers of FedEx, but this additional business was not dependent upon the Company's direct business with FedEx.\nCompetition\nInsurance underwriting is highly competitive. The Insurance Subsidiaries compete with other stock and mutual companies and inter-insurance exchanges (reciprocals). There are numerous insurance companies offering the lines of insurance which are currently written or may in the future be written by the Insurance Subsidiaries. Many of these companies have been in business for longer periods of time, have significantly larger volumes of business, offer more diversified lines of insurance coverage and have significantly greater financial resources than the Company. In many cases, competitors are willing to provide coverage for rates lower than those charged by the Insurance Subsidiaries. Many potential clients self-insure workers' compensation and other risks for which the Company offers coverage, and some have organized \"captive\" insurance companies as subsidiaries through which they insure their own operations. Some states have workers' compensation funds that preclude private companies from writing this business in those states. Federal law also authorizes the creation of \"Risk Retention Groups,\" which may write insurance coverages similar to those offered by the Company.\nThe Company believes it has a competitive advantage in its major lines of business as the result of its management and staff, its service and products, its willingness to custom build insurance programs for its customers, its centralized location with ready access to skilled employees, its proprietary databases and the use of technology with respect to its insureds. However, should competitors determine to \"buy\" market share with unprofitable rates, the Insurance Subsidiaries will generally experience a decline in business until pricing returns to profitable levels.\nAvailability of Documents\nThe Company is an accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and is required, pursuant to Item 101 of Regulation S-K, to provide certain information regarding its website and the availability of certain documents filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").

    "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following is a description of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Such factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them before deciding to invest in, or retain, shares of our common stock. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nThe impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.\nBeginning in March 2020, the global pandemic related to COVID-19 and related economic conditions began to impact the global economy and our results of operations. A discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business to date can be found in Part I, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the size and breadth of this pandemic, all of the direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 are not yet known and may not emerge for some time. Risks presented by the ongoing effects of COVID-19 include the following:\n\u2022\nNet premiums earned. We experienced an effect on our net premiums earned in the second and third quarters of 2020 primarily due to the reduction in miles driven during that time, which is the basis of premiums we receive, by our commercial automobile insureds, as well as an overall reduction in public transportation units insured. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we saw a partial recovery of premium volume when miles driven increased as a result of increased shipping around the holidays.\n\u2022\nLosses and loss expenses incurred. We saw a favorable impact on our losses and loss expenses incurred in commercial automobile during 2020 as a result of declines in accident frequency due to lower traffic density, but in the future we may incur higher claim and claim adjustment expenses in certain lines of business as a result of COVID-19 due to increases in frequency and/or severity of claims. For example, we may experience elevated frequency and severity in our workers\u2019 compensation lines related to compensable claims by workers who demonstrate that the injury or illness arose both out of and in the course of their employment. We may also experience elevated frequency and severity in our liability coverages as a result of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers seeking to generate COVID-19-related claim activity against our insureds. Additionally, the anticipated and unknown risks related to COVID-19 may cause additional uncertainty in the process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. For example, the behavior of claimants and policyholders may change in unexpected ways, the disruption to the court system may impact the timing and amounts of claims settlements and the actions taken by governmental bodies, both legislative and regulatory, in reaction to COVID-19 and their related impacts are hard to predict. As a result, our estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may change. We are also subject to credit risk in our insurance operations, which may be exacerbated in times of economic distress.\n\u2022\nInvestments. The volatility in the global financial markets related to COVID-19 has contributed to net realized and unrealized investment losses, primarily due to the impact of changes in fair value on our equity investments. Our corporate fixed income portfolio may be adversely impacted by ratings downgrades, increased bankruptcies and credit spread widening in distressed industries, such as energy, gaming, lodging and leisure, autos, airlines and retail. Our money market investments have been impacted by lower interest rates and may continue to be impacted by these lower rates. Our investment portfolio also includes commercial mortgage-backed securities, which could be adversely impacted by declines in real estate valuations and/or financial market disruption. Further volatility in the global financial markets due to the continuing impact of COVID-19 could result in future net realized and unrealized investment losses, including potential impairments in our fixed income portfolio. In addition, further declines in fixed income yields would result in decreases in net investment income from future investment activity, including re-investments.\n\u2022\nLiquidity. Collection of premiums, deductibles or self-insured retentions from our policyholders and reinsurance recoverables from our reinsurers may become increasingly difficult. At the state level, insurance departments throughout the country have issued bulletins and regulations urging or requiring insurers to extend grace periods for the payment of policy premiums and to refrain from canceling or non-renewing policies for the non-payment of policy premiums for policyholders adversely affected by COVID-19. It is uncertain what impact these government mandates may have on our ability to recover unpaid premiums on the affected policies or what our obligations may be for the payment of claims made under policies for which we have not received premium payments.\n\u2022\nAdverse Legislative and/or Regulatory Action. Federal, state and local government actions to address and contain the impact of COVID-19 may adversely affect us. A number of states have instituted, and other states are considering instituting, changes designed to effectively expand workers' compensation coverage by creating presumptions of compensability of claims for certain types of workers. Regulatory restrictions or requirements could also impact pricing, risk selection and our rights and obligations with respect to our policies and insureds, including our ability to cancel policies or our right to collect premiums.\n\u2022\nOperational Disruptions and Heightened Cybersecurity Risks. Our operations could be disrupted if key members of our senior management or a significant percentage of our workforce or the workforce of our agents, brokers, suppliers or outsourcing providers are unable to continue to work because of illness, government directives or otherwise. In addition, the interruption of our or their system capabilities could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions. Having shifted to primarily remote working arrangements, we also face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities. To date, we have not experienced any such operational interruptions or cybersecurity disruptions during this time.\nWe compete with a large number of companies in the insurance industry for underwriting revenues.\nWe compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business. During periods of intense competition for premium, we are vulnerable to the actions of other companies who may seek to write business without what we believe to be an appropriate regard for ultimate profitability. During these times, it is very difficult to grow or maintain premium volume without sacrificing underwriting discipline and income.\nInsurance underwriting is highly competitive. We compete with other stock and mutual companies and inter-insurance exchanges (reciprocals). There are numerous insurance companies offering the lines of insurance which are currently written or may in the future be written by us. Many of these companies have been in business for longer periods of time, have significantly larger volumes of business, offer more diversified lines of insurance coverage and have significantly greater financial resources than us. In many cases, competitors are willing to provide coverage for rates lower than those charged by us. Many potential clients self-insure workers' compensation and other risks for which we offer coverage, and some have organized \"captive\" insurance companies as subsidiaries through which they insure their own operations. Some states have workers' compensation funds that preclude private companies from writing this business in those states. Federal law also authorizes the creation of \"Risk Retention Groups,\" which may write insurance coverages similar to those offered by us.\nWe may incur increased costs in competing for underwriting revenues as we seek to expand our business. Increased costs associated with attracting and writing new clients may negatively impact underwriting revenue. If we are unable to compete effectively, our underwriting revenues may decline, as well as our overall business results.\nNew competition could cause the supply and/or demand for insurance or reinsurance to change, which could affect our ability to price our coverages at attractive rates and thereby adversely affect our underwriting results.\nThe loss of our major sponsor program could severely impact our revenue and earnings potential.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our direct premium volume from insurance coverage provided to FedEx Ground's contracted service providers through a FedEx Ground sponsored program. The loss of this would likely materially adversely impact our revenue and earnings potential.\nTechnological advances, including those specific to the transportation industry, could present us with added competitive risks.\nAn increase in accident prevention technologies and the growth of autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles could reduce the amount of accidents over time and shift the liability from the owner of the vehicle to the manufacturer, which would cause automobile insurance to become a smaller portion of our overall property and casualty insurance book of business. Innovations in telematics and the increase in usage-based information have become more important and will likely change the way premiums are determined in the future. These advances in technology could materially change the way products in the transportation industry are designed, priced and underwritten, and if we fail to adjust to these changes in a timely manner, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe failure of our information technology systems and other operational systems to operate properly or disruptions or breaches of our information systems could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely upon complex and expensive information technology systems and other operational systems and on the integrity and timeliness of our data to run our businesses, service our customers and interact with policyholders, brokers and employers. The pace at which information systems must be upgraded is continually increasing, requiring an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade to current standards. Our success may be impacted if we are not able to develop and expand the effectiveness of existing systems and to continue to enhance information systems that support our operations in a cost-effective manner. Our networking infrastructure and related assets may also be subject to employee errors or other unforeseen activities that could result in the disruption of business processes, network degradation and system downtime. To the extent that such disruptions occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in a possible loss of business.\nIn addition, our daily business operations require us to retain sensitive data such as proprietary business information and data related to customers, claimants and business partners within our network infrastructure. Cybersecurity attacks and intrusion efforts are continuous and evolving. The scope and severity of risks that cyber threats present have increased dramatically, and include, but are not limited to, disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Our information technology and other systems have been, and in the future could be, subject to physical or electronic break-ins; attempts to gain unauthorized access to data from our employees, vendors or third parties; unauthorized tampering; exploitation of weaknesses related to our vendors or other third parties; denials of service; computer viruses and other malicious software; or other cybersecurity attacks or breaches, resulting in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to our customers and business partners, or in the theft of intellectual property or proprietary information. We evaluate the adequacy of our third-party service providers\u2019 cybersecurity measures through periodic due diligence and contractual obligations. Despite these safeguards, disruptions to and breaches of our information technology systems or providers\u2019 are possible and may negatively impact our business.\nWe cannot ensure that we will be able to identify, prevent or contain the effects of any future cyber attacks or other cybersecurity incidents that bypass our security measures or disrupt our information technology systems or business. Any failure to maintain proper security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on our information technology and other operational systems could delay or disrupt our ability to do business and service clients, harm our reputation, require us to incur significant remediation costs, subject us to litigation, regulatory fines, a loss of customers and revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers, experienced underwriters, claims professionals and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our specialty lines of business. If we are unable to attract and retain such individuals, we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialty markets in which we operate and may be unable to achieve our growth strategy.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR PROPOSED MERGER\nWe may not consummate our proposed merger with Progressive within the timeframe or in the manner we anticipate, or at all, which could negatively affect our business and our stock price.\nOn February 14, 2021, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Progressive and Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement provides for, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, the merger of Merger Sub with and into Protective, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Protective shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Progressive.\nConsummation of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including (i) approval by our Class A shareholders of the Merger; (ii) the receipt of required regulatory approvals, including from the Indiana Department of Insurance and the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (iii) the absence of any law, injunction or order preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger; (iv) the accuracy of representations and warranties subject to applicable materiality standards; (v) compliance with all covenants under the Merger Agreement and (vi) the absence of a material adverse effect. There can be no assurance that approval of our Class A shareholders will be obtained, that the other conditions to the consummation of the Merger will be satisfied or waived or that other events or circumstances will not intervene to delay or result in the termination of the Merger. Subject to certain limitations, either party may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger is not consummated by November 14, 2021. If the Merger is not consummated, the price of our common stock may change to the extent that the current market price of our common stock may reflect an assumption that the Merger will be consummated.\nPending the consummation of the Merger, the Merger Agreement also restricts us from engaging in certain actions without Progressive\u2019s consent, which could prevent us from pursuing opportunities that may arise prior to the effective time of the Merger. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, depending on the circumstances giving rise to termination, we may be required to pay a termination fee of approximately $13.3 million.\nOur financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted as a result of the proposed Merger, regardless of whether it is consummated.\nThe Merger may cause disruptions to our business or business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, regardless of whether the Merger is consummated. For example:\n\u2022\nthe attention of our management and our employees may be directed to Merger-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day operations of our business;\n\u2022\nour employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us, which might adversely affect our ability to retain and recruit key employees;\n\u2022\ncustomers, suppliers or other parties with whom we maintain business relationships may experience uncertainty about our future and seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their business relationships with us; and\n\u2022\nlegal proceedings may be instituted against us, our directors and/or our officers with respect to the Merger.\nIn addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, fees and expenses for professional services and other costs related to the Merger Agreement and the Merger, and many of these costs, fees and expenses are payable by us regardless of whether or not the Merger is consummated.\nFINANCIAL AND LIQUIDITY RISKS\nA material decline in our financial strength rating could adversely affect our position in the insurance market and cause a significant reduction in our premiums and earnings.\nOur main insurance subsidiary, Protective Insurance Co., currently has a financial strength rating of \u201cA\u201d (Excellent) with a negative outlook by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (\"A.M. Best\"), which represents a downgrade from the \u201cA+\u201d (Superior) financial strength rating with a negative outlook Protective Insurance Co. had prior to November 20, 2018. In connection with the Merger announcement with Progressive, A.M. Best placed our financial strength rating under review with positive implications on February 16, 2021. Financial ratings are an important factor influencing the competitive position of insurance companies. A.M. Best ratings, which are commonly used in the insurance industry, currently range from \u201cA++\u201d (Superior) to \u201cF\u201d (In Liquidation). The objective of A.M. Best\u2019s rating system is to provide potential policyholders and other interested parties with an expert independent opinion of an insurer\u2019s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations, including paying claims. This rating is subject to periodic review and may be revised downward, upward or revoked at the sole discretion of A.M. Best. A future downgrade by A.M. Best could result in the loss of a number of insurance contracts we write and in a substantial loss of business to other competitors, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to credit risk relating to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.\nWe limit our risk of loss from policies of insurance issued by our Insurance Subsidiaries through the purchase of reinsurance coverage from other insurance companies. Such reinsurance does not relieve us of our responsibility to policyholders should the reinsurers be unable to meet their obligations to us under the terms of the underlying reinsurance agreements. While we have not experienced any significant reinsurance losses for over 25 years, in the past, a small number of our less significant reinsurance carriers have experienced deteriorating financial conditions or have been downgraded by rating agencies, and provisions for potential uncollectible balances from these reinsurers have been established. If we are unable to collect the amounts due to us from reinsurers, any unreserved credit losses could adversely affect our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength rating.\nWe may incur additional losses if our loss reserves are inadequate.\nA large portion of our provision for losses recorded is composed of estimates of future loss payments to be made. Such estimates of future loss payments may prove to be inadequate. Loss and loss expense reserves represent our best estimate at a given point in time but are not an exact calculation of ultimate liability. Rather, they are complex estimates derived by utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency of claims, inflation, claims handling, case reserving policies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant judgment on our part. As trends in underlying claims develop, particularly in so-called \u201clong tail\u201d lines in which the adjudication of claims can take many years and which have seen an increase in claim severity, management is sometimes required to revise reserves. This results in a charge to our earnings in the amount of the adjusted reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate is made. These charges can be substantial and can potentially have a material impact, either positively or negatively, on results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nOur collateral held may prove to be insufficient.\nWe require collateral from our large insureds covering the insureds\u2019 obligations for self-insured retentions or deductibles related to policies of insurance provided. Should we, as surety, become responsible for such insured obligations, the collateral held may prove to be insufficient. In this regard, FedEx utilizes significant self-insured retentions and deductibles under policies of insurance provided by us. In the case of FedEx, we have determined that the financial strength of the customer is sufficient to allow for holding only partial collateral at this time. Should we become responsible for this customer\u2019s entire self-insured retention and deductible obligations, the collateral held would be insufficient, and we would sustain a significant operating loss.\nA material drop in interest rates, or disruption in the fixed income markets, could have an adverse impact on our earnings and, potentially, our financial position.\nGiven our significant interest-bearing investment portfolio, if interest rates materially drop or the fixed income markets are otherwise disrupted, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, which would reduce our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength rating. The functioning of the fixed income markets, the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate them may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted by a change in interest rates or otherwise affected by significant negative factors, including, without limitation: local, national, or international events, such as regulatory changes, wars, or terrorist attacks; a recession, depression, or other adverse developments in either the U.S. or other economies that adversely affects the value of securities held in our portfolio; financial weakness or failure of one or more financial institutions that play a prominent role in securities markets or act as a counterparty for various financial instruments, which could further disrupt the markets; inactive markets for specific kinds of securities, or for the securities of certain issuers or in certain sectors, which could result in decreased valuations and impact our ability to sell a specific security or a group of securities at a reasonable price when desired; a significant change in inflation expectations; or the onset of deflation or stagflation.\nOur investment portfolio is subject to market and credit risks, which could affect our financial results and ability to conduct business.\nWe have a large portfolio of securities and limited partnership investments which can fluctuate in value with a wide variety of market conditions. A decline in the aggregate value of the securities and limited partnership investments would result in a commensurate decline in our shareholders\u2019 equity, either through the income statement or directly to equity. The resultant decline could, at least temporarily, materially adversely affect our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength ratings.\nLEGAL, REGULATORY AND PUBLIC POLICY RISKS\nChanges in laws and regulations governing the insurance industry could have a negative impact on our ability to generate income from our insurance operations.\nOne or more of our Insurance Subsidiaries are regulated and/or licensed in all 50 of the United States, the District of Columbia, all Canadian provinces, Puerto Rico and Bermuda. We are obligated to comply with numerous complex and varied governmental regulations in order to maintain our authority to write insurance business. Failure to maintain compliance could result in governmental regulators preventing us from writing new business, which would have a material adverse impact on us, our results of operations and our financial condition. Further, the ability of our Insurance Subsidiaries to adjust insurance rates and other product offerings is regulated for significant portions of our business, and needed rate adjustments can be denied or delayed for substantial periods by regulators, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.\nWe have two classes of common stock with unequal voting rights that are effectively controlled by our principal shareholders and management, which limits other shareholders\u2019 ability to influence our operations.\nOur principal shareholders, directors and executive officers and their affiliates control approximately 49% of the outstanding shares of voting Class A Common Stock and approximately 25% of the outstanding shares of non-voting Class B Common Stock. These parties effectively control us, direct our affairs, and exert significant influence in the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. The interests of these shareholders may conflict with those of other shareholders, and this concentration of voting power may limit the marketability of our stock and has the potential to delay, defer or prevent a change in control that other shareholders may believe to be in their best interests.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings are unpredictable and could produce one or more unexpected verdicts against us that could materially and adversely affect our financial results for any given period.\nWe are currently, and from time to time have been, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of business. Some of these proceedings may involve matters particular to Protective or one or more of our Insurance Subsidiaries, while others may pertain to business practices in the industry in which we operate. These matters often raise difficult factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities. The outcomes of these matters are difficult to predict, and the amounts or ranges of potential loss at particular stages in the proceedings are in most cases difficult or impossible to ascertain. A further complication is that even where the possibility of an adverse outcome is remote under traditional legal analysis, juries sometimes substitute their subjective views in place of facts and established legal principles. Given the unpredictability of the legal and regulatory landscape in which we operate, there can be no assurance that one or more of these matters will not produce a result that could materially and adversely affect our financial results for any given period.\nFor information about our pending legal proceedings, see Note T, \u201cLitigation, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in current accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially impact our reported financial results.\nDevelopments in accounting practices may require us to incur considerable additional expenses to comply with such developments, particularly if we are required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively. The impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements cannot be predicted but may affect the calculation of net income, net equity and other historical financial statement line items that are important to users of our financial statements. Changes could also introduce significant volatility in our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength rating.",

    "item_5": "Item 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nShares of the Company's Class A and Class B Common Stock are traded on Nasdaq under the symbols PTVCA and PTVCB, respectively. The Class A and Class B common shares have identical rights and privileges, except that Class B shares have no voting rights other than on matters for which Indiana law requires class voting. As of March 8, 2021, there were approximately 28 record holders of Class A Common Stock and approximately 42 record holders of Class B Common Stock.\nThe Company has paid quarterly cash dividends continuously since 1974. The Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share during 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company declared a dividend of $0.10 per share. The Company expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends, although there is no assurance as to future dividends because they are dependent on future earnings, capital requirements and financial conditions and are subject to regulatory restrictions. At December 31, 2020, $136.5 million, or 37.6% of shareholders' equity, represented net assets of the Company's Insurance Subsidiaries which, at that time, could not be transferred in the form of dividends, loans or advances to Protective because of minimum statutory capital requirements. However, management believes that these restrictions do not currently pose any material dividend payment concerns for the Company. The Board intends to address the subject of dividends at each of its future meetings and will consider the Company's earnings, returns on investments and its capital needs.\n(1) Amounts represent shares withheld by the Company in connection with employee payroll tax withholding upon the vesting of stock awards. Stock amounts in the consolidated statements of shareholders\u2019 equity are shown net of these shares withheld.\n(2) On August 31, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the reinstatement of the Company's share repurchase program for up to 2,464,209 shares of its Class A or Class B Common Stock. The repurchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, from time-to-time, and in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. The share repurchase program may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not commit the Company to repurchase any shares of its common stock. The Company has funded, and intends to continue to fund, the share repurchase program from cash on hand. No share repurchases have been made by the Company under the program since March 20, 2020. Additionally, in connection with the Merger Agreement with Progressive, the Company is prohibited from repurchasing any of its Class A or Class B Common Stock under the repurchase program.\nCorporate Performance\nThe following graph shows a five-year comparison of cumulative total return for the Company's Class B Common Stock, the Russell 2000 Index and the Company's peer group as determined by management (the \"PTVCB Peer Group\"). The basis of comparison is a $100 investment at December 31, 2015, in each of (i) Protective, (ii) the Russell 2000 Index and (iii) the PTVCB Peer Group. All dividends are assumed to be reinvested.",

    "item_7": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nProtective Insurance Corporation is a property-casualty insurer specializing in marketing and underwriting property, liability and workers' compensation coverage for trucking and public transportation fleets, as well as coverage for trucking industry independent contractors. We operate as one reportable property and casualty insurance segment, offering a range of products and services, the most significant being commercial automobile and workers' compensation insurance products.\nThe term \u201cProtective,\u201d as used throughout this Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d), refers to Protective Insurance Corporation, the parent company. The terms the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour,\u201d as used throughout this MD&A, refer to Protective and all of its subsidiaries, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. The term \u201cInsurance Subsidiaries,\u201d as used throughout this MD&A, refers to Protective Insurance Company, Protective Specialty Insurance Company, Sagamore Insurance Company and B&L Insurance, Ltd.\nEffective August 1, 2018, we changed our name to Protective Insurance Corporation to better align our holding company's and Insurance Subsidiaries' identities and to reflect our position within the insurance industry.\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, or ASU 2016-01, resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment of $71.0 million ($46.2 million, net of tax). This adjustment moved our historical unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on our equity portfolio from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings, but had no impact on overall shareholders' equity. In addition, for 2018 and forward, the change in fair value for equity securities is required to be recognized in net earnings rather than in other comprehensive income (loss). The impact to our consolidated statements of operations will vary depending upon the level of volatility in the performance of the securities held in our equity portfolio and the overall market.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"U.S. Tax Act\") was signed into law, which lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. We finalized our accounting for the tax effects of the U.S. Tax Act during 2018. No material adjustments to income tax expense (benefit) were recorded during 2018.\nOn September 4, 2020, A.M. Best Company, Inc. (\"A.M. Best\") affirmed our financial strength rating of \"A\" (Excellent). A.M. Best continues to categorize our balance sheet as \"very strong\" and our operating performance as \"adequate,\" but its outlook remains negative. On February 16, 2021, in connection with the announced Merger Agreement discussed below, A.M. Best placed our financial strength rating under review with positive implications.\nSpecial Committee and Contingent Sale Agreement\nOn May 5, 2020, the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) of Protective formed a special committee of independent directors (the \u201cSpecial Committee\u201d) to evaluate a Stockholder Support and Contingent Sale Agreement (the \u201cContingent Sale Agreement\u201d) entered into by and among certain prospective third party purchasers (the \u201cOffering Parties\u201d), certain of Protective\u2019s shareholders and the other parties thereto (The Contingent Sale Agreement was amended and restated on August 17, 2020).\nIn June 2020, Protective announced that the Board determined the transactions contemplated by the Contingent Sale Agreement were not in the best interests of Protective and our stakeholders. As part of this evaluation, the Board determined that it would also recommend against the potential tender offer contemplated by the Contingent Sale Agreement if it were commenced, and that if the transactions contemplated by the Contingent Sale Agreement were consummated, it expects to take the necessary actions to redeem all or certain of the Class A shares of Protective purchased by the Offering Parties pursuant to Protective\u2019s Code of By-laws. Protective also announced that the Special Committee of the Board was exploring, with the assistance of its independent financial and legal advisors, strategic alternatives that may be available to Protective.\nDuring 2020, we incurred an aggregate of $2.9 million ($2.3 million, net of tax) of expenses in conjunction with the Board\u2019s review of the Contingent Sale Agreement and the activities of the Special Committee.\nProposed Merger with The Progressive Corporation\nMerger Agreement\nOn February 14, 2021, Protective entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with The Progressive Corporation, an Ohio corporation (\u201cProgressive\u201d), and Carnation Merger Sub Inc., an Indiana corporation and wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Progressive (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d). The Merger Agreement provides for, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, the merger of Merger Sub with and into Protective (the \u201cMerger\u201d), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease and Protective will continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Progressive.\nThe Board, at the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Protective and its shareholders, and approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The Merger is expected to close prior to the end of the third quarter of 2021. At the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, without par value, of Protective (other than each share of Protective's common stock that is owned by Protective as treasury stock or by any subsidiary of Protective and each share of Protective's common stock owned by Progressive, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Progressive immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive $23.30 in cash, without interest, for a total transaction value of approximately $338 million.\nThe Merger Agreement contains various customary representations and warranties from each of Protective, Progressive and Merger Sub. Protective has also agreed to various customary covenants, including but not limited to conducting its business in the ordinary course and not engaging in certain types of transactions during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger. However, the Merger Agreement permits Protective to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends not to exceed $0.10 per share of its common stock. The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including approval of the Merger by Protective's Class A shareholders, legal and regulatory approvals including from the Indiana Department of Insurance and the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, as well as other customary closing conditions.\nFor additional information regarding the risks associated with the Merger, please see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nVoting and Support Agreement\nOn February 14, 2021, Protective also entered into a Voting and Support Agreement (the \u201cVoting Agreement\u201d) with Progressive and certain of Protective's shareholders. The Voting Agreement requires that the Protective shareholders party to the Voting Agreement: (i) appear at the meeting of the holders of Protective's Class A common stock to consider resolutions to approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger or otherwise cause their shares of Protective's common stock to be counted as present for purposes of calculating a quorum, and (ii) vote their shares (a) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and any action reasonably requested by Progressive or the Board in furtherance of the foregoing, (b) against any action or agreement that would result in a material breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of Protective contained in the Merger Agreement and (c) against any takeover proposal or superior proposal (provided, that if the Board changes its recommendation with respect to the Merger, any shares of Class A common stock owned by such shareholders in excess of approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock will be voted in the same proportion as those shares of Class A common stock voted by the holders of Protective's Class A common stock that are not party to the Voting Agreement).\nExpected Credit Losses Standard (CECL) Adoption\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, or ASU 2016-13. ASU 2016-13 introduced a current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") model for measuring expected credit losses for certain types of financial instruments held at the reporting date requiring significant judgment in application based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts, but is not prescriptive about certain aspects of estimating expected losses. We adopted the guidance using a modified retrospective approach as of January 1, 2020 and recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $15.5 million ($12.3 million net of tax), to the opening balance of retained earnings. The adjustment was primarily related to estimating credit losses on our accounts receivable balances, reinsurance recoverable balances and commercial mortgage loans at the date of adoption with $15.0 million ($11.9 million, net of tax) attributed to our ongoing litigation with Personnel Staffing Group (\"PSG\") discussed in Note T, \"Litigation, Commitments and Contingencies,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the third quarter of 2020, we performed an update to our CECL allowance calculation related to the PSG matter and recorded an additional allowance of $1.5 million ($1.2 million, net of tax). No additional allowance was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. This allowance is included within other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe updated guidance in ASU 2016-13 also amended the previous other-than-temporary impairment (\"OTTI\") model for available-for-sale fixed income securities by requiring the recognition of impairments relating to credit losses through an allowance account and limiting the amount of credit loss to the difference between a security\u2019s amortized cost basis and its fair value. In addition, the length of time a security has been in an unrealized loss position will no longer impact the determination of whether a credit loss exists. We adopted the guidance related to available-for-sale fixed income securities on January 1, 2020 using a prospective transition approach for available-for-sale fixed income securities that were purchased with credit deterioration or had recognized an OTTI write-down prior to the effective date. The effect of the prospective transition approach was to maintain the same amortized cost basis before and after the effective date. For those securities in an unrealized loss position where we intended to sell as of December 31, 2020, we recorded a write down to earnings of $1.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. We also analyzed securities in an unrealized loss position for credit losses and recorded an allowance for credit losses of $1.0 million as of December 31, 2020. We reviewed our remaining fixed income securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2020 and determined the losses were primarily the result of non-credit factors, such as the increase in market volatility due to the disruption in global financial markets as a result of the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic and responses to it. We currently do not intend to sell nor do we expect to be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost.\nCOVID-19 Impacts\nBeginning in March 2020 and continuing through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the global pandemic associated with COVID-19 and related economic conditions have impacted the global economy and our results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net premiums earned within our commercial automobile products, specifically public transportation, were negatively impacted due to a reduction in miles driven, which is the basis for premiums we receive, as well as an overall reduction in public transportation units insured. The declines in public transportation persisted throughout the year and have continued into 2021, but we saw a recovery in the third and fourth quarters within other commercial automobile products that has continued through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, losses and loss expenses incurred during the same period reflected favorable impacts within all commercial automobile products as a result of declines in accident frequency due to lower traffic density. In addition to these impacts on our underwriting loss, as defined below, we incurred net realized and unrealized losses on investments of $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to investment losses realized as a result of the significant declines in the global financial markets experienced during the first and second quarters due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, both our fixed income and equity security investments have recovered to a net gain position. Additionally, insurance departments throughout the country have issued bulletins and regulations urging or requiring insurers to extend grace periods for the payment of policy premiums and to refrain from canceling or non-renewing policies for the non-payment of policy premiums for policyholders adversely affected by COVID-19; however, we have not seen a material decrease or slowdown in premium collection to date. Our liquidity and capital resources were not materially impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions during 2020. For further discussion regarding the potential impacts of COVID-19 and related economic conditions on our results, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe primary sources of our liquidity are (1) funds generated from insurance operations, including net investment income, (2) proceeds from the sale of investments, and (3) proceeds from maturing investments.\nWe generally experience positive cash flows from operations. Premiums are collected on insurance policies in advance of the disbursement of funds for payment of claims. Operating costs of our property/casualty Insurance Subsidiaries, other than loss and loss expense payments and commissions paid to related agency companies, average less than one-third of net premiums earned on a consolidated basis and the remaining amount is available for investment for varying periods of time depending on the type of insurance coverage provided and the timing of the claim payments. Because losses are often settled in periods subsequent to when they are incurred, operating cash flows may, at times, become negative as loss settlements on claim reserves established in prior years exceed current revenues. Our cash flow relating to premiums is significantly affected by reinsurance programs in effect, whereby we cede both premium and risk to other insurance and reinsurance companies. These programs vary significantly among products and certain contracts call for reinsurance payment patterns, which do not coincide with the collection of premiums by us from our insureds.\nOn August 31, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the reinstatement of our share repurchase program for up to 2,464,209 shares of our Class A or Class B Common Stock. The repurchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, from time-to-time, and in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. The share repurchase program may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not commit us to repurchase any shares of our common stock. We have funded, and intend to continue to fund, the share repurchase program from cash on hand. The actual number and value of the shares to be purchased will depend on the performance of our stock price, market volume and other market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid $1.8 million to repurchase 126,764 shares of Class B Common Stock under the share repurchase program. No share repurchases have been made since March 20, 2020. Additionally, in connection with the Merger Agreement with Progressive discussed above, we are prohibited from repurchasing any of our Class A or Class B Common Stock under the share repurchase program.\nFor several years, our investment philosophy has emphasized the purchase of short-term bonds with high quality and liquidity. Our fixed income investment portfolio continues to emphasize shorter-duration instruments. If there was a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points, the price of our fixed income portfolio, including cash, at December 31, 2020 would be expected to fall by approximately 2.8%. The credit quality of our fixed income securities remains high with a weighted average rating of AA-, including cash. The average contractual life of our fixed income and short-term investment portfolio was 7.1 years at December 31, 2020 compared to 6.9 years at December 31, 2019. The average duration of our fixed income portfolio remains shorter than the average duration of our liabilities. We also remain an active participant in the equity securities market. The long-term horizon for our equity investments allows us to invest in positions where ultimate value, and not short-term market fluctuation, is the primary focus. Investments made by our domestic property/casualty Insurance Subsidiaries are regulated by guidelines promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the \"NAIC\"), which are designed to provide protection for both policyholders and shareholders.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $74.9 million during 2020 compared to $86.7 million for 2019. The $11.8 million decrease in operating cash flows during 2020 reflected lower premium volume and lower investment income from our fixed income securities when compared to the same period of 2019. Additionally, net cash from operations in 2019 benefited from the impact of growth in premiums and the timing of related claims payments. Net cash provided by operating activities was $86.7 million for 2019 compared to $100.7 million in 2018. The $14.0 million decrease was primarily related to an increase in payments for losses and loss adjustment expenses and operating expenses, partially offset by higher premium volume as well as higher investment income during 2019.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $86.0 million for 2020 compared to $151.9 million in 2019. The $65.9 million change was primarily due to a $31.3 million decrease in the investment of cash and cash equivalents into fixed income securities, $52.0 million higher proceeds from maturities of fixed income securities and a $30.1 million increase in net proceeds from sales of equity securities, partially offset by $18.8 million less in limited partnership distributions during 2020 compared to 2019. Net cash used in investing activities was $151.9 million for 2019 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $23.7 million in 2018. The $175.6 million change was primarily the result of a decrease in proceeds from sales of our fixed income and equity securities of $229.7 million compared to 2018. We also had higher purchases of fixed income and equity securities of $8.2 million during 2019 compared to 2018. These cash outflows were partially offset by $33.4 million in distributions received from our limited partnership investments in 2019 compared to $6.9 million in 2018 and $20.4 million higher proceeds from maturities of fixed income securities during 2019 compared to 2018. Additionally, during 2018, we purchased $10.0 million of company-owned life insurance, which did not recur in 2019.\nNet cash used in financing activities for 2020 consisted of regular cash dividend payments to shareholders of $5.7 million ($0.40 per share) and $1.8 million to repurchase 126,764 shares of our Class B common stock. Financing activities for 2019 consisted of regular cash dividend payments to shareholders of $5.9 million ($0.40 per share) and $11.5 million to repurchase 677,088 shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. Financing activities for 2018 consisted of regular cash dividend payments to shareholders of $16.8 million ($1.12 per share) and $4.6 million to repurchase 199,668 shares of our Class A and Class B common stock.\nOur assets at December 31, 2020 included $47.0 million of investments included within cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet that are readily convertible to cash without market penalty and an additional $117.0 million of fixed income investments maturing in less than one year. We believe these liquid investments, plus the expected cash flow from premium collections, are sufficient to provide for projected claim payments and operating cost demands. In the event competitive conditions produce inadequate premium rates and we choose to further restrict volume or our premiums are further restricted due to market conditions, including related to the impact of COVID-19, we believe the liquidity of our investment portfolio would permit us to continue to pay claims as settlements are reached without requiring the disposal of investments at a loss, regardless of interest rates in effect at the time.\nWe maintain a revolving credit facility with a $40.0 million limit, with the option for up to an additional $35.0 million in incremental loans at the discretion of the lenders, which has an expiration date of August 9, 2022. Interest on this revolving credit facility is referenced to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") and can be fixed for periods of up to one year at our option. Outstanding drawings on this revolving credit facility were $20.0 million as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the effective interest rate was 1.25% and we had $20.0 million remaining under the revolving credit facility. The current outstanding borrowings were used to repay our previous line of credit. Our revolving credit facility has two financial covenants, each of which were met as of December 31, 2020. These covenants require us to have a minimum U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") net worth and a maximum consolidated debt to equity ratio of 0.35.\nAnnualized net premiums written by our Insurance Subsidiaries for 2020 equaled approximately 126.9% of the combined statutory surplus of these subsidiaries. According to the NAIC, acceptable ranges for the ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus include results of up to 300%. This ratio is designed to measure our ability to absorb above-average losses and our financial strength. Additionally, the statutory capital of each of our Insurance Subsidiaries substantially exceeded minimum risk-based capital requirements set by the NAIC as of December 31, 2020. As a result, we have the ability to increase our business without seeking additional capital to meet regulatory guidelines.\nConsolidated shareholders' equity is composed largely of GAAP shareholders' equity of our Insurance Subsidiaries. As such, there are statutory restrictions on the transfer of substantial portions of this equity to Protective. At December 31, 2020, $50.6 million may be transferred by dividend or loan to Protective without approval by, or prior notification to, regulatory authorities. An additional $151.1 million of shareholders' equity of our Insurance Subsidiaries could be advanced or loaned to Protective with prior notification to, and approval from, regulatory authorities, although transfers of this size would not be practical. We believe these restrictions pose no material liquidity concerns for us. We also believe the financial strength and stability of our Insurance Subsidiaries would permit access by Protective to short-term and long-term sources of credit when needed. Protective had cash and marketable securities valued at $12.9 million at December 31, 2020.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe believe investors\u2019 understanding of our performance is enhanced by our disclosure of underwriting income (loss), which is a measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Underwriting income (loss) represents the pre-tax profitability or loss of our insurance operations and is derived by subtracting net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments and net investment income from income (loss) before federal income tax expense (benefit). For the year ended December 31, 2020, we also excluded corporate charges incurred in conjunction with the Board's review of the Contingent Sale Agreement, activities of the Special Committee as well as the CECL allowance adjustment related to the PSG matter discussed above from the calculation of underwriting income (loss). For the year ended December 31, 2018 we had a goodwill impairment charge, which was excluded from the calculation of 2018 underwriting income (loss). We believe the exclusion of these charges and the CECL allowance adjustment increases the period-to-period comparability of our operational results. We use underwriting income (loss) as an internal performance measure in the management of our operations because we believe it gives us and users of our financial information useful insight into our results of operations, our underlying business performance and our ongoing operating trends. Underwriting income (loss) should not be viewed as a substitute for income (loss) before federal income tax expense (benefit) calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define underwriting income (loss) differently.\nThe ratio of consolidated other operating expenses, less commissions and other income, to net premiums earned, or our expense ratio, and the ratio of losses and loss expenses incurred, plus other operating expenses, less commissions and other income, to net premiums earned, or our combined ratio, are measures of our profitability that we believe increase the period-to-period comparability of our operational results. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we also excluded the corporate charges and CECL allowance adjustment, and for the year ended December 31, 2018, we also excluded the goodwill impairment charge, discussed above from other operating expenses when calculating our expense ratio and our combined ratio, as these ratios are intended to depict our underlying business performance and ongoing operating trends. We believe the exclusion of these charges and the CECL allowance adjustment improves the comparability of our expense and combined ratios with our ratios in prior years. Our management uses these ratios to evaluate performance, allocate resources and forecast future operating periods. While expense ratios and combined ratios are widely used within our industry, our use of such ratios may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nRepresents the corporate charges incurred in conjunction with the Board's review of the Contingent Sale Agreement, activities of the Special Committee and an adjustment to our CECL allowance related to the PSG litigation matter discussed above.\nResults of Operations\n2020 Compared to 2019\nGross premiums written for 2020 decreased $27.4 million (4.8%), while net premiums earned decreased $1.8 million (0.4%), as compared to 2019. The lower net premiums earned in 2020 were primarily the result of declines in premiums within our commercial automobile products, specifically public transportation, as a result of a reduction in miles driven, which is the basis for premiums we receive, as well as an overall reduction in public transportation units insured, both due to the impact of COVID-19. During the second half of the year, we saw a recovery in premiums within certain commercial automobile products due to a return to a more normal level of miles driven, but the declines in public transportation continued. Additionally, we experienced reduced premiums associated with lower retention rates as we continue to take actions to improve profitability, including rate increases and non-renewal of certain risks. These decreases were partially offset by rate increases, growth in existing business lines and new business policies sold mainly in our commercial automobile products. The difference in the percentage change for premiums written compared to earned was reflective of the normal differences in the financial statement recognition of earned premiums compared to written, as well as differences in reinsurance ceding rates on the mix of business in-force.\nPremiums ceded to reinsurers on our insurance business averaged 19.5% of gross premiums written for 2020 compared to 21.3% for 2019. The decrease in premiums ceded was the result of growth in our commercial automobile products, which carry a lower ceded reinsurance percentage when compared to ceding rates on our workers' compensation products, in addition to the non-renewal of the reinsurance treaty, which impacted the second half of 2020, discussed below.\nLosses and loss expenses incurred during 2020 decreased $29.5 million (8.5%) to $319.0 million compared to $348.5 million in 2019, while the loss ratio decreased to 71.6% for 2020 compared to 77.9% for 2019. The loss ratio is calculated as the percentage of losses and loss expenses incurred to net premiums earned. The lower losses and loss expenses and lower loss ratio for 2020 reflected the results of our underwriting actions, including non-renewal of unprofitable business as well as significant rate increases in commercial automobile. Additionally, losses and loss expenses incurred reflected favorable impacts from COVID-19 within all commercial automobile products as a result of declines in accident frequency due to lower traffic density.\nCommercial automobile products covered by our reinsurance treaties from July 3, 2013 through July 2, 2019 are subject to an unlimited aggregate stop-loss provision. Currently each of these treaty years is reserved at or above the attachment level of these treaties. For every $100 of additional loss, we are only responsible for our $25 retention under these reinsurance treaties. Commercial automobile products covered by our reinsurance treaty from July 3, 2019 through July 2, 2020 are also subject to an unlimited aggregate stop-loss provision. Once the aggregate stop-loss level is reached, for every $100 of additional loss, we are responsible for our $65 retention under this reinsurance treaty. This increase in our retention compared to recent years reflects the combination of 1) a decreased need for stop-loss reinsurance protection resulting from a significant decrease in our commercial automobile average policy loss limits, 2) a higher cost for this coverage and 3) our confidence in profitability improvements given the limits reductions and rate increases on our commercial automobile products. In 2020, due to continued rate achievement in commercial automobile, improvements in our mix of business and reductions to our average policy loss limits, we decided to non-renew the annual aggregate deductible treaty for policies written on or after July 3, 2020.\nNet investment income for 2020 decreased 3.2% to $25.4 million compared to $26.2 million for 2019. The decrease reflected lower interest rates earned on cash and cash equivalent balances in 2020, partially offset by an increase in average funds invested resulting from positive cash flow from operations, as well as the continued reallocation from equity investments in limited partnerships and cash and cash equivalent investments into short-duration, high-quality bonds.\nNet realized and unrealized losses on investments of $9.2 million during 2020 were primarily driven by $6.8 million in net realized losses on sales of securities, excluding impairment losses, $2.9 million in impairments and a $1.4 million decrease in the value of our limited partnership investments, partially offset by $1.9 million in unrealized gains on equity securities during the period. Comparative 2019 net realized and unrealized gains on investments of $12.9 million were primarily driven by $9.3 million in unrealized gains on equity securities during the period, net realized gains on sales of securities, excluding impairment losses, of $2.5 million and a $1.6 million increase in the value of our limited partnership investments, partially offset by impairments on our fixed income securities of $0.5 million recognized during the period. Realized investment gains and losses result from decisions regarding overall portfolio realignment as well as the sale of individual securities, including the change in the aggregate value of limited partnerships and, as such, should not be expected to be consistent from period to period.\nOther operating expenses for 2020 increased $5.0 million (3.6%) to $143.4 million compared to $138.5 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to the $2.9 million of corporate charges incurred during 2020 for third party advisors to the Special Committee in connection with their review of the Contingent Sale Agreement as well as other strategic alternatives, as discussed above, and the $1.5 million increase to the CECL allowance related to our ongoing litigation with PSG recorded in the third quarter of 2020, as discussed above. The ratio of consolidated other operating expenses less commissions and other income to net premiums earned (the \"expense ratio\") was 30.6% during 2020, or 29.6% excluding the corporate charges and CECL allowance adjustment discussed above, compared to 28.9% during 2019.\nFederal income tax expense was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective tax rate on consolidated income for 2020 was 29.9% compared to 15.3% during 2019. The difference in the effective federal income tax rate from the normal statutory rate was primarily related to the impact of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets recorded in the current period, in addition to the effects of tax-exempt investment income and the dividends received deduction. In assessing the valuation of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income or availability to carryback the losses to taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We considered several factors when analyzing the need for a valuation allowance, including our current three year cumulative GAAP loss through December 31, 2020, the increase in deferred tax assets due to the adoption of CECL at January 1, 2020 discussed above, the change in unrealized gains and losses and the loss of a high taxable income year from the carryback period. The three year cumulative loss limits our ability to use projected income beyond 2020 in the analysis. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no valuation allowance. However, the application of intra-period tax allocation rules to benefits associated with deferred tax assets resulted in a charge to continuing operations as of December 31, 2020 of $1.3 million in the consolidated statement of operations, offset by a corresponding benefit in shareholders' equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, net income for 2020 was $4.5 million compared to net income of $7.3 million in 2019, a decrease of $2.8 million.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nGross premiums written for 2019 decreased $7.6 million (1.3%) due to the non-renewal of unprofitable business during the year, while net premiums earned increased $14.4 million (3.3%), as compared to 2018. The higher net premiums earned in 2019 were primarily the result of lower premiums ceded when compared to 2018, as discussed below. The difference in the percentage change for premiums written compared to earned was reflective of the normal differences in the financial statement recognition of earned premiums compared to written, as well as differences in reinsurance ceding rates on the mix of business in-force.\nPremiums ceded to reinsurers on our insurance business averaged 21.3% of gross premiums written for 2019 compared to 23.7% for 2018. During 2018, we had reserve strengthening that resulted in ceding an additional $17.3 million in premium from prior treaty years related to the variable premium adjustment provisions in our historical reinsurance treaties. In comparison the 2019 period reflected the ceding of only an additional $1.6 million in commercial automobile premium from prior treaty years related to variable premium adjustment provisions in our historical reinsurance treaties. This was partially offset by higher gross premiums written in workers' compensation coverages, which carry a higher reinsurance ceding rate in 2019 compared to 2018.\nLosses and loss expenses incurred during 2019 increased $2.6 million (0.8%) to $348.5 million compared to $345.9 million in 2018, while the loss ratio decreased to 77.9% for 2019 compared to 79.9% for 2018. The loss ratio is calculated as the percentage of losses and loss expenses incurred to net premiums earned. The increased losses and loss expenses incurred reflected an increase in current accident year losses driven by continued emergence of severity. This current accident year development was partially offset by prior accident year net savings of $0.6 million that developed during 2019, primarily due to favorable loss development in workers' compensation coverages. Including the impact of the additional $1.6 million of ceded premium discussed above, total prior accident years had an unfavorable impact of $1.0 million in 2019. Losses and loss expenses for 2018 reflected reserve adjustments of $16.8 million related to unfavorable prior accident year loss development in commercial automobile coverages. Including the impact of the additional $17.3 million of ceded premium discussed above, total prior accident years had an unfavorable impact of $34.1 million in 2018.\nCommercial automobile products covered by our reinsurance treaties from July 2013 through June 2019 are subject to an unlimited aggregate stop-loss provision. Currently each of these treaty years is reserved at or above the attachment level of these treaties. For every $100 of additional loss, we are only responsible for our $25 retention. The following table illustrates the benefit of these reinsurance treaties based on select theoretical scenarios. For these theoretical scenarios, the net financial loss to the Company is approximately 25% of the gross loss.\nCommercial automobile products covered by our reinsurance treaty from July 2019 through June 2020 are also subject to an unlimited aggregate stop-loss provision. Once the aggregate stop-loss level is reached, for every $100 of additional loss, we are responsible for our $65 retention. This increase in our retention compared to recent years, reflects the combination of 1) a decreased need for stop loss reinsurance protection resulting from a significant decrease in our commercial automobile subject limits profile, 2) a higher cost for this cover and 3) our confidence in profitability improvements given the limits reductions and rate increases on our commercial automobile products.\nNet investment income for 2019 increased 19.1% to $26.2 million compared to $22.0 million for 2018. The increase reflected an increase in average funds invested resulting from positive cash flow, as well as a reallocation from equity investments held in limited partnerships into short-duration, high-quality bonds.\nNet realized and unrealized gain on investments of $12.9 million during 2019 were primarily driven by $9.3 million in unrealized gains on equity securities during the period, net realized gains on sales of securities, excluding impairment losses, of $2.5 million and a $1.6 million increase in the value of our limited partnership investments, partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments on our fixed income securities of $0.5 million recognized during the period. Comparative 2018 net realized and unrealized losses on investments of $25.7 million were driven by $9.7 million in unrealized losses on equity securities during the period, a $9.3 million decrease in the value of our limited partnership investments and net realized losses on sales of fixed income and equity securities of $6.6 million. Realized investment gains and losses result from decisions regarding overall portfolio realignment as well as the sale of individual securities, including the change in the aggregate value of limited partnerships and, as such, should not be expected to be consistent from period to period.\nOther operating expenses for 2019 increased $1.3 million (0.9%), to $138.5 million compared to 2018. The increase was driven primarily by higher commission expenses as a result of premium written mix and higher salary and benefit expenses during 2019, partially offset by a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $3.2 million recorded in 2018, which did not recur in 2019. The expense ratio was 28.9% during 2019, compared to 28.7% for 2018.\nFederal income tax expense was $1.3 million for 2019 compared to a federal income tax benefit of $9.8 million in 2018. The effective tax rate for 2019 was 15.3% compared to 22.3% in 2018. The effective federal income tax rate in 2019 differed from the normal statutory rate primarily as a result of tax-exempt investment income and the dividends received deduction.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, net income for 2019 was $7.3 million compared to net loss of $34.1 million in 2018, a change of $41.4 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's significant accounting policies that are material and/or subject to significant degrees of judgment are highlighted below.\nInvestment Valuation\nAll marketable securities are included in the Company's balance sheets at current fair market value.\nApproximately 62% of the Company's assets are composed of investments at December 31, 2020. Approximately 93% of these investments are publicly-traded, owned directly and have readily-ascertainable market values. The remaining 7% of investments are composed primarily of mortgage loans and minority interests in several limited partnerships. These mortgage loans are originated and serviced by a third party of which the Company shares, on a pro-rata basis, in all related cash flows of the underlying mortgage loans. These limited partnerships are engaged in long-short equities, private equity, country-focused funds and real estate development as an alternative to direct equity investments. These partnerships do not have readily-determinable market values themselves. Rather, the values recorded are those provided to the Company by the respective partnerships based on the underlying assets of the limited partnerships. While a substantial portion of the underlying assets are publicly-traded securities, those which are not publicly-traded have been valued by the respective limited partnerships using their experience and judgment.\nUnder Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") guidance, if a fixed income security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the decline in value is recorded within impairment losses on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. The new cost basis of the investment is the previously amortized cost basis less the impairment recognized. The new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value. For a fixed income security that the Company does not intend to sell or in cases where it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell the security, the Company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit loss component within net realized gains (losses) on investments, excluding impairment losses in the consolidated statements of operations. The impairment related to all other factors (non-credit factors) is reported in other comprehensive income (loss). The allowance is adjusted for any additional credit losses and subsequent recoveries. Upon recognizing a credit loss, the cost basis is not adjusted.\nThe Company considers the extent to which fair value is below amortized cost in determining whether a credit-related loss exists. The Company also considers the credit quality rating of the security, focusing on those below investment grade, with emphasis on securities downgraded below investment grade. The credit loss is determined by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed income security. The net present value is calculated by discounting the Company's best estimate of projected future cash flows at the appropriate effective interest rate. Additionally, the Company may conclude that a qualitative analysis is sufficient to support its conclusion that the present value of the expected cash flows equals or exceeds a security\u2019s amortized cost.\nEquity securities are recorded at fair value, with unrealized net gains or losses reflected as a component of net unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities and limited partnership investments within the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains and losses on disposals of equity securities are recorded on the trade date and included in net realized gains (losses) on investments, excluding impairment losses.\nThe Company reports investment income due and accrued separately from available-for-sale fixed income securities and has elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for investment income due and accrued. Investment income due and accrued is written off through net realized gains (losses) on investments, excluding impairment losses at the time the issuer defaults or is expected to default on payments.\nReinsurance Recoverable\nReinsurance ceded transactions were as follows for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):\nA discussion of the Company's reinsurance strategies is presented in Part I, Item 1, \"Business,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAmounts recoverable under the terms of reinsurance contracts comprised approximately 26% of total Company assets as of December 31, 2020. In order to be able to provide the high limits required by the Company's insureds, the Company shares a significant amount of the insurance risk of the underlying contracts with various insurance entities through the use of reinsurance contracts. Some reinsurance contracts provide that a loss will be shared among the Company and its reinsurers on a predetermined pro-rata basis (\"quota share\"), while other contracts provide that the Company will keep a fixed amount of the loss, similar to a deductible, with reinsurers taking all losses above this fixed amount (\"excess of loss\"). Some risks are covered by a combination of quota share and excess of loss contracts. The computation of amounts due from reinsurers is based upon the terms of the various contracts and follows the underlying estimation process for loss and loss expense reserves, as described below. Accordingly, the uncertainties inherent in the loss and loss expense reserving process also affect the amounts recorded as recoverable from reinsurers. Estimation uncertainties are greatest for claims which have occurred but which have not yet been reported to the Company. Further, the high limits provided by certain of the Company's insurance policies for commercial automobile liability, workers' compensation and professional liability risks provide more variability in the estimation process than lines of business with lower coverage limits.\nIt should be noted, however, that a change in the estimate of amounts due from reinsurers on unpaid claims will not, in itself, result in charges or credits to losses incurred. This is because any change in estimated recovery follows the estimate of the underlying loss. Thus, it is the computation of the gross underlying loss that is critical.\nAs with any receivable, credit risk exists in the recoverability of reinsurance. This may be even more pronounced than in normal receivable situations since recoverable amounts are not generally due until the loss is settled which, in some cases, may be many years after the contract was written. If a reinsurer is unable, in the future, to meet its financial commitments under the terms of the contracts, the Company would be responsible to satisfy the reinsurer's portion of the loss. The financial condition of each of the Company's reinsurers is vetted upon the execution of a given treaty, and only reinsurers with superior credit ratings are utilized. However, as noted above, reinsurers are often not called upon to satisfy their obligations for several years and changes in credit worthiness can occur in the interim period. Reviews of the current financial strength of each reinsurer are made frequently and, should impairment in the ability of a reinsurer be determined to exist, current year operations would be charged in amounts sufficient to provide for the Company's additional liability. Such charges are included in other operating expenses, rather than losses and loss expenses incurred, since the inability of the Company to collect from reinsurers is a credit loss rather than a deficiency associated with the loss reserving process.\nLoss and Loss Expense Reserves\nThe Company's reserves for losses and loss expenses (\"reserves\") are determined based on complex estimation processes using historical experience, current economic information and available industry statistics. The Company's claims range from routine \"fender benders\" to the highly complex and costly third-party bodily injury claims involving large tractor-trailer rigs. Reserving for each class of claims requires a set of assumptions based upon historical experience, knowledge of current industry trends and seasoned judgment. The high limits provided in many of the Company's policies provide for greater volatility in the reserving process for more serious claims. Court rulings, legislative actions and trends in jury awards also play a significant role in the estimation process of larger claims. The Company continuously reviews and evaluates loss developments subsequent to each measurement date and adjusts its reserve estimation assumptions, as necessary, in an effort to achieve the best possible estimate of the ultimate remaining loss costs at any point in time. Changes to previously established loss and loss expense reserve amounts are charged or credited to losses and loss expenses incurred in the accounting periods in which they are determined. See Note C, \"Loss and Loss Expense Reserves,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information relating to loss and loss expense reserve development.\nThe Company's methods for determining loss and loss expense reserves are essentially identical for interim and annual reporting periods.\nA detailed analysis and discussion for each of the above basic reserve categories follows:\nReserves for known losses (Case reserves)\nEach known claim, regardless of complexity, is handled by a claims adjuster experienced with claims of a similar nature, and a \"case\" reserve appropriate for the individual loss occurrence is established. For routine \"short-tail\" claims, such as physical damage, the Company records an initial reserve that is based upon historical loss settlements adjusted for current trends. As information regarding the loss occurrence is gathered in the claim handling process, the initial reserve is adjusted to reflect the anticipated ultimate cost to settle the claim. For more complex claims, which can tend toward being \"long-tail\" in nature, an experienced claims adjuster will review the facts and circumstances surrounding the loss occurrence to make a determination of the reserve to be established. Many of the more complex claims involve litigation and necessitate an evaluation of potential jury awards, in addition to the factual information, to determine the value of each claim. Each claim is frequently monitored and the recorded reserve is increased or decreased relative to information gathered during the settlement life cycle.\nReserves for incurred but not reported losses\nThe Company uses both standard actuarial techniques common to most insurance companies as well as proprietary techniques developed by the Company in connection with its specialty business products. For its short-tail lines of business, the Company uses predominantly the incurred or paid loss development factor methods. The Company has found that the use of accident quarter loss development triangles, rather than those based upon accident year, are most responsive to claim settlement trends and fluctuations in premium exposure for its short-tail lines. A minimum of 12 running accident quarters is used to project the reserve necessary for incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\") losses for its short-tail lines.\nThe Company also uses the loss development factor approach for its long-tail lines of business. A minimum of 15 accident years is included in the loss development triangles used to calculate link ratios and the selected loss development factors used to determine the reserves for IBNR losses. A minimum of 20 accident years is used for long-tail workers' compensation reserve projections. Significant emphasis is placed on the use of tail factors for the Company's long-tail lines of business.\nFor the Company's commercial automobile risks, which are covered by regularly changing reinsurance agreements and which contain wide-ranging self-insured retentions (\"SIR\"), traditional actuarial methods are supplemented by other methods, as described below, in consideration of the Company's exposures to loss. In situations where the Company's reinsurance structure, the insured's SIR selections, policy volume, and other factors are changing, current accident period loss exposures may not be homogenous enough with historical loss data to allow for reliable projection of future developed losses. Therefore, the Company supplements the above-described actuarial methods with loss ratio reserving techniques developed from the Company's proprietary databases to arrive at the reserve for IBNR losses for the calendar/accident period under review. As losses for a given calendar/accident period develop with the passage of time, management evaluates such development on a monthly and quarterly basis and adjusts reserve factors, as necessary, to reflect current judgment with regard to the anticipated ultimate incurred losses. This process continues until all losses are settled for each period subject to this method.\nReserves for loss adjustment expenses\nWhile certain of the Company's products involve case basis reserving for allocated loss adjustment expenses, the majority of such reserves are determined on a bulk basis. The Company uses historical analysis of the ratios of allocated loss adjustment expenses paid to losses paid on closed claims to arrive at the expected ultimate incurred loss adjustment expense factors applicable to each affected product. Once developed, the factors are applied to the expected ultimate incurred losses, including IBNR, on all open claims. The resulting ultimate incurred allocated loss adjustment expense is then reduced by amounts paid to date on all open claims to arrive at the reserve for allocated loss adjustment expenses to be incurred in the future for the handling of specific claims.\nFor those loss adjustment expenses not specific to individual claims (general claims handling expenses referred to as unallocated loss adjustment expenses), the Company uses a variation of the standard industry loss adjustment expenses paid to losses paid (net of reinsurance) ratio analysis that equally weighs paid and incurred losses to establish the necessary reserves. The selected factors are applied to 100% of IBNR reserves and to case reserves, with consideration given for that portion of loss adjustment expense already paid at the reserve measurement date. Such factors are monitored and revised, as necessary, on a quarterly basis.\nSensitivity Analysis - Potential impact on reserve volatility from changes in key assumptions\nManagement is aware of the potential for variation from the reserves established at any particular point in time. Savings or deficiencies could develop in future valuations of the currently established loss and loss expense reserve estimates under a variety of reasonably possible scenarios. The Company's reserve selections are developed to be a \"best estimate\" of unpaid losses at a point in time and, due to the unique nature of its exposures, particularly in the large commercial automobile excess product, ranges of reserve estimates are not established during the reserving process. However, basic assumptions that could potentially impact future volatility of the Company's valuations of current loss and loss expense reserve estimates include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf Consistency in the individual case reserving processes;\n\u25cf The selection of loss development factors in the establishment of bulk reserves for incurred but not reported losses and loss expenses;\n\u25cf Projected future loss trend; and\n\u25cf Expected loss ratios for the current book of business, particularly the Company's commercial automobile products, where the number of accounts insured, selected SIRs, policy limits and reinsurance structures may vary widely from period to period.\nUnder reasonably possible scenarios, it is conceivable that the Company's selected loss estimates could be 10% or more redundant or deficient. The majority of the Company's reserves for losses and loss expenses, on a net of reinsurance basis, relate to its commercial automobile products. Perhaps the most significant example of sensitivity to variation in the key assumptions is the loss ratio selection for the Company's commercial automobile products for policies subject to certain major reinsurance treaties. The following table presents the approximate impacts on gross and net loss reserves of both a hypothetical 10 percentage point and a hypothetical 20 percentage point increase or decrease in the loss factors actually utilized in the Company's reserve determination at December 31, 2020 for the prior seven treaty periods, which covers exposures earned on policies written between July 3, 2014 and December 31, 2020. The Company's selection of the range of values presented should not be construed as the Company's prediction of future events, but rather simply an illustration of the impact of such events, should they occur.\nThe variation in impact from loss ratio increases and decreases is attributable to minimum and maximum premium rate factors included in the various reinsurance contracts. In between the minimum and maximum ceded premium provisions within the treaty terms, net premiums earned can be increased or decreased based on a change in loss expectation. The total impact to profitability in the same scenarios is shown below ($ in millions):\nFederal Income Tax Considerations\nThe liability method is used in accounting for federal income taxes. Using this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The provision for deferred federal income tax is based on items of income and expense that are reported in different years in the consolidated financial statements and tax returns and are measured at the tax rate in effect in the year the difference originated.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Act was signed into law. The U.S. Tax Act lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. GAAP requires the impact of tax legislation to be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted. The Company finalized its accounting for the tax effects of the U.S. Tax Act during 2018. No material adjustments to income tax expense (benefit) were recorded in 2018.\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities) reported at December 31 are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nDeferred tax assets at December 31, 2020 included approximately $12.9 million related to the timing of deductibility of loss and loss expense reserves, the majority of which relate to policy liability discounts required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which are perpetual in nature and, in the absence of the termination of the Company's business, will not, in the aggregate, reverse to a material degree in the foreseeable future. The allowance for CECL under ASU 2016-13 represents $3.6 million of deferred tax assets, while unearned premiums discount and deferred ceding commissions represent $2.3 million and $0.5 million of deferred tax assets, respectively. An additional $2.0 million relates to timing differences in the expensing of our stock compensation plans. The balance of deferred tax assets consists of various normal operating expense accruals and is not considered to be material. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no valuation allowance. However, the application of intra-period tax allocation rules to benefits associated with deferred tax assets resulted in a charge to continuing operations as of December 31, 2020 of $1.3 million within the consolidated statement of operations, offset by a corresponding benefit in shareholders' equity within accumulated other comprehensive income.\nFASB provides guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions and prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Based on this guidance, management regularly analyzes tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based on the threshold condition prescribed. Tax positions that do not meet or exceed this threshold condition are considered uncertain tax positions. Interest related to uncertain tax positions, if any, would be recognized in income tax expense. Penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions would be recorded in income tax expense (benefit).\nImpact of Inflation\nTo the extent possible, the Company attempts to recover the impact of inflation on loss costs and operating expenses by increasing the premiums it charges. Within the commercial automobile business, a majority of the Company's accounts are charged as a percentage of an insured's gross revenue, mileage or payroll. As these charging bases increase with inflation, premium revenues are immediately increased. The remaining premium rates charged are adjustable only at periodic intervals and often require state regulatory approval. Such periodic increases in premium rates may lag far behind cost increases.\nTo the extent inflation influences yields on investments, the Company is also affected. The Company's short-term and fixed investment portfolios are structured in direct response to available interest rates over the yield curve. As available market interest rates fluctuate in response to the presence or absence of inflation, the yields on the Company's investments are impacted. Further, as inflation affects current market rates of return, previously committed investments might increase or decline in value depending on the type and maturity of the investment. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInflation must also be considered by the Company in the creation and review of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, as portions of these reserves are expected to be paid over extended periods of time. The anticipated effect of inflation is implicitly considered when estimating liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses.\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below sets forth the amounts of the Company's contractual obligations at December 31, 2020.\nThe Company's loss and loss expense reserves do not have contractual maturity dates, and the exact timing of the payment of claims cannot be predicted with certainty. However, based upon historical payment patterns, the above table presents an estimate of when the Company might expect its direct loss and loss expense reserves (without the benefit of reinsurance recoveries) to be paid. Timing of the collection of the related reinsurance recoverable, estimated to be $455.6 million at December 31, 2020, or 42% of the loss and loss expense reserves presented in the above table, would approximate that of the above projected direct reserve payout but could lag behind such payments by several months in some instances.\nThe investment commitment in the above table relates to a maximum unfunded capital obligation for a limited partnership investment at December 31, 2020. The actual call dates for such funding could vary from that presented.\nBorrowings made under the Company's line of credit can be called by the lender, under certain circumstances, with short notice. The Company entered into a line of credit on August 9, 2018 with an expiration date of August 9, 2022.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company operates within the property and casualty insurance industry and, accordingly, has significant invested assets that are exposed to various market risks. These market risks relate to interest rate fluctuations, credit risks, equity security market prices and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency rate fluctuations. All of the Company's invested assets, with the exception of investments in limited partnerships and equity securities, are classified as available-for-sale.\nBased on the structure of the Company's investment portfolio, one of the most significant of the four identified market risks relates to prices in the equity securities markets. Although not the largest category of the Company's invested assets, equity securities and limited partnerships, which are predominately invested in equities, have a high potential for short-term price fluctuation. The market value of the Company's equity and limited partnerships positions at December 31, 2020 was $65.4 million, or approximately:\n\u25cf 6% of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio of $1,043.7 million; and\n\u25cf 18% of the Company's shareholders' equity of $363.1 million.\nFunds invested in the equities markets are not considered to be assets necessary for the Company to conduct its daily operations and, therefore, can be committed for extended periods of time. The long-term nature of the Company's equity investments allows it to invest in positions where ultimate value, and not short-term market fluctuations, is the primary focus.\nReference is made to the discussion of limited partnership investments in \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All of the market risks attendant to equity securities also apply to the underlying assets in these limited partnerships, and to a greater degree because of the generally more aggressive investment philosophies utilized by the limited partnerships. In addition, these investments are illiquid. There is no primary or secondary market on which these limited partnerships trade and, in most cases, the Company is prohibited from disposing of its limited partnership interests for some period of time and must seek approval from the general partner for any such disposal. Distributions of earnings from these limited partnerships are largely at the sole discretion of the general partners, and distributions are generally not received by the Company for many years after the earnings have been reported. Finally, through the application of the equity method of accounting, the Company's share of net income reported by the limited partnerships often includes significant amounts of unrealized appreciation on the underlying investments.\nThe Company's fixed income portfolio totaled $919.7 million at December 31, 2020. Approximately 28% of this portfolio is made up of U.S. Government and municipal debt securities, and the average contractual maturity of the Company's fixed income investments is approximately 7.1 years with an average modified duration of approximately 2.8 years. Although the Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its fixed income investments, given the anticipated duration of the Company's liabilities (principally insurance loss and loss expense reserves) relative to investment maturities, even a 100 to 200 basis point increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the Company's ability to conduct daily operations or to meet its obligations and would, in fact, result in higher investment income in a relatively short period of time, as short-term investments and maturing bonds could be reinvested in the higher yielding securities.\nThere is an inverse relationship between interest rate fluctuations and the fair value of the Company's fixed income investments. Additionally, the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the financial strength of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, liquidity of the investment, currency fluctuations for non-U.S. debt holdings and other general market conditions. The Company monitors its sensitivity to interest rate risk by measuring the change in fair value of its fixed income investments relative to hypothetical changes in interest rates.\nThe following tables present the estimated effects on the fair value of financial instruments at December 31, 2020 and 2019 that would result from an instantaneous change in yield rates of varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on current fair value. The analysis presents the sensitivity of the fair value of the Company's financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. The range of rates chosen reflects the Company's view of changes that the Company believes are reasonably possible over a one-year period. The Company's selection of the range of values chosen to represent changes in interest rates should not be construed as the Company's prediction of future market events, but rather, as an illustration of the impact of such events, should they occur. The equity portfolio was compared to the S&P 500 Index due to its correlation with the vast majority of the Company's current equity portfolio. The limited partnership portfolio was compared to the S&P 500 Index and the S&P BSE 500 Index due to their significant correlation with the vast majority of the Company's limited partnership portfolio. As previously indicated, several other factors can impact the fair values of fixed income investments and, therefore, significant variations in market interest rates could produce quite different results from the hypothetical estimates presented below.\nThe following tables present the estimated effects on the fair value of financial instruments at December 31, 2020 and 2019 due to an instantaneous increase in yield rates of 100 basis points and a 10% decline in the S&P 500 Index and the S&P BSE 500 Index (dollars in thousands).\nThe following tables present the estimated effects on the fair value of financial instruments at December 31, 2020 and 2019 due to an instantaneous increase in yield rates of 150 basis points and a 15% decline in the S&P 500 Index and the S&P BSE 500 Index (dollars in thousands).\nANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K",
    "item_8": "ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020\nPROTECTIVE INSURANCE CORPORATION\nCARMEL, INDIANA\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Protective Insurance Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Protective Insurance Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 11, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nAdoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13\nAs discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for the recognition and measurement of expected credit losses for certain types of financial instruments in 2020 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. See below for a discussion of our related critical audit matter for the Personnel Staffing Group recoverable allowance.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) related to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of Incurred but Not Reported Loss and Loss Expense Reserves\nDescription of the Matter\nAs of December 31, 2020, the liability for incurred but not reported loss and loss expense reserves, net of reinsurance (\u201cIBNR\u201d), represented a significant portion of the loss and loss expense reserve, net of reinsurance. As discussed in Note A and Note C to the consolidated financial statements, the carrying amount of the loss and loss expense reserve, net of reinsurance, is management\u2019s best estimate of the ultimate liability for indemnity costs and related adjustment expense necessary to investigate and settle claims and is based upon individual case estimates for reported claims and actuarial estimates for IBNR. The estimate for IBNR is determined based on evaluations of individual reported claims and by actuarial estimation processes considering historical experience, relevant economic information, and available industry statistics. The IBNR estimate is driven by management\u2019s expected loss ratio assumption, which is comprised of various factors, including historical payment patterns and expected future trends in claim severity and frequency.\nAuditing management\u2019s best estimate of IBNR was complex and required the involvement of our actuarial specialists due to the significant measurement uncertainty associated with the estimation and high degree of subjectivity in management\u2019s determination of the expected loss ratio assumption. Management\u2019s expected loss ratio assumption has a significant effect on the valuation of IBNR.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the process for estimating IBNR. These audit procedures included, among others, testing management\u2019s review and approval controls over the expected loss ratio assumption for estimating IBNR.\nWith the assistance of actuarial specialists, our audit procedures included, among others, an evaluation of the Company\u2019s expected loss ratio assumption, which included a comparison of historical payment patterns, expected future trends in claim severity and frequency, and consideration of relevant economic information and other industry factors to our prior year analysis and actual current year loss activity. To evaluate the expected loss ratio assumption, we developed an independent range of reasonable reserve estimates that we compared to management\u2019s best estimate of IBNR. We also analyzed year-to-year movements within our independently developed range. Additionally, we performed a review of the development of prior years\u2019 reserve estimates.\nPersonnel Staffing Group Recoverable Allowance\nDescription of the Matter\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company has a recoverable due from a single customer, Personnel Staffing Group, for $47.3 million related to claims that have been paid or will be paid on behalf of Personnel Staffing Group by the Company for which the Company has recorded a $16.5 million credit impairment allowance. As discussed above and in Note A and Note T to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance amount is management\u2019s best estimate of the ultimate credit impairment for the recoverable based on the expected timing and amount of cash flows from Personnel Staffing Group. This estimate is particularly sensitive to the default and recovery in default assumptions which have a significant impact on the allowance. These assumptions involve significant uncertainty and management judgment.\nAuditing management\u2019s best estimate of the Personnel Staffing Group recoverable allowance (the allowance) required the involvement of our valuation specialists due to the significant measurement uncertainty associated with management\u2019s estimation. The uncertainty is primarily driven by the high degree of subjectivity in management\u2019s determination of the default and recovery in default assumptions.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the process for estimating the allowance. These audit procedures included, among others, testing management review and approval controls over the assumptions for estimating the allowance.\nWith the assistance of our valuation specialists, our audit procedures included, among others, reviewing contract terms between Personnel Staffing Group and the Company, reading minutes of the meetings of the committees of the board of directors, reading summaries of the lawsuits with Personnel Staffing Group, reviewing legal letters pertinent to the matter, reviewing historical bankruptcy data from similar entities within the industry, and evaluating the Company\u2019s selection of methods used to estimate the allowance compared with those methods used in the industry for similar types of analyses. To evaluate the significant assumptions used by management, we compared the significant assumptions to industry data for entities with similar characteristics to Personnel Staffing Group and financial data specific to Personnel Staffing Group. With the assistance of the valuation specialists, we developed an independent range of reasonable allowance estimates that we compared to management\u2019s best estimate.\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1970.\n/s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP\nIndianapolis, Indiana\nMarch 11, 2021\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nProtective Insurance Corporation and Subsidiaries\n(in thousands, except share data)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nProtective Insurance Corporation and Subsidiaries\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nProtective Insurance Corporation and Subsidiaries\n(in thousands)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity\nProtective Insurance Corporation and Subsidiaries\n(in thousands)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nProtective Insurance Corporation and Subsidiaries\n(in thousands)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nProtective Insurance Corporation and Subsidiaries\n(All dollars amounts presented in these notes are in thousands, except share and per share data)\nNote A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business: Protective Insurance Corporation (the \"Company\"), based in Carmel, Indiana, is a property-casualty insurer specializing in marketing and underwriting property, liability and workers' compensation coverage for trucking and public transportation fleets, as well as coverage for trucking industry independent contractors. The Company offers a range of products and services, the most significant being commercial automobile and workers' compensation insurance products. The Company operates as one reportable property and casualty insurance segment based on how its operating results are regularly reviewed by its chief operating decision maker when making decisions about how resources are allocated and assessing performance.\nThe term \u201cInsurance Subsidiaries,\u201d as used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, refers to Protective Insurance Company, Protective Specialty Insurance Company, Sagamore Insurance Company and B&L Insurance, Ltd.\nEffective August 1, 2018, the Company changed its name to Protective Insurance Corporation to better align its holding company's and Insurance Subsidiaries' identities and to reflect its position within the insurance industry.\nBasis of Presentation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates: Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results will differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents: The Company considers investments in money market funds to be cash equivalents. Carrying amounts for these instruments approximate their fair values.\nInvestments: Carrying amounts for fixed income securities represent fair value and are based on quoted market prices, where available, or broker/dealer quotes for specific securities where quoted market prices are not available. Equity securities are carried at quoted market prices (fair value).\nCommercial mortgage loans are carried primarily at amortized cost along with an allowance for losses when necessary. These investments represent interests in commercial mortgage loans originated and serviced by a third party of which the Company shares, on a pro-rata basis, in all related cash flows of the underlying mortgage loans. The Company recorded an allowance of $195 on its commercial mortgage loans as of December 31, 2020 in conjunction with the adoption of the credit losses accounting standard discussed below.\nThe Company accounts for investments in limited partnerships using the equity method of accounting, which requires an investor in a limited partnership to record its proportionate share of the limited partnership's net income. To the extent the limited partnerships include both realized and unrealized investment gains or losses in the determination of net income or loss, then the Company would also recognize, through its consolidated statements of operations, its proportionate share of the investee's unrealized, as well as realized, investment gains or losses within net unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities and limited partnership investments.\nShort-term and other investments are carried at cost, which approximates their fair values.\nFixed income securities are considered to be available-for-sale. The related unrealized net gains or losses (net of applicable tax effects) on fixed income securities are reflected directly in other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity. Included within available-for-sale fixed income securities are convertible debt securities. A portion of the changes in the fair values of convertible debt securities is reflected as a component of net realized gains (losses) on investments, excluding impairment losses within the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains and losses on disposals of fixed income securities are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses on fixed income securities are determined by the specific identification of the cost of investments sold and are included in net realized gains (losses) on investments, excluding impairment losses.\nEquity securities are recorded at fair value, with unrealized net gains or losses reflected as a component of net unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities and limited partnership investments within the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains and losses on disposals of equity securities are recorded on the trade date and included in net realized gains (losses) on investments, excluding impairment losses.\nInvestment Impairments: For a fixed income security in an unrealized loss position where the Company has the intent to sell the fixed income security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the fixed income security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the decline in value is recorded within impairment losses on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. The new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the impairment recognized. The new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value.\nFor a fixed income security that the Company does not intend to sell or in cases where it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell the security, the Company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit loss component within net realized gains (losses) on investments, excluding impairment losses in the consolidated statements of operations. The impairment related to all other factors (non-credit factors) is reported in other comprehensive income (loss). The allowance is adjusted for any additional credit losses and subsequent recoveries. Upon recognizing a credit loss, the cost basis is not adjusted.\nThe Company considers the extent to which fair value is below amortized cost in determining whether a credit-related loss exists. The Company also considers the credit quality rating of the security, focusing on those below investment grade, with emphasis on securities downgraded below investment grade. The credit loss is determined by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed income security. The net present value is calculated by discounting the Company's best estimate of projected future cash flows at the appropriate effective interest rate. Additionally, the Company may conclude that a qualitative analysis is sufficient to support its conclusion that the present value of the expected cash flows equals or exceeds a security\u2019s amortized cost.\nThe Company reports investment income due and accrued separately from available-for-sale fixed income securities and has elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for investment income due and accrued. Investment income due and accrued is written off through net realized gains (losses) on investments, excluding impairment losses at the time the issuer defaults or is expected to default on payments.\nDeductible Receivables: Under certain workers\u2019 compensation insurance contracts with deductible features, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant for the full amount of the claim. The Company is subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. These amounts are included on a net of allowance basis in the consolidated balance sheets within accounts receivable. The allowance is based upon the Company\u2019s ongoing review of amounts outstanding, changes in policyholder credit standing, and other relevant factors. A probability-of-default methodology, which reflects current and forecasted economic conditions, is used to estimate the allowance for expected credit losses for uncollateralized deductible receivables. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an allowance for expected credit losses of $16,500 ($13,035, net of tax). See Note T - Litigation, Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion.\nProperty and Equipment: Property and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets: In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company concluded the entire goodwill balance was impaired, resulting in an impairment loss of $3,152. See Note M for further discussion. This impairment charge is included within other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. Intangible assets determined to have finite lives, such as customer relationships and employment agreements, are amortized over their estimated useful lives in a manner that best reflects the economic benefits of the intangible asset. In addition, impairment testing is performed on these amortizing intangible assets if impairment indicators are noted..\nReserves for Losses and Loss Expenses: The reserves for losses and loss expenses are determined using case basis evaluations and statistical analyses and represent estimates of the ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses which are unpaid at year-end. These reserves include estimates of future trends in claim severity and frequency and other factors which could vary as the losses are ultimately settled. While actual results will differ from such estimates, management believes that the reserves for losses and loss expenses are adequate. The estimates are continually reviewed, and as adjustments to these reserves become necessary, such adjustments are reflected in current operations.\nRecognition of Revenue and Costs: Premiums are earned over the period for which insurance protection is provided. A reserve for unearned premiums is established to reflect amounts applicable to subsequent accounting periods. Commissions to unaffiliated companies and premium taxes applicable to unearned premiums are deferred and expensed as the related premiums are earned. The Company does not defer acquisition costs that are not directly variable with the production of premiums. If it is determined that expected losses and deferred expenses will likely exceed the related unearned premiums, the asset representing deferred policy acquisition costs is reduced and an expense is charged against current operations to reflect any such premium deficiency. In the event that the expected premium deficiency exceeds deferred policy acquisition costs, an additional liability would be recorded with a corresponding expense to current operations for the amount of the excess premium deficiency. Anticipated investment income is considered in determining recoverability of deferred acquisition costs. The Company had no material contract assets, contract liabilities, or deferred contract costs recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020.\nReinsurance: Reinsurance premiums, commissions, expense reimbursements and reserves related to the Company's reinsured business are accounted for on bases consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts. Premiums ceded to other insurers have been reported as a reduction of premiums earned. Amounts applicable to reinsurance ceded for unearned premiums and claim loss reserves have been reported as reinsurance recoverable assets. Certain reinsurance contracts provide for additional or return premiums and commissions based upon profits or losses to the reinsurer over prescribed periods. Estimates of additional or return premiums and commissions are adjusted quarterly to recognize actual loss experience to date, as well as projected loss experience applicable to the various contract periods. Estimates of reinstatement premiums on reinsurance contracts covering catastrophic events are, to the extent reasonably determinable, recorded concurrently with the related loss.\nShould impairment in the ability of a reinsurer to satisfy its obligations to the Company be determined to exist, current year operations would be charged in amounts sufficient to provide for the Company's additional liability. Such charges, when incurred, are included in other operating expenses, rather than losses and loss expenses incurred, because the inability of the Company to collect from reinsurers is a credit risk rather than a deficiency associated with the loss reserving process.\nDeferred Taxes: Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws. The deferred tax benefits of the deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Deferred income tax expense or benefit generally represents the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year. Current income tax expense represents the tax liability associated with revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported.\nRestricted Stock: Shares of restricted stock vest over the vesting period from the date of grant and certain shares of restricted stock are accelerated for retirement-eligible recipients in accordance with the non-substantive, post-grant date vesting clause of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 715, Compensation-Retirement Benefits. Restricted stock is valued based on the closing price of the Company's Class B Common Stock on the day the award is granted.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share: Diluted earnings (loss) per share of common stock are based on the average number of shares of Class A and Class B Common Stock outstanding during the year, adjusted for the dilutive effect, if any, of restricted stock awards outstanding. Basic earnings (loss) per share are presented exclusive of the effect of share-based awards outstanding.\nComprehensive Income (Loss): The Company records accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and from foreign exchange adjustments as a separate component of shareholders' equity. A reclassification adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss) is made for gains or losses during the period included in net income (loss).\nFair Value Measurements: The Company provides disclosures related to recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements with separate disclosures for the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, along with an explanation for the transfers. Additionally, separate disclosures are provided for purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis for Level 3 fair value measurements as well as additional clarification for both the level of disaggregation reported for each class of assets or liabilities and disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements for assets and liabilities categorized as Level 2 or Level 3.\nInsurance Company-Owned Life Insurance: Included within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $11,458 and $11,049 of company-owned life insurance. The carrying value of the company-owned life insurance policies represents the cash surrender value as reported by the respective insurer, which approximates fair value.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, or ASU 2016-01. The amendments in ASU 2016-01 changed the accounting for non-consolidated equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting by requiring changes in fair value to be recognized in income. Previously, the Company's equity securities were classified as available-for-sale and changes in fair value were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of shareholders' equity. The Company adopted ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to reclassify unrealized gains on equity securities of $71,012 ($46,157, net of tax) from other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings within the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. Unrealized gains or losses on equity securities are now recognized in the consolidated statements of operations within net unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities and limited partnership investments.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), or ASU 2016-02. ASU 2016-02 superseded the prior lease guidance in ASC Topic 840, Leases. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis. Concurrently, lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The guidance provided for a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative periods presented in the financial statements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, or ASU 2018-11, which provided adopters an additional transition method by allowing entities to initially apply ASU 2016-02, and subsequent related standards, at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. The Company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2019 utilizing the transition method allowed per ASU 2018-11, and accordingly, comparative period financial information was not adjusted for the effects of the new guidance. No cumulative-effect adjustment was required to the opening balance of retained earnings on the adoption date. The Company's adoption of the new standard did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated statements of operations or cash flows. As of December 31, 2020 the Company had a right-of-use asset and a lease liability recorded within the consolidated balance sheet, each of approximately $120, which are included within other assets and accounts payable and other liabilities.\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-09, Codification Improvements. This update provided clarification, corrected errors in and made minor improvements to various ASC topics. Many of the amendments in this update had transition guidance with effective dates for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and some amendments in this update did not require transition guidance and were effective upon issuance of this update. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, or ASU 2016-13. ASU 2016-13 introduced a current expected credit loss (CECL) model for measuring expected credit losses for certain types of financial instruments held at the reporting date requiring significant judgment in application based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts, but is not prescriptive about certain aspects of estimating expected losses. The guidance replaced the current incurred loss model for measuring expected credit losses and provided for additional disclosure requirements. Subsequently, the FASB issued additional ASUs on Topic 326 that did not change the core principle of the guidance in ASU 2016-13, but provided clarification and implementation guidance on certain aspects of ASU 2016-13, and have the same effective date and transition requirements as ASU 2016-13. The Company adopted the guidance using a modified retrospective approach as of January 1, 2020 and recognized an pre-tax cumulative effect adjustment of $15,545 ($12,281, net of tax), to the opening balance of retained earnings. The adjustment was primarily related to estimating credit losses on the Company\u2019s accounts receivable balances, reinsurance recoverable balances and commercial mortgage loans at the date of adoption with $15,000 ($11,850, net of tax) attributed to the ongoing litigation with Personnel Staffing Group (\"PSG\") discussed in Note T - Litigation, Commitments and Contingencies.\nThe updated guidance in ASU 2016-13 also amended the previous other-than-temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) model for available-for-sale fixed income securities by requiring the recognition of impairments relating to credit losses through an allowance account and limits the amount of credit loss to the difference between a security\u2019s amortized cost basis and its fair value. In addition, the length of time a security has been in an unrealized loss position will no longer impact the determination of whether a credit loss exists. The Company adopted the guidance related to available-for-sale fixed income securities on January 1, 2020 using a prospective transition approach for available-for-sale fixed income securities that were purchased with credit deterioration or had recognized an OTTI write-down prior to the effective date. The effect of the prospective transition approach was to maintain the same amortized cost basis before and after the effective date.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, or ASU 2018-13. This update removed the disclosure requirements for the amounts of and the reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and disclosure of the policy for timing of transfers between levels. This update also removed disclosure requirements for the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally, this update added disclosure requirements for the changes in unrealized gains and losses for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements and quantitative information for certain unobservable inputs in Level 3 fair value measurements. The Company adopted ASU 2018-13 as of January 1, 2020. As the requirements of this guidance are applicable to disclosure only, the adoption of ASU 2018-13 had no material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, or ASU 2019-12. Among other items, the amendments in ASU 2019-12 simplify the accounting treatment of tax law changes and year-to-date losses in interim periods. An entity generally recognizes the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment; however, there is an exception for tax laws with delayed effective dates. Under current guidance, an entity may not adjust its annual effective tax rate for a tax law change until the period in which the law is effective. This exception was removed under ASU 2019-12, thereby providing that all effects of a tax law change are recognized in the period of enactment, including adjustment of the estimated annual effective tax rate. Regarding year-to-date losses in interim periods, an entity is required to estimate its annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year at the end of each interim period and use that rate to calculate its income taxes on a year-to-date basis. However, current guidance provides an exception that when a loss in an interim period exceeds the anticipated loss for the year, the income tax benefit is limited to the amount that would be recognized if the year-to-date loss were the anticipated loss for the full year. ASU 2019-12 removes this exception and provides that in this situation, an entity would compute its income tax benefit at each interim period based on its estimated annual effective tax rate. ASU 2019-12 became effective on January 1, 2021 and is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nNote B - Investments\nThe following is a summary of available-for-sale securities at December 31:\nThe following table summarizes, for available-for-sale fixed income securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the aggregate fair value and gross unrealized loss categorized by the duration individual securities have been continuously in an unrealized loss position.\nThe fair value and the cost or amortized costs of fixed income investments at December 31, 2020, organized by contractual maturity, are shown below. Actual maturities may ultimately differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have, in some cases, the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Pre-refunded municipal bonds are classified based on their pre-refunded call dates.\nMajor categories of investment income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are summarized as follows:\nFollowing is a summary of the components of net realized and unrealized gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n(1) During 2018, the Company sold $149,195 in equity securities, resulting in a gain on sale of $51,900. The majority of these gains were included in unrealized gains within other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2017 and, as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-01, were reclassified to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018 and were therefore not recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAs discussed in Note A, the Company adopted the provisions of the new CECL model for measuring expected credit losses for available-for-sale fixed income securities as of January 1, 2020. The updated guidance amended the previous OTTI model for available-for-sale fixed income securities by requiring the recognition of impairments relating to credit losses through an allowance account on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to earnings and limiting the amount of credit loss to the difference between a security\u2019s amortized cost basis and its fair value. For those securities in an unrealized loss position throughout the year where the Company intended to sell the security at the balance sheet date, a write down to earnings of $1,826 was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company also analyzed securities in an unrealized loss position for credit losses and recorded an allowance for credit losses of $1,035 as of December 31, 2020. The Company reviewed its remaining fixed income securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2020 and determined the losses were the result of non-credit factors, such as the increase in market volatility due to the disruption in global financial markets as a result of the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic and responses to it. The Company currently does not intend to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost.\nGain and loss activity for fixed income securities, as shown in the previous table, includes adjustments for impairment losses on investments for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 summarized as follows:\nThere is no primary market and only a limited secondary market for the Company's investments in limited partnerships and, in most cases, the Company is prohibited from disposing of its limited partnership interests for some period of time and generally must seek approval from the applicable general partner for any such disposal. Distributions of earnings from these partnerships are largely at the sole discretion of the general partners, and distributions are generally not received by the Company for many years after the earnings have been reported. The Company has a commitment to contribute up to an additional $350 to a limited partnership as of December 31, 2020.\nThe fair value of regulatory deposits with various insurance departments in the United States and Canada totaled $122,896 and $99,763 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nShort-term investments at December 31, 2020 included $1,000 in certificates of deposit issued by a Bermuda bank.\nThe Company's fixed income securities are over 93% invested in investment grade fixed income investments. The Company has no fixed income investments that were originally issued with guarantees by a third-party insurance company nor does the Company have any direct exposure to any guarantor at December 31, 2020.\nApproximately $63,660 of fixed income investments (6.1% of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio, which includes money market instruments classified as cash equivalents) consists of non-rated bonds and bonds rated as less than investment grade at year-end. These investments have a $2,230 aggregate net unrealized gain position at December 31, 2020.\nNote C - Loss and Loss Expense Reserves\nActivity in the reserves for losses and loss expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is summarized as follows. All amounts are shown net of reinsurance, unless otherwise indicated.\nThe table above shows that a reserve savings of $311 developed during 2020 in the settlement of claims occurring on or before December 31, 2019, compared to a reserve savings of $550 in 2019 and reserve deficiencies of $16,786 in 2018. The developments for each year are composed of individual claim savings and deficiencies which, in the aggregate, have resulted from the settlement of claims at amounts higher or lower than previously reserved and from changes in estimates of losses incurred but not reported as part of the normal reserving process.\nThe following table reconciles the triangles presented in this note to the total (savings) / deficiency for the Company of $311 shown in the table above:\nThe $311 prior accident year savings that developed during 2020 related to favorable loss development in the Company's occupational accident business, partially offset by unfavorable loss development in commercial automobile coverages. This 2020 savings compares to savings of $550 for 2019 related to favorable loss development in the Company's workers' compensation business, and a deficiency of $16,786 for 2018 related to unfavorable development from commercial automobile coverages. This unfavorable loss development was the result of increased claim severity due to a more challenging litigation environment, as well as an unexpected increase in the time to settle claims leading to an unfavorable change in claim settlement patterns.\nLoss reserves have been reduced by estimated salvage and subrogation recoverable of approximately $4,000 and $4,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following is information about incurred and paid claims development as of December 31, 2020, net of reinsurance, as well as cumulative claim frequency and the total of incurred-but-not-reported liabilities plus expected development on reported claims included within the net incurred claims amounts.\nWorkers' Compensation\nCommercial Liability\nProfessional Liability Reinsurance Assumed (in runoff)\nOccupational Accident\nPhysical Damage (1)\n(1) The majority of physical damage claims settle within a two-year period. The triangles above have been abbreviated to reflect the short-tail nature of this business.\nThe reconciliation of the net incurred and paid claims development tables to the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows.\nThe following is supplementary information about average historical claims duration as of December 31, 2020:\nReserve methodologies for incurred but not reported losses\nThe Company uses both standard actuarial techniques common to most insurance companies as well as proprietary techniques developed by the Company in connection with its specialty business products. For its short-tail lines of business, the Company uses predominantly the incurred or paid loss development factor methods. The Company has found that the use of accident quarter loss development triangles, rather than those based upon accident year, are most responsive to claim settlement trends and fluctuations in premium exposure for its short-tail lines. A minimum of 12 running accident quarters is used to project the reserve necessary for incurred but not reported losses for its short-tail lines.\nThe Company also uses the loss development factor approach for its long-tail lines of business, including workers' compensation. A minimum of 15 accident years is included in the loss development triangles used to calculate link ratios and the selected loss development factors used to determine the reserves for incurred but not reported losses. Significant emphasis is placed on the use of tail factors for the Company's long-tail lines of business.\nFor the Company's commercial automobile risks, which are covered by regularly updated reinsurance agreements and which contain wide-ranging self-insured retentions (\"SIR\"), traditional actuarial methods are supplemented by other methods, as described below, in consideration of the Company's exposures to loss. In situations where the Company's reinsurance structure, the insured's SIR selections, policy volume, and other factors are changing, current accident period loss exposures may not be homogenous enough with historical loss data to allow for reliable projection of future developed losses. Therefore, the Company supplements the above-described actuarial methods with loss ratio reserving techniques developed from the Company's proprietary databases to arrive at the reserve for incurred but not reported losses for the calendar/accident period under review. As losses for a given calendar/accident period develop with the passage of time, management evaluates such development on a monthly and quarterly basis and adjusts reserve factors, as necessary, to reflect current judgment with regard to the anticipated ultimate incurred losses. This process continues until all losses are settled for each period subject to this method. The Company notes there is more inherent uncertainty in 2020 than normal due to COVID-19, which could lead to either favorable or unfavorable impacts to its loss development that are currently unknown.\nClaim count methodology\nThe Company uses a claim event and coverage combination to estimate frequency. For example, a single claim event involving loss for physical damage of a vehicle and personal injury to a claimant would be considered two claims for purposes of the calculation of frequency. A single claim event causing personal injury to two claimants would be considered a single claim under the methodology. Due to the number of reinsurance assumed treaties entered into (and the varying structures: both quota share and excess of loss) the Company deems it impractical to collect claim frequency information related to this business and this information has not been made available to the Company.\nNote D - Reinsurance\nThe Insurance Subsidiaries cede portions of their gross premiums written to certain other insurers under excess of loss and quota share treaties and by facultative placements. Some reinsurance contracts provide that a loss be shared among the Company and its reinsurers on a predetermined pro-rata basis (\"quota share\"), while other contracts provide that the Company keep a fixed amount of the loss, similar to a deductible, with reinsurers taking all losses above this fixed amount (\"excess of loss\"). Reinsurance treaties with other companies permit the recovery of a portion of related direct losses. Management determines the amount of net exposure it is willing to accept generally on a product-line basis. Certain treaties covering commercial automobile risks include annual deductibles which must be exceeded before the Company can recover under the terms of the treaty. The Company retains a higher percentage of the direct premium in consideration of these deductible provisions. The Company remains liable to the extent the reinsuring companies are unable to meet their obligations under reinsurance contracts.\nThe Company also serves as an assuming reinsurer on treaties with direct writing insurance companies and, prior to June 30, 2015, under retrocessions from other reinsurers for catastrophic property coverages. Accordingly, for periods prior to that date, the occurrence of catastrophic events could have had a significant impact on the Company's operations. In addition, the Insurance Subsidiaries participate in certain mandatory residual market pools, which require insurance companies to provide coverages on assigned risks. The assigned risk pools allocate participation to all insurers based upon each insurer's portion of premium writings on a state or national level. Historically, the operation of these assigned risk pools has resulted in net losses being allocated to the Company, although such losses have not been material in relation to the Company's operations.\nThe following table summarizes the impact of reinsurance ceded and assumed on the Company's net premiums written and earned for the most recent three years:\nNet losses and loss expenses incurred for 2020, 2019 and 2018 have been reduced by ceded reinsurance recoveries of approximately $105,895, $121,927 and $148,173, respectively. Ceded reinsurance premiums and loss recoveries for the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance coverage on the Company's net direct business were not material.\nNet losses and loss expenses incurred include expenses of $432 for 2020, expenses of $193 for 2019 and a savings of $1,300 for 2018, relating to reinsurance assumed from non-affiliated insurance or reinsurance companies.\nComponents of reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nNote E - Income Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"U.S. Tax Act\") was signed into law, which lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The Company finalized its accounting for the tax effects of the U.S. Tax Act during 2018. No material adjustments to income tax expense (benefit) were recorded during 2018.\nDeferred income taxes are calculated to account for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nA summary of the difference between federal income tax expense (benefit) computed at the statutory rate and that reported in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:\nFederal income tax expense (benefit) as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 consists of the following:\nThe provision for deferred federal income taxes as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 consists of the following:\nIn assessing the valuation of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income or availability to carryback the losses to taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company considered several factors when analyzing the need for a valuation allowance, including the Company's current three year cumulative GAAP loss through December 31, 2020, the increase in deferred tax assets due to the adoption of CECL at January 1, 2020 discussed in Note A, the change in unrealized gains and losses and the loss of a high taxable income year from the carryback period. The three year cumulative loss limits the Company's ability to use projected income beyond 2020 in the analysis. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no valuation allowance. However, the application of intra-period tax allocation rules to benefits associated with deferred tax assets resulted in a charge to continuing operations as of December 31, 2020 of $1,264 in the consolidated statement of operations, offset by a corresponding benefit in shareholders' equity within accumulated other comprehensive income.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020, as amended (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), was signed into law on March 27, 2020, to provide national emergency economic relief measures. The CARES Act, among other things, permits net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryovers and carrybacks to offset 100% of taxable income for taxable years beginning before 2021. In addition, the CARES Act allows NOLs incurred in 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. The Company has evaluated the impact of the CARES Act, noting it does not have a material impact.\nThe Company has no uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020 or 2019. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense (benefit) and changes in such accruals would impact the Company's effective tax rate. There were no amounts accrued for the payment of interest at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2020, calendar years 2019, 2018 and 2017 remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.\nNote F - Shareholders' Equity\nThe Company's Class A and Class B Common Stock has a stated value of approximately $0.04 per share. The Company paid a total of $5,692, or $0.40 per share, in dividends during 2020, $5,857, or $0.40 per share, during 2019 and $16,835, or $1.12 per share, during 2018.\nOn August 31, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the reinstatement of its share repurchase program for up to 2,464,209 shares of the Company's Class A or Class B Common Stock. No duration has been placed on the Company's share repurchase program, and the Company reserves the right to amend, suspend or discontinue it at any time. The share repurchase program does not commit the Company to repurchase any shares of its common stock.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company paid $1,782 to repurchase 126,764 shares of Class B Common Stock at an average share price of $14.07 under the share repurchase program. No share repurchases have been made by the Company since March 20, 2020.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nA reconciliation of the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\n(1) Includes the $1,264 valuation allowance benefit recorded in other comprehensive income. See Note E - Income Taxes for additional information.\nDetails of changes in net unrealized gains (losses) on investments for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\n(1) Includes the $1,264 valuation allowance benefit recorded in other comprehensive income. See Note E - Income Taxes for additional information.\nNote G - Other Operating Expenses\nDetails of other operating expenses for the years ended December 31:\nNote H - Employee Benefit Plans\nThe Company maintains a defined contribution 401(k) Employee Savings and Profit Sharing Plan (the \"Plan\") which covers nearly all employees. The Company's contributions are based on a set percentage and the contributions to the Plan for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $3,274, $3,213 and $3,486, respectively.\nNote I - Stock Based Compensation\nThe Company issues shares of restricted Class B Common Stock to the Company's outside directors as part of their annual retainer compensation. The shares are distributed to the outside directors on the vesting date, which, with the exception of pro-rated annual retainers granted to outside directors, is one year following the date of grant. On May 17, 2019, the Company granted shares of restricted Class B Common Stock in connection with the election of a new outside director, reflecting such director\u2019s pro-rated annual retainer compensation, which shares vested and were distributed on May 7, 2020. Additionally, effective May 22, 2019, John D. Nichols, Jr. ceased serving as the Company's Interim Chief Executive Officer and principal executive officer, but continued to serve as Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors. On May 22, 2019, the Company granted shares of restricted Class B Common Stock to Mr. Nichols in connection with this transition, reflecting his pro-rated annual retainer compensation, which shares also vested and were distributed on May 7, 2020. The table below provides details of the restricted stock issuances to directors for 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nCompensation expense related to the above stock grants is recognized over the period in which the directors render the services.\nDirector compensation expense associated with these restricted stock grants of $598, $518 and $464 was charged against income for the restricted stock awards granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIn March 2018, the Company's Compensation Committee, now known as the Compensation and Human Capital Committee (the \"Committee\"), granted equity-based awards pursuant to the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan (the \"Long-Term Incentive Plan\"). Certain participants under the Long-Term Incentive Plan were granted equity awards (the \"2018 LTIP Awards\"), with the number of shares of Class B Common Stock earned pursuant to such awards determined by applying a performance matrix consisting of a measurement of the combined results of the Company's 2018 growth in gross premiums earned and the Company's 2018 combined ratio. The combined ratio is calculated as a ratio of (A) losses and loss expenses incurred, plus other operating expenses, less commission and other income to (B) net premiums earned. No 2018 LTIP Awards were earned based on the Company's performance in 2018, and therefore no shares were issued pursuant to the 2018 LTIP Awards. In addition to the 2018 LTIP Awards, in March 2018 the Committee also granted Value Creation Incentive Plan awards (the \"2018 VCIP Awards\") to certain participants under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2018 VCIP Awards are performance-based equity awards that could be earned based on the Company's cumulative operating income over a three-year performance period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 relative to a cumulative operating income goal for the period set by the Committee in March 2018. For the purpose of the 2018 VCIP Awards, cumulative operating income is equal to income before taxes excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments. Any 2018 VCIP Awards earned would have been paid in unrestricted shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock at the end of the three-year performance period, but no later than March 15, 2021. No shares were earned under the 2018 VCIP Awards for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2020.\nOn November 13, 2018, the Company entered into an employment agreement with its Interim Chief Executive Officer, John D. Nichols, Jr. Pursuant to the terms of this employment agreement, on November 13, 2018, Mr. Nichols was granted 85,000 restricted shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock (the \"Nichols Stock Grant\"), of which 42,500 shares vested as of October 17, 2019, 21,250 shares vested as of October 17, 2020, and 21,250 shares will vest as of October 17, 2021. The Company incurred $193 of expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the Nichols Stock Grant.\nIn March 2019, the Committee granted equity-based awards pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan. Certain participants under the Long-Term Incentive Plan were granted equity awards (the \"2019 LTIP Awards\"), with the number of shares of Class B Common Stock earned pursuant to such awards determined by applying a performance matrix consisting of a corporate performance component as well as a personal performance component. The corporate performance component of the 2019 LTIP Awards was determined based on the Company's achievement of 2019 underwriting income compared to the plan target. The Company's underwriting income was calculated as income (loss) before federal income tax expense (benefit), less net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments, less net investment income. The personal performance component of the 2019 LTIP Awards was determined based on the achievement of personal goals that aligned with departmental and corporate objectives for 2019. 2019 LTIP Awards earned were paid in shares of restricted Class B Common Stock in early 2020. One-third of such shares will vest annually over the three-year period beginning one year from the date of issue. The Company incurred $110 of expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the 2019 LTIP Awards.\nOn May 22, 2019, the Company entered into an employment agreement with its new Chief Executive Officer, Jeremy D. Edgecliffe-Johnson. Pursuant to the terms of this employment agreement, on May 22, 2019, Mr. Edgecliffe-Johnson was granted 70,000 restricted shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock (the \"Edgecliffe-Johnson Stock Grant\"), of which 35,000 shares will vest as of June 1, 2022, 21,000 shares will vest as of June 1, 2023, and 14,000 shares will vest as of June 1, 2024. The Company incurred $240 of expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the Edgecliffe-Johnson Stock Grant.\nOn November 5, 2019, the Board of the Company, upon the recommendation of the Committee, approved equity compensation awards to be granted to seven members of senior management as of November 12, 2019 under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Board approved a total of $1,100 in grants of restricted shares of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock, which will vest on January 1, 2023, subject to the recipient\u2019s continued employment with the Company through the vesting date. The Company incurred $352 of expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to this grant.\nOn July 6, 2020, the Committee granted a total of 101,400 restricted shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock to certain members of senior management under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. These 101,400 restricted shares will vest on July 1, 2023, subject to the recipient\u2019s continued employment with the Company through the vesting date. The Company incurred $221 of expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to this grant.\nNote J - Segment Information\nThe Company has one reportable business segment in its operations: Property and Casualty Insurance. The property and casualty insurance segment provides multiple lines of insurance coverage primarily to commercial automobile companies, as well as to independent contractors who contract with commercial automobile companies.\nThe following table summarizes segment revenues for the years ended December 31:\nNote K - Earnings (Loss) Per Share\nThe following is a reconciliation of the denominators used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the years ended December 31:\nNote L - Concentrations of Credit Risk\nThe Company writes policies of excess insurance attaching above SIRs and also writes policies that contain per-claim deductibles. Those losses and claims that fall within the SIR limits are obligations of the insured; however, the Company writes surety bonds in favor of various regulatory agencies guaranteeing the insureds' payment of claims within the SIR. Further, specified portions of losses and claims incurred under large deductible policies, while obligations of the Company, are contractually reimbursable to the Company from the insureds. The Company requires collateral from its insureds to serve as a source of reimbursement if the Company is obligated to pay claims within the SIR by reason of an insured's default or if the insured fails to reimburse the Company for deductible amounts paid by the Company. Acceptable collateral may be provided in the form of letters of credit on Company-approved banks, Company-approved marketable securities or cash.\nThe amount of collateral required of an insured is determined by the financial condition of the insured, the type of obligations guaranteed by the Company, estimated reserves for incurred losses within the SIR or deductible that have been reported to the insured or the Company, estimated incurred but not reported losses, and estimated losses that are expected to occur within the SIR or be deductible prior to the next collateral adjustment date. In general, the Company attempts to hold collateral equal to 100% of the ultimate losses that would be paid by or due the Company in the event of an insured's default. Periodic audits are conducted by the Company to evaluate its exposure and the collateral required. If a deficiency in collateral is noted as the result of an audit, additional collateral is requested immediately. Because collateral amounts contain numerous estimates of the Company's exposure, are adjusted only periodically and are sometimes reduced based on the superior financial condition of the insured, the amount of collateral held by the Company at a given point in time may not be sufficient to fully reimburse the Company for all amounts due in the event of an insured's default. In that regard, the Company is not fully collateralized for the potential maximum exposure relating to FedEx Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries and related entities (\"FedEx\"). However, the Company believes that an event of default in excess of the collateralized amounts is remote.\nThe Company's balance sheet includes paid and estimated unpaid amounts recoverable from reinsurers under various agreements. These recoverables are only partially collateralized. The two largest amounts due from individual reinsurers, net of collateral and offsets, were $55,097 and $46,488 at December 31, 2020.\nNote M - Acquisition and Related Goodwill and Intangibles\nOn October 31, 2008, the Company purchased a commercial lines specialty insurance agency for a cash purchase price of $3,500. As part of the purchase, the Company recorded goodwill of $3,152 and intangible assets of $179. Accumulated amortization of intangible assets was $179 as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company conducted its annual impairment review. Based on the results of that review, the Company concluded that its entire goodwill balance was impaired, resulting in an impairment loss of $3,152. The Company utilized a market approach, which considered revenue and earnings multiples of its own and comparable company information. In the analysis, the Company considered the significant decline in its stock price and the decline in overall financial performance during 2018, particularly in more recent periods, as well as the downgrade to its A.M. Best Company, Inc. rating in late 2018.\nNote N - Fair Value\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. The following tables summarize fair value measurements by level for assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nAs of December 31, 2020:\nAs of December 31, 2019:\nLevel inputs, as defined by the FASB guidance, are as follows:\nLevel Input:\nInput Definition:\nLevel 1\nInputs are unadjusted, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.\nLevel 2\nInputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with market data at the measurement date.\nLevel 3\nUnobservable inputs that reflect management\u2019s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.\nThe Company did not have any Level 3 assets at December 31, 2020 or 2019. Level 3 assets, when present, are valued using various unobservable inputs including extrapolated data, proprietary models and indicative quotes.\nQuoted market prices are obtained whenever possible. Where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using broker/dealer quotes for specific securities. These techniques are significantly affected by the Company's assumptions, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows. Potential taxes and other transaction costs have not been considered in estimating fair values.\nTransfers between levels, if any, are recorded as of the beginning of the reporting period. There were no significant transfers of assets between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2020 or 2019.\nIn addition to the preceding disclosures on assets recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets, FASB guidance also requires the disclosure of fair values for certain other financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, whether or not such values are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.\nNon-financial instruments such as real estate, property and equipment, other assets, deferred income taxes and intangible assets, and certain financial instruments such as policy reserve liabilities are excluded from the fair value disclosures. Therefore, the fair value amounts cannot be aggregated to determine the underlying economic value of the Company. The following methods, assumptions and inputs were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument:\nLimited partnerships: The Company accounts for investments in limited partnerships using the equity method of accounting, which requires an investor in a limited partnership to carry the investment at its proportionate share of the limited partnership's equity. The underlying assets of the Company's investments in limited partnerships are carried primarily at fair value; therefore, the Company's carrying value of limited partnerships approximates fair value. As these investments are not actively traded and the corresponding inputs are based on data provided by the investees, they are classified as Level 3.\nCommercial mortgage loans: Commercial mortgage loans are carried primarily at amortized cost along with a valuation allowance for losses when necessary. These investments represent interests in commercial mortgage loans originated and serviced by a third party of which the Company shares, on a pro-rata basis, in all related cash flows of the underlying mortgage loans. The fair value of the Company\u2019s investment in these commercial mortgage loans is based on expected future cash flows discounted at the current interest rate for origination of similar quality loans, adjusted for specific loan risk. These investments are classified as Level 3.\nShort-term borrowings: The fair value of the Company's short-term borrowings is based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt, or, if no quoted market prices are available, on the current market interest rates available to the Company for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities.\nA summary of the carrying value and fair value by level of financial instruments not recorded at fair value on the Company's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nNote O - Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited)\nQuarterly results of operations are as follows:\nNote P - Statutory\nNet income of the Insurance Subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices, was $3,881, $25,302 and $36,236 for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Consolidated statutory capital and surplus for these Insurance Subsidiaries was $347,489 and $371,793 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of which $50,584 may be transferred by dividend or loan to Protective during calendar year 2021 with proper notification to, but without approval from, regulatory authorities.\nState regulatory authorities prescribe calculations of the minimum amount of statutory capital and surplus necessary for each insurance company to remain authorized. These computations are referred to as risk-based capital requirements and are based on a number of complex factors taking into consideration the quality and nature of assets, the historical adequacy of recorded liabilities and the specific nature of business conducted. At December 31, 2020, the minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements of the Insurance Subsidiaries was $136,544. Actual consolidated statutory capital and surplus at December 31, 2020 exceeded this requirement by $210,946.\nNote Q - Leases\nThe Company leases certain computer and related equipment using noncancelable operating leases. Lease expense for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $135, $302 and $204, respectively. At December 31, 2020, future lease payments for operating leases with initial or remaining noncancelable terms of one year or more consisted of the following:\nThe Company recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020 of $120, which are included within other assets and accounts pyable and other liabilities.\nNote R - Debt\nOn August 9, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement providing a revolving credit facility with a $40,000 limit, with the option for up to an additional $35,000 in incremental loans at the discretion of the lenders. This credit agreement has an expiration date of August 9, 2022. Interest on this revolving credit facility is referenced to the London Interbank Offered Rate and can be fixed for periods of up to one year at the Company's option. Outstanding drawings on this revolving credit facility were $20,000 as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the effective interest rate was 1.25%, and the Company had $20,000 remaining under the revolving credit facility. The current outstanding borrowings were used to repay the Company's previous line of credit. The Company's revolving credit facility has two financial covenants, each of which were met as of December 31, 2020. These covenants require the Company to have a minimum U.S. generally accepted accounting principles net worth and a maximum consolidated debt to equity ratio of 0.35.\nNote S - Related Parties\nThe Company utilizes the services of an investment firm of which one director of the Company is a partial owner. This investment firm manages equity securities and fixed income portfolios held by the Company with an aggregate market value of approximately $7,796 at December 31, 2020. Total commissions and net fees earned by this investment firm and its affiliates on these portfolios were $110, $145 and $103 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nNote T - Litigation, Commitments and Contingencies\nIn the ordinary, regular and routine course of their business, the Company and its Insurance Subsidiaries are frequently involved in various matters of litigation relating principally to claims for insurance coverage provided. No currently pending matter is deemed by management to be material to the Company, other than as noted below.\nPersonnel Staffing Group Litigation\nIn July 2019, Protective Insurance Company (\u201cProtective\u201d) was named as a defendant in an action brought by a former insured, Personnel Staffing Group d/b/a MVP Staffing (\u201cPSG\u201d), in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (the \u201cCalifornia Action\u201d) alleging that Protective had breached its workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy and had breached the duties of good faith and fair dealing. Protective provided workers\u2019 compensation insurance to PSG from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018, which was subject to a $500 per claim deductible to be paid by PSG. No specific damages were included in the complaint. In August 2019, Protective filed a motion to dismiss or stay the action. On April 28, 2020, Protective's motion to dismiss the California Action was granted without prejudice on grounds that Indiana is the more appropriate forum. On May 4, 2020, PSG filed a notice of appeal in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, challenging the order of dismissal in the California Action.\nIn August 2019, Protective filed a lawsuit against PSG in Marion County Superior Court, in Indianapolis, Indiana (the \u201cIndiana Court\u201d) alleging breach of contract, breach of the parties' collateral agreement, breach of the parties' indemnity agreement, and seeking a declaratory judgment regarding PSG\u2019s obligation to fund its ongoing claim deductible obligations and adequately collateralize Protective\u2019s current and ongoing claims exposure pursuant to terms of the parties' agreements (the \u201cIndiana Action\u201d). In October 2019, Protective amended the complaint to include allegations of misrepresentation as to source of coverage, negligent misrepresentation, fraud and racketeering and seeking injunctive relief. In November 2019, PSG filed a motion to dismiss the Indiana Action on the basis of comity with the California Action, claiming that California was the proper forum for Protective\u2019s claims.\nIn February 2020, the Indiana Court issued an order dismissing the Indiana Action without prejudice; the Indiana Court declined to rule on the legal effect of the forum selection clause in the parties\u2019 agreements, finding that any interpretation should be addressed by the court in the California Action. Following the court's granting of Protective\u2019s motion to dismiss in the California Action, on May 1, 2020, Protective filed a motion with the Indiana Court to re-open the Indiana Action, which was denied on September 23, 2020. On December 22, 2020, Protective moved for reconsideration of its Motion to Re-Open the Indiana Action, which the Indiana Court granted on February 5, 2021. On February 18, 2021, PSG moved for further reconsideration and for hearing, which was held on March 2, 2021. The Indiana court has taken the matter under advisement. Protective intends to vigorously pursue its claims against PSG, however, the ultimate outcome cannot be presently determined.\nPursuant to the terms of the workers\u2019 compensation policies, Protective has a duty to adjust and pay claims arising under the policies regardless of whether PSG makes payments to Protective for deductible obligations under the policies. Under its contractual obligations to Protective, PSG is required to maintain a \u201closs fund\u201d for the payment of claims, the balance of which is to remain at or above $4,000; in addition, PSG is required to provide collateral in an amount equal to 110% of Protective\u2019s current open case reserves on workers\u2019 compensation claims arising under the policies.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Protective had approximately $21,780 in receivables on claims arising under PSG\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation policies and had exhausted all collateral provided by PSG. Protective continues to pay claims settlements under the policies without reimbursement from PSG. For the past six months, the average monthly invoices have been approximately $740. PSG\u2019s estimated ultimate obligation under the agreements is approximately $47,000 as of December 31, 2020 (inclusive of the $21,780 in receivables noted above). At December 31, 2020, based on the Company's assessment that PSG will continue to operate as a business and that the terms of the agreement with PSG will be legally enforceable, the Company believes that it will fully collect all current and future amounts due from PSG relating to this matter.\nThe Company included this matter in its assessment of the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13, the new guidance for measuring CECL, which is discussed in Note A. A probability-of-default methodology was applied to projected estimated cash flows to estimate the allowance for expected credit losses for this matter. The Company considered the delay in reimbursement for claims paid as well as probability of default assumptions when analyzing the credit loss related to this matter. As of January 1, 2020, in conjunction with the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company recorded an allowance for expected credit losses of $15,000 ($11,850, net of tax) as a reduction to equity. During the third quarter of 2020, the Company performed an update to its CECL allowance calculation related to the PSG matter. As noted above, there have been further delays in the litigation process, which have extended the estimated cash flow timing. As a result of these delays and an increase in the estimated ultimate obligation, the Company recorded an additional allowance of $1,500 ($1,185, net of tax) within other operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations in the third quarter of 2020. No additional allowance was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. In the event of a situation that results in no recovery from PSG, the Company would incur an estimated charge to the consolidated statement of operations of $30,500 ($24,095, net of tax), which represents the estimated ultimate obligation discussed above less the CECL allowance.\nNote U - Subsequent Events\nProposed Merger with The Progressive Corporation\nMerger Agreement\nOn February 14, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with The Progressive Corporation, an Ohio corporation (\u201cProgressive\u201d), and Carnation Merger Sub Inc., an Indiana corporation and wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Progressive (\u201cMerger Sub\u201d). The Merger Agreement provides for, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the \u201cMerger\u201d), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease and Protective will continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Progressive.\nThe Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\"), at the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee of the Board, unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders, and approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The Merger is expected to close prior to the end of the third quarter of 2021. At the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, without par value, of the Company (other than each share of the Company\u2019s common stock that is owned by the Company as treasury stock or by any subsidiary of the Company and each share of the Company\u2019s common stock owned by Progressive, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Progressive immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive $23.30 in cash, without interest for a total transaction value of approximately $338 million.\nThe Merger Agreement contains various customary representations and warranties from each of the Company, Progressive and Merger Sub. The Company has also agreed to various customary covenants, including but not limited to conducting its business in the ordinary course and not engaging in certain types of transactions during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger. However, the Merger Agreement permits the Company to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends not to exceed $0.10 per share of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Merger is subject to certain conditions, including approval of the Merger by the Company's Class A shareholders, legal and regulatory approvals including from the Indiana Department of Insurance and the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, as well as other customary closing conditions.\nVoting and Support Agreement\nOn February 14, 2021, the Company also entered into a Voting and Support Agreement (the \u201cVoting Agreement\u201d) with Progressive and certain of the Company's shareholders. The Voting Agreement requires that the Company shareholders party to the Voting Agreement: (i) appear at the meeting of the holders of the Company's Class A common stock to consider resolutions to approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger or otherwise cause their shares of the Company's common stock to be counted as present for purposes of calculating a quorum, and (ii) vote their shares (a) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and any action reasonably requested by Progressive or the Board in furtherance of the foregoing, (b) against any action or agreement that would result in a material breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement and (c) against any takeover proposal or superior proposal (provided, that if the Board changes its recommendation with respect to the Merger, any shares of Class A common stock owned by such shareholders in excess of approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock will be voted in the same proportion as those shares of Class A common stock voted by the holders of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock that are not party to the Voting Agreement).\nThere can be no assurance that the Merger will occur or, if it does occur, of its terms or timing. For additional information regarding the risks associated with the Merger, please see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDividends\nOn February 22, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the Company's Class A and Class B Common Stock. The dividend per share will be payable March 10, 2021 to shareholders of record on March 5, 2021.",

    "item_9A": "Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Company carried out an evaluation as of December 31, 2020, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the \"Exchange Act\". Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms; and (b) accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The Company noted no change in its internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2020 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement's Responsibility for Financial Statements\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements and related information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the consolidated financial statements fairly reflect the form and substance of transactions and that the financial statements reasonably present the Company's financial position and results of operations in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Management has included in the Company's financial statements amounts that are based upon estimates and judgments which it believes are reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe Audit Committee meets periodically with financial management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm to review accounting, control, auditing and financial reporting matters.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on the Company's evaluation under this framework, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Protective Insurance Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Protective Insurance Corporation and subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Protective Insurance Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Protective Insurance Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d) and our report dated March 11, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP\nIndianapolis, Indiana\nMarch 11, 2021",
