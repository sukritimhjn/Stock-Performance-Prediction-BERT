    "item_1": "Item 1: Business\nIncorporated in 1967, Applied Materials, Inc. (Applied) is a Delaware corporation. A global company with a broad set of capabilities in materials engineering, Applied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display and related industries. With its diverse technology capabilities, Applied delivers products and services that improve device performance, yield and cost. Applied\u2019s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor chips, liquid crystal and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays, and other electronic devices. These customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components. Applied\u2019s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in October.\nApplied operates in three reportable segments: Semiconductor Systems, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets. A summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A discussion of factors that could affect operations is set forth under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nSemiconductor Systems\nApplied\u2019s Semiconductor Systems segment develops, manufactures and sells a wide range of manufacturing equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips, also referred to as integrated circuits (ICs). The Semiconductor Systems segment includes semiconductor capital equipment used for many steps of the chip making process including the transfer of patterns into device structures, transistor and interconnect fabrication, metrology, inspection and review, and packaging technologies for connecting finished IC die. Applied\u2019s patterning systems and technologies address challenges resulting from shrinking pattern dimensions and the growing complexity in vertical stacking found in today\u2019s most advanced semiconductor devices. Applied\u2019s transistor and interconnect products and technologies enable continued power and performance improvements of 3D transistors. Applied\u2019s metrology, inspection and review systems\u2019 imaging capabilities and algorithms employ optical and e-beam technologies to meet the most advanced technical demands in areas including self-aligned double and quad patterning, extreme ultraviolet layers, measurement-intensive optimal proximity correction mask qualification, and new 3D architectures. Applied\u2019s packaging technologies address challenges resulting from the increasing heterogeneous integration of multiple IC dies in a single package. Applied delivers leading-edge capabilities that enable chipmakers to establish accurate statistical process control, ramp up production runs rapidly, and achieve consistently high production yields. Applied\u2019s new equipment is sold to integrated device manufacturers and foundries worldwide.\nApplied Global Services\nThe Applied Global Services\u00ae (AGS) segment provides integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity, including spares, upgrades, services, remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor, display and other products. Customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system in more than 110 locations and trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites in 19 countries to support over 44,900 installed Applied semiconductor, display and other manufacturing systems worldwide. Applied offers the following general types of services and products under the Applied Global Services segment.\nDisplay and Adjacent Markets\nThe Display and Adjacent Markets segment is comprised of products for manufacturing liquid crystal displays (LCDs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and other display technologies for TVs, monitors, laptops, personal computers (PCs), electronic tablets, smart phones, and other consumer-oriented devices as well as equipment for processing flexible substrates. While similarities exist between the technologies utilized in semiconductor and display fabrication, the most significant differences are in the size and composition of the substrate. Substrates used to manufacture display panels and other devices are typically glass, although newer flexible materials are entering the market. Display and Adjacent Markets industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs and high resolution displays for mobile devices as well as new form factors, including thin, light, curved and flexible displays, and new applications such as augmented and virtual reality. The Display and Adjacent Markets segment offers a variety of technologies and products, including:\nBacklog\nApplied manufactures systems to meet demand represented by order backlog and customer commitments. Backlog consisted of: (1) orders for which written authorizations have been accepted, or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized; and (2) contractual service revenue and maintenance fees.\nBacklog by reportable segment as of October 25, 2020 and October 27, 2019 was as follows:\nOf the total backlog as of October 25, 2020, approximately 16% is not reasonably expected to be filled within the next 12 months.\nApplied\u2019s backlog on any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods, due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or order cancellations. Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment, subject to possible cancellation penalties. Delays in delivery schedules or a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on Applied\u2019s business and results of operations.\nManufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies\nApplied\u2019s worldwide manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembly, integration and test of various proprietary and commercial parts, components and subassemblies that are used to manufacture systems. Applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model under which manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries, including Germany, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Singapore, Taiwan, the United States and other countries in Asia. Applied uses qualified vendors, including contract manufacturers, to supply parts, services and product support.\nAlthough Applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers, this is not always possible. Accordingly, some key parts may be obtained from only a qualified single supplier or a limited group of qualified suppliers. Applied seeks to reduce costs and to lower the risks of manufacturing and service interruptions by selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for parts; monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers; maintaining appropriate inventories of parts; qualifying new parts on a timely basis; and ensuring quality and performance of parts.\nResearch, Development and Engineering\nApplied\u2019s long-term growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities, including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets. Applied\u2019s significant investments in research, development and engineering (RD&E) must generally enable it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during early-stage technology selection. Applied works closely with its global customers and ecosystem partners to design systems and processes that meet planned technical and production requirements.\nApplied\u2019s product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the United States, as well as in China, Europe, India, Israel, Singapore and Taiwan. In addition, certain outsourced RD&E activities, process support and customer demonstrations are performed in the United States, India, China, Singapore and Taiwan.\nMarketing and Sales\nBecause of the highly technical nature of its products, Applied markets and sells products worldwide almost entirely through a direct sales force.\nApplied has operations in many countries, with some of its business activities concentrated in certain geographic areas, and global and regional economic conditions can impact the company\u2019s business and financial results. Applied\u2019s business is based on capital equipment investments by major semiconductor, display and other manufacturers, and is subject to significant variability in customer demand for Applied\u2019s products. Customers\u2019 expenditures depend on many factors, including: general economic conditions; anticipated market demand and pricing for semiconductors, display technologies and other electronic devices; the development of new technologies; customers\u2019 factory utilization; capital resources and financing; and government policies and incentives. In addition, a significant driver in the semiconductor and display industries has been end-demand for mobile consumer products, which has been characterized by seasonality that impacts the timing of customer investments in manufacturing equipment and, in turn, Applied\u2019s business.\nInformation on net sales to unaffiliated customers and long-lived assets attributable to Applied\u2019s geographic regions is included in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following companies accounted for at least 10 percent of Applied\u2019s net sales in each fiscal year, which were for products and services in multiple reportable segments.\n______________________________\n* Less than 10%\nCompetition\nThe industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. Applied\u2019s ability to compete generally depends on its ability to commercialize its technology in a timely manner, continually improve its products, and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements. Significant competitive factors include technical capability and differentiation, productivity, cost-effectiveness and the ability to support a global customer base. The importance of these factors varies according to customers\u2019 needs, including product mix and respective product requirements, applications, and the timing and circumstances of purchasing decisions. Substantial competition exists in all areas of Applied\u2019s business. Competitors range from small companies that compete in a single region, which may benefit from policies and regulations that favor domestic companies, to global, diversified companies. Applied\u2019s ability to compete requires a high level of investment in RD&E, marketing and sales, and global customer support activities. Management believes that many of Applied\u2019s products have strong competitive positions.\nThe competitive environment for each segment is described below.\nThe semiconductor industry is driven by demand for advanced electronic products, including smartphones and other mobile devices, servers, personal computers, automotive electronics, storage, and other products. The growth of data and emerging end-market drivers such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, 5G networks, smart vehicles and augmented and virtual reality are also creating the next wave of growth for the industry. As a result, products within the Semiconductor Systems segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements, including transitions to smaller dimensions, increasingly complex chip architectures, new materials and an increasing number of applications. While certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements, some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach. The rapid pace of technological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and products and create opportunities for existing and new competitors. Applied offers a variety of differentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy customers\u2019 requirements to compete effectively in the marketplace. Applied allocates resources among its numerous product offerings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product depending on market requirements. There are a number of competitors serving the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry, which has experienced increasing consolidation. Some of these competitors offer a single product line and others offer multiple product lines, and range from serving a single region to global, diversified companies.\nProducts and services within the Applied Global Services segment complement Semiconductor Systems and Display and Adjacent Markets segments\u2019 products in markets that are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements and a diverse group of numerous competitors. To compete effectively, Applied offers products and services to improve tool performance, lower overall cost of ownership, and increase yields and productivity of customers\u2019 fab operations. Significant competitive factors include productivity, cost-effectiveness, and the level of technical service and support. The importance of these factors varies according to customers\u2019 needs and the type of products or services offered.\nProducts in the Display and Adjacent Markets segment are generally subject to strong competition from a number of major competitors primarily in Asia. Applied holds established market positions with its technically-differentiated LCD and OLED manufacturing solutions for PECVD, color filter PVD, PVD array, PVD touch panel, and TFT array testing, although its market position could change quickly due to customers\u2019 evolving requirements. Important factors affecting the competitive position of Applied\u2019s Display and Adjacent Markets products include: industry trends, Applied\u2019s ability to innovate and develop new products, and the extent to which Applied\u2019s products are technically-differentiated, as well as which customers within a highly concentrated customer base are making capital equipment investments and Applied\u2019s existing position at these customers.\nPatents and Licenses\nApplied\u2019s competitive position significantly depends upon its research, development, engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, as well as its patent position. Protection of Applied\u2019s technology assets through enforcement of its intellectual property rights, including patents, is important. Applied\u2019s practice is to file patent applications in the United States and other countries for inventions that it considers significant. Applied has approximately 14,300 patents in the United States and other countries, and additional applications are pending for new inventions. Although Applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent, the rights of Applied and the products made and sold under its patents, taken as a whole, are a significant element of its business. In addition to its patents, Applied possesses other intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, and copyrights.\nApplied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when it is determined to be in its best interest. Applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use, in several of its products, of certain patented technologies. Applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties. Royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been material to Applied\u2019s consolidated results of operations.\nIn the normal course of business, Applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement. In responding to such inquiries, it may become necessary or useful for Applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights. However, there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to Applied on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If Applied is not able to resolve or settle claims, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or successfully prosecute or defend its position, Applied\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nGovernmental Regulation\nAs a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws and regulations of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions. These regulations, which differ among jurisdictions, include those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade, antitrust, employment, immigration and travel regulations, privacy, and anti-corruption.\nWith respect to environmental, health and safety regulation, Applied maintains a number of programs that are primarily preventative in nature and regularly monitors ongoing compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, Applied has trained personnel to conduct investigations of any environmental, health, or safety incidents, including, but not limited to, spills, releases, or possible contamination. See also \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to Legal and Compliance - Applied is subject to risks associated with environmental, health and safety regulations\u201d for further details.\nApplied is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Applied\u2019s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in applicable tax laws, interpretations of applicable tax laws, amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, and valuation of deferred tax assets. See \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to Legal and Compliance - Applied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws\u201d. For additional discussions regarding the impact of compliance with income tax laws and regulations on Applied\u2019s business and operations, see also \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Results of Operations - Income Taxes\u201d and \u201cNote 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d.\nAdditionally, Applied is regulated under various international laws regarding the purchase and sale of goods and related items, including but not limited to those related to imposition of tariffs and other taxes, requirements for import/export licenses and limitations on transfer of intellectual property. See \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Associated with Operating a Global Business - International trade disputes could result in increase in tariffs and other trade restrictions and protectionist measures that could have an adverse impact on our operations\u201d for further details.\nApplied\u2019s People\nApplied\u2019s commitment to innovation begins with the commitment to creating an environment in which Applied\u2019s employees can do their best work. Applied\u2019s ability to create differentiated value in the marketplace is driven by the capability of the Company\u2019s people to anticipate technology inflections and integrate customer requirements. To achieve this level of value creation, Applied believes it must find, develop and keep a world-class global workforce. The Company invests in its employees by providing quality training and learning opportunities; promoting inclusion and diversity; and upholding a high standard of ethics and respect for human rights.\nAs of October 25, 2020, Applied employed approximately 24,000 regular full-time employees, of whom approximately 44%, 43% and 13% resided in the Asia-Pacific region, North America, and Europe, Middle East and Africa, respectively. Applied\u2019s team spans 19 countries, reflecting various cultures, backgrounds, ages, gender identity, sexual orientation, and ethnicities.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nApplied knows that its diversity is one of its greatest strengths. The Company therefore strives to provide fair and equal opportunity for career development and advancement to all its employees and incorporates respect for diverse backgrounds and perspectives into the Company\u2019s culture at every level - from strategy and policy down to everyday interactions.\nApplied expects that its commitment to strengthening the Company\u2019s culture of inclusion will broaden the diversity of its workplace and help Applied build a culture that benefits everyone. In recent years, Applied continued to make progress in its culture of inclusion journey, including, among other things, expanding gender diversity on the Company\u2019s Board to 30% female membership, increasing female representation in the U.S. and global workforce, and increasing U.S. underrepresented minority representation.\nTalent Acquisition and Retention\nApplied believes that its future success is highly dependent upon the Company\u2019s continued ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees. As part of the Company\u2019s effort to attract and motivate employees, Applied offers competitive rewards, compensation and benefits, including an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, parental and family leave, adoption credits, holiday and paid time off, and tuition assistance.\nEmployee Learning & Development\nApplied believes continuous learning by its people feeds the Company\u2019s pipeline of innovation and pays off in employee retention. Applied\u2019s business units maintain an independent strategy for skill-building, using content that is owned, supervised, developed, and managed by each unit\u2019s learning team. At the same time, these skill-building programs are aligned around a common set of objectives and framework focused on compliance, technical, professional and management development. For example, the Company\u2019s Environmental, Health & Safety (EHS) and Sustainability organization leads employee training and awareness on EHS management issues and the certification processes for safety and skills related to technical manufacturing and engineering work. In addition, all employees have opportunities for training on a wide range of general professional skills that are designed to help them to be more effective in their current and future roles. There is an expectation that every employee has a development goal as a part of individual performance objectives. Historically more than 85% of employees have had development objectives.\nEmployee Engagement, Organizational Health and Pandemic Response\nApplied manages and measures organizational health with a view to gaining insight into employees\u2019 experiences, levels of workplace satisfaction, and feelings of engagement and inclusion with the company. The Company uses McKinsey & Company\u2019s Organizational Health Index (OHI) and employee engagement pulse surveys to measure its organizational health and employee experiences. In fiscal 2019, Applied achieved an overall \u201chealthy\u201d rating on the OHI and continued to rank in the top quartile for overall health in the McKinsey database. Insights from the Company\u2019s OHI survey are used to develop both company-wide and business unit level organizational and talent development plans.\nApplied\u2019s top priority during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic remains protecting the health and safety of its employees and their families, customers and community. Applied continues to maintain workplace flexibility such as working remotely where possible to reduce the number of people who are on campus each day. Applied is keeping its critical labs and operations active consistent with local laws and regulations and continuing to support customers. In the interest of public health, all onsite operations are utilizing the minimum number of people to safely execute tasks and following enhanced safety and health protocols-including screenings, social distancing, and use of personal protective equipment.\nAdditional information regarding Applied\u2019s activities related to its people and sustainability, as well as its workforce diversity data, can be found in Applied\u2019s latest Sustainability Report and Annex thereto, which are located on its website at https://www.appliedmaterials.com/news/citizenship_report.html.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors could materially and adversely affect Applied\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied\u2019s operations and financial results.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread, including quarantines, facility closures, travel and logistics restrictions, border controls, and shelter in place or stay at home and social distancing orders, have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact Applied\u2019s supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of Applied\u2019s customers, suppliers and partners globally. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic and the impacts on our business and the global economy from the effects of the ongoing pandemic and response measures. While Applied continues to see progress in the recovery within its supply chain, travel and logistics restrictions, shelter-in-place orders and other measures, including working remotely, social distancing and other policies implemented in foreign and domestic sites to protect the health and safety of employees, have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, transportation disruptions (such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures), production delays and capacity limitations at Applied and some of its customers, suppliers and partners, as well as reduced workforce availability or productivity at Applied and customer sites, and additional data, information and cyber security risks associated with an extensive workforce now working remotely full-time. There can be no assurance that Applied or its suppliers will be able to maintain manufacturing operations at current levels. In addition, the pandemic and the impact of the foregoing measures in various forms and in varying degrees have had, and may continue to have a significant adverse impact on the global economic activity and could also result in a reduced demand for our products, delayed deliveries or installation, cancelled orders or increase in logistics and operating costs, and materially adversely affect Applied\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts Applied\u2019s financial condition and results of operations and the global economy will depend on future developments beyond our control, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, availability of effective vaccines against COVID-19, effectiveness of government stimulus programs, resurgence of COVID-19, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activity can resume, and the severity and duration of the global economic downturn that results from the pandemic.\nRisks Associated with Operating a Global Business\nApplied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.\nApplied has product development, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other operations distributed throughout many countries, and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas. Moreover, in fiscal 2020, approximately 90% of Applied\u2019s net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. As a result of the global nature of its operations, Applied\u2019s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022uncertain global economic and political business conditions and demands;\n\u2022political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;\n\u2022direct and indirect global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies (including the impact of the implementation and interpretation of the rules published by the U.S. Department of Commerce on April 28, 2020 and August 17, 2020 relating to certain export license requirements and the ability to obtain required import and export licenses), trade sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes;\n\u2022customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea and China;\n\u2022variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations, including contract, intellectual property, cybersecurity, data privacy, labor, tax, and import/export laws, and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;\n\u2022ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;\n\u2022positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;\n\u2022fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs;\n\u2022delays or restrictions in shipping materials or finished products between and within countries;\n\u2022geographically diverse operations and projects, and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls, and comply with environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022supply chain interruptions, and service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers, or other events beyond our control;\n\u2022failure to effectively manage a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;\n\u2022variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;\n\u2022fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, Israeli shekel, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Singapore dollar, Chinese yuan or Korean won;\n\u2022the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;\n\u2022performance of third party providers of outsourced functions, including certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, information technology and other activities;\n\u2022political instability, natural disasters, regional or global health epidemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;\n\u2022challenges in hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries;\n\u2022the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions; and\n\u2022uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries, including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries.\nAs more fully discussed in the risk factor \u201cThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied\u2019s operations and financial results\u201d above, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread, including quarantines, facility closures, travel and logistics restrictions, border controls, and shelter in place or stay at home and social distancing orders, have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact Applied\u2019s supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of Applied\u2019s customers, suppliers and partners globally.\nInternational trade disputes could result in increases in tariffs and other trade restrictions and protectionist measures that could adversely impact our operations and reduce the competitiveness of our products relative to local and global competitors.\nWe sell a significant majority of our products into countries outside of the United States including China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea. We also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside of the United States. There is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea and the United States, that political, diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes, impacts and/or disruptions, in particular, with respect to those affecting the semiconductor industry. The United States and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose trade restrictions, and have also levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. Increases in tariffs, additional taxes or other trade restrictions and retaliatory measures may increasingly impact end-user demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nCertain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses, and our inability to obtain such licenses have limited and could further limit our markets and impact our business. For example, on April 28, 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce published rules, which became effective on June 29, 2020, that expanded export license requirements for U.S. companies that sell certain products to entities in China whose actions or functions are intended to support military end uses, and eliminated certain export license exceptions that applied to exports of certain items to China. On September 25, 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce designated a certain customer in China as a military end user. These trade restrictions and their interpretation by the U.S. Department of Commerce require us to apply for additional export licenses for certain of our products sold to certain customers in China, including products sold to customers that the U.S. Department of Commerce has determined to present a risk of diversion to a military end use. Obtaining export licenses may be difficult, costly and time-consuming, and our inability to obtain such licenses could limit our markets in China and adversely affect our results of operations. The implementation and interpretation of these rules are ongoing and their impact on our business is uncertain, and these rules and other regulatory changes that have occurred and may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, on August 17, 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce published a final rule that does not impose additional license requirements for the export of Applied\u2019s products but could require certain of Applied\u2019s customers to obtain licenses for the export of wafers, chipsets and certain related items to Huawei or its affiliates that are the direct product of US-origin semiconductor manufacturing equipment and thus could potentially limit the demand for certain of Applied\u2019s products from such customers.\nIn addition, government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied\u2019s business. Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, markets that represent a significant portion of Applied\u2019s current business as well as long-term growth opportunities.\nApplied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.\nUncertain global economic and business conditions, along with uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, pose challenges to the industries in which Applied operates. Markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. Economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from purchasing for equipment or services, which may have an adverse impact on Applied\u2019s revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect Applied\u2019s ability to manage operations and deliver its products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied\u2019s ability to compete effectively.\nIn particular, impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in increased volatility in global financial markets, increases in levels of unemployment, and economic uncertainty, and may lead to significant negative impacts on customer spending, demand for our products, the ability of our customers to pay, our financial condition and the financial condition of our suppliers.\nUncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If Applied does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied\u2019s ability to capitalize on opportunities. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.\nApplied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied\u2019s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate (including from impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied\u2019s ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect its ability to manage its operations.\nRisks Associated with Applied\u2019s Industry\nThe industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict.\nAs a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries, Applied is subject to variable industry conditions, since demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors, including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes, the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers, production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies, end-user demand, customers\u2019 capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, consumer buying patterns and general economic conditions. Applied\u2019s industries historically have been cyclical, and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology. These changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can have a significant impact on Applied\u2019s net sales, operating expenses, gross margins and net income. The amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on Applied\u2019s results of operations.\nTo meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. If Applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its effects, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, during periods of decreasing demand, Applied\u2019s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted.\nApplied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.\nApplied\u2019s customer base is highly concentrated, and has become increasingly so as a result of continued consolidation. Applied\u2019s customer base is also geographically concentrated, particularly in China, Taiwan and Korea. A relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of Applied\u2019s business. As a result, the actions of even a single customer can expose Applied\u2019s business and results of operations to greater volatility. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, including as a result of changes in government policy, have varied and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and have a significant impact on Applied\u2019s net sales, gross margins and net income. Applied\u2019s products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders (including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), Applied may not be able to replace the business, which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition. The concentration of Applied\u2019s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on Applied\u2019s results of operations and cash flow. To the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints, Applied may incur additional bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on its results of operations. Major customers may also seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied, which may have a negative impact on Applied\u2019s business, cash flow, revenue and gross margins.\nApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.\nThe global semiconductor, display and related industries in which Applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied\u2019s products and its consolidated results of operations, including:\n\u2022the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on customers\u2019 businesses and on demand for Applied\u2019s products;\n\u2022increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers\u2019 ability to raise the necessary capital;\n\u2022trade, regulatory or tax policies impacting the timing of customers\u2019 investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;\n\u2022differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and other industries in which Applied operates;\n\u2022the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;\n\u2022the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;\n\u2022the need for customers to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;\n\u2022the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;\n\u2022manufacturers\u2019 ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment;\n\u2022the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers\u2019 purchasing decisions;\n\u2022requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;\n\u2022price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;\n\u2022the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers\u2019 systems are available for production;\n\u2022the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and\n\u2022the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.\nApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.\nThe largest proportion of Applied\u2019s consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the Semiconductor Systems segment to the global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing equipment and service products, including:\n\u2022the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied\u2019s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;\n\u2022the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including shrinking geometries, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;\n\u2022the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;\n\u2022the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;\n\u2022the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller geometries to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;\n\u2022challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers\u2019 levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied\u2019s products have lower relative market presence;\n\u2022the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;\n\u2022semiconductor manufacturer\u2019s ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, and the resulting effect on their need to purchase new equipment and services;\n\u2022shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;\n\u2022competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;\n\u2022consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers;\n\u2022shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies, and manufacturing processes for advanced circuit technologies, that impact the equipment requirements of Applied\u2019s foundry customers;\n\u2022the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where Applied\u2019s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions;\n\u2022investment in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental policies in China and the United States;\n\u2022the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products; and\n\u2022the growing importance of specialty markets (such as Internet of Things, communications, automotive, power and sensors) that use mature process technologies and have a low barrier to entry.\nIf Applied does not accurately forecast and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry.\nThe global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. Industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs, and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. The display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied\u2019s display products and services, including:\n\u2022the importance of new types of display technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED), low temperature polysilicon (LTPS) and metal oxide transistor backplanes, flexible displays, and new touch panel films;\n\u2022the increasing cost of research and development, and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied\u2019s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;\n\u2022the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China, which may be affected by changes in local economic conditions and governmental policies in China, Korea, Japan and the United States;\n\u2022the importance of increasing market positions in products and technologies with growing demand;\n\u2022the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for TVs and to new display technologies for TVs and mobile applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied\u2019s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment; and\n\u2022fluctuations in customer spending quarter over quarter and year over year for display manufacturing equipment, concentration of display manufacturer customers and their ability to successfully commercialize new products and technologies, and uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.\nIf Applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows, Applied\u2019s business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nThe industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes.\nApplied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, and its future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products, and its ability to increase its position in its current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment, and that may require greater collaboration with customers and other industry participants, have grown more complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs, longer development cycles, lower profits and may have unforeseen product design or manufacturing defects. To compete successfully, Applied must:\n\u2022identify and address technology inflections, market changes, competitor innovations, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand in a timely and effective manner;\n\u2022develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;\n\u2022differentiate its products from those of competitors, meet customers\u2019 performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;\n\u2022maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications, customers and customer requirements;\n\u2022enhance its worldwide operations across its businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;\n\u2022focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers\u2019 high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;\n\u2022effectively allocate resources between its existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;\n\u2022improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;\n\u2022accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;\n\u2022improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;\n\u2022adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;\n\u2022qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with its customers; and\n\u2022implement changes in its design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management.\nIf Applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to Applied\u2019s Business, Finance and Operations\nApplied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures.\nApplied engages in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for Applied. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments, such as the proposed acquisition of Kokusai Electric, involve numerous risks to Applied\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to:\n\u2022inability to complete proposed transactions timely or at all due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee (which, in the case of the stock purchase agreement related to the proposed acquisition of Kokusai Electric, Applied will be obligated to pay in the amount of $154 million if such agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals);\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;\n\u2022the failure to realize expected revenues, gross and operating margins, net income and other returns from acquired businesses;\n\u2022requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of Applied\u2019s existing business or the acquired business;\n\u2022following completion of acquisitions, ineffective integration of businesses, operations, systems, digital and physical security, technologies, products, employees, compliance programs, changes in laws or regulations, including tax laws, or other factors, may impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;\n\u2022failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;\n\u2022dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;\n\u2022inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied\u2019s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;\n\u2022failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;\n\u2022the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;\n\u2022potential changes in Applied\u2019s credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s access to and cost of capital;\n\u2022reductions in cash balances or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which increase interest expense, and reductions in cash balances, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;\n\u2022exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;\n\u2022challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;\n\u2022inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;\n\u2022inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company\u2019s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, cybersecurity, privacy policies and compliance programs, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;\n\u2022impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;\n\u2022the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;\n\u2022unknown, underestimated, undisclosed or undetected commitments or liabilities or non-compliance with laws, regulations or policies; and\n\u2022the inappropriate scale of acquired entities\u2019 critical resources or facilities for business needs.\nApplied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. In addition, new legislation, additional regulations or global economic or political conditions may affect or impair our ability to invest in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so. The risks to Applied\u2019s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.\nApplied continually assesses the strategic fit of its businesses and may from time to time seek to divest portions of its business that are not deemed to fit with its strategic plan. Divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties, such as ability to sell such businesses on satisfactory price and terms and in a timely manner (including long and costly sales processes and the possibility of lengthy and potentially unsuccessful attempts by a buyer to receive required regulatory approvals), or at all, disruption to other parts of the businesses and distraction of management, allocation of internal resources that would otherwise be devoted to completing strategic acquisitions, loss of key employees or customers, exposure to unanticipated liabilities (including, among other things, those arising from representations and warranties made to a buyer regarding the businesses) or ongoing obligations to support the businesses following such divestitures, and other adverse financial impacts.\nApplied\u2019s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business.\nApplied has $5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon a change of control of Applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. Applied also has in place a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, and a $2.0 billion term loan facility to finance in part its planned acquisition of Kokusai Electric. While no amounts were outstanding under either credit agreement as of October 25, 2020, Applied may borrow amounts in the future under either or both of these agreements. Applied may also enter into new financing arrangements. Applied\u2019s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. Significant changes in Applied\u2019s credit rating, disruptions in the global financial markets or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on Applied\u2019s access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. If Applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default under other of Applied\u2019s obligations. There can be no assurance that Applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time.\nApplied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.\nAs part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally, or those developed in collaboration with third parties, or obtained through acquisitions. Applied\u2019s ability to successfully expand its business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;\n\u2022the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;\n\u2022differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;\n\u2022Applied\u2019s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;\n\u2022the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;\n\u2022the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;\n\u2022the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;\n\u2022new materials, processes and technologies;\n\u2022the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;\n\u2022new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;\n\u2022new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;\n\u2022entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;\n\u2022third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.\nIn addition, Applied from time to time receives funding from United States and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied is often subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations.\nSupply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect Applied\u2019s ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory.\nApplied\u2019s business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, including components and subassemblies, from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. The inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of parts can have an adverse impact on Applied\u2019s manufacturing operations and ability to meet customer demand for equipment, spares and services. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing. Variable industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for companies throughout its supply chain. These conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. Applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver or install products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:\n\u2022the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;\n\u2022volatility in the availability and cost of materials;\n\u2022difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;\n\u2022shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;\n\u2022information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third party supplier or service provider; and\n\u2022natural disasters or other events beyond Applied\u2019s control (such as earthquakes, utility interruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, storms or extreme weather conditions, fires, regional economic downturns, regional or global health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical turmoil, increased trade restrictions between the U.S. and China and other countries, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) in locations where it or its customers or suppliers have manufacturing, research, engineering or other operations.\nAs more fully discussed in the risk factor \u201cThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied\u2019s operations and financial results\u201d above, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread, including quarantines, facility closures, travel and logistics restrictions, border controls, and shelter in place or stay at home and social distancing orders, have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact Applied\u2019s supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of Applied\u2019s customers, suppliers and partners globally.\nIf a supplier fails to meet Applied\u2019s requirements concerning quality, cost, protection of intellectual property, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs or other difficulties, and may also result in a loss of Applied\u2019s ability to protect, enforce and extract the full value of its or its customers\u2019 and other third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, which could have an adverse impact on its business and competitive position and subject Applied to legal proceedings and claims. If Applied is unable to meet its customers\u2019 demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components, it could affect its ability to manage its operations, and have an adverse impact on Applied\u2019s business, results of operations and customer relationships. In addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in Applied\u2019s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on Applied\u2019s working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applied\u2019s products is different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize or rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if customers reduce or delay orders, Applied may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges.\nThe ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied\u2019s success.\nApplied\u2019s success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders with expertise and capabilities, representing diverse backgrounds and experiences. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, Applied\u2019s organizational structure, increasing global competition for talent, the availability of qualified employees in the local and global markets, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the attractiveness of Applied\u2019s compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders, we may be unable to fully capitalize on current and new market opportunities, which could adversely impact Applied\u2019s business and results of operations. The loss or retirement of employees presents particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.\nThe failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact Applied\u2019s business and results of operations.\nApplied periodically implements new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage its business operations, align its global organizations and enable future growth. Implementation of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of significant personnel, training and financial resources, and entails risks to Applied\u2019s business operations. If Applied does not successfully implement enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements, or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties, such as its ability to track orders, timely manufacture and ship products, project inventory requirements, effectively manage its supply chain and allocate human resources, aggregate financial data and report operating results, and otherwise effectively manage its business, all of which could result in quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities, and otherwise adversely affect Applied\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nApplied may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or long-lived assets.\nApplied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied\u2019s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied\u2019s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied\u2019s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Cybersecurity\nApplied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.\nApplied\u2019s success depends in significant part on the protection of its patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Infringement of Applied\u2019s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse. Applied\u2019s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If Applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against Applied, which could have a negative impact on its business. If Applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation may impact Applied\u2019s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of Applied\u2019s intellectual property.\nThird parties may also assert claims against Applied and its products. Claims that Applied\u2019s products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. The inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on Applied\u2019s business. In addition, Applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm Applied\u2019s business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm its competitive position, and prevent Applied from selling certain products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied\u2019s business and results of operations.\nApplied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.\nIn the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems, including systems owned and maintained by Applied or third party providers. These data include confidential information and intellectual property belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. All information systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure. Applied has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to these information systems, to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. Applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation of intellectual property, and corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (Applied\u2019s and that of third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of Applied\u2019s investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. Compliance with, and changes to, laws and regulations concerning privacy and information security could result in significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against Applied by regulatory authorities or other third parties.\nRisks Related to Legal and Compliance\nApplied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws.\nApplied is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied\u2019s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in applicable tax laws, interpretations of applicable tax laws, amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, and valuation of deferred tax assets. An increase in Applied\u2019s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on Applied\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nConsistent with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. In certain foreign jurisdictions, conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to Applied. To obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied\u2019s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or Applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions.\nIn addition, Applied is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied\u2019s historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.\nApplied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.\nApplied from time to time is, and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification, product warranty or has other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.\nLegal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management\u2019s attention and other Applied resources; inhibit Applied\u2019s ability to sell its products; result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and negatively affect Applied\u2019s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.\nApplied is subject to risks associated with environmental, health and safety regulations.\nApplied is subject to environmental, health and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture, shipping and use of its products; handling, discharge, recycling and disposal of hazardous materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale, shipping or use of certain of its products; limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and a decrease in the value of its real property. Applied could be required to alter its manufacturing and operations and incur substantial expense in order to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could subject Applied to significant costs and liabilities that could adversely affect Applied\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nApplied is exposed to various risks related to the global regulatory environment.\nAs a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade, antitrust, employment, immigration and travel regulations, privacy, and anti-corruption. Changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact Applied\u2019s business operations. Violations of law, rules and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, restrictions on Applied\u2019s business, and damage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition and results of operations.",

Applied continues to maintain workplace flexibility such as working remotely where possible to reduce the number of people who are on campus each day. Applied is keeping its critical labs and operations active and continuing to support customers. In the interest of public health, all onsite operations are utilizing the minimum number of people to safely execute tasks and following enhanced safety and health protocols-including screenings, social distancing, and use of personal protective equipment.\nApplied has a multi-phase plan to return to working on-site, which takes into consideration factors such as Applied\u2019s business needs, local government regulations, community case trends, and recommendation from public health officials. The plan involves multiple phases that gradually allow additional workers to return onsite while practicing social distancing and other safety measures.\nApplied Materials is committed to helping those most impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In regions around the world, Applied and its Foundation are addressing immediate humanitarian needs while investing resources to combat the long-term effect of the virus on the nonprofit organizations in its communities. Applied has shared masks and equipment with medical facilities, provided blood analysis systems to medical professionals and sent emergency support to food banks.\nApplied will continue to monitor and evaluate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and will work to respond appropriately to the impact of COVID-19 on its business, its customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 businesses and its communities.\nOverview\nApplied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display, and related industries. Applied\u2019s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, liquid crystal and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays, and other electronic devices. These customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components. Each of Applied\u2019s businesses is subject to variable industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies, and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic and market conditions, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes.\nApplied operates in three reportable segments: Semiconductor Systems, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets. A summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A discussion of factors that could affect Applied\u2019s operations is set forth under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. Product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the United States, Europe, Israel, and Asia. Applied\u2019s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force.\nApplied\u2019s results are driven primarily by customer spending on capital equipment and services to support key technology transitions or to increase production volume in response to worldwide demand for semiconductors and displays. Spending by semiconductor customers, which include companies that operate in the foundry, logic and memory markets, is driven by demand for advanced electronic products, including smartphones and other mobile devices, servers, personal computers, automotive devices, storage, and other products. The growth of data and emerging end-market drivers such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, 5G networks, smart vehicles and augmented and virtual reality are also creating the next wave of growth for the industry. As a result, products within the Semiconductor Systems segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements, including transitions to smaller dimensions, increasingly complex chip architectures, new materials and an increasing number of applications. Demand for display manufacturing equipment spending depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for next-generation mobile devices, and investments in new types of display technologies. While certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements, some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach. The timing of customer investment in manufacturing equipment is also affected by the timing of next-generation process development and the timing of capacity expansion to meet end-market demand. In light of these conditions, Applied\u2019s results can vary significantly year-over-year, as well as quarter-over-quarter.\nApplied\u2019s strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers\u2019 challenges at technology inflections; expanding its served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries; and growing its services business. Applied\u2019s long-term growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities, including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets. Applied\u2019s significant investments in research, development and engineering must generally enable it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during early-stage technology selection. Applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements.\nThe following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years:\nFiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 each contained 52 weeks.\nFiscal 2018 included a one-time expense related to the enactment of U.S. income tax law that reduced diluted earnings per share by $1.08.\nDuring fiscal 2020, COVID-19 was designated a pandemic and the resulting restrictions put in place worldwide impacted Applied\u2019s supply chains and manufacturing operations. The semiconductor industry was deemed to be part of a U.S. Critical Infrastructure Sector, allowing Applied to continue operations, while ensuring compliance with orders and restrictions imposed by government authorities by putting additional precautionary measures in place to keep its workplaces healthy and safe, everywhere Applied operates in the world.\nEven with the unprecedented challenges faced during the pandemic, semiconductor equipment customers continued to make strategic investments in new technology transitions during fiscal 2020. Foundry and logic spending increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 led by customer investment in advanced foundry-logic nodes. Spending by memory customers increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, as the market began to recover from excess supply and inventory levels and customers invested in new technology development. Applied saw continued growth in its services business in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 driven by an increase in the installed base of equipment and in long-term service agreements. Applied\u2019s display and adjacent markets revenue declined slightly in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, due to weak demand for display manufacturing equipment for TVs.\nIn response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and evolving conditions and worldwide response, Applied made adjustments to its global operations and continues to see recovery within its supply chain and strong demand from semiconductor customers. However, the situation remains fluid and uncertain. Applied is actively managing its responses in collaboration with its employees, customers and suppliers. For additional risks associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, see the risk factor entitled \u201cThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied\u2019s operations and financial results\u201d in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the periods indicated were as follows:\nNet sales in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 increased primarily due to increased customer investments in semiconductor equipment and spending on services. Net sales in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 decreased primarily due to decreased customer investments in semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment. The Semiconductor Systems segment continued to represent the largest contributor of net sales.\nNet sales by geographic region, determined by the location of customers\u2019 facilities to which products were shipped, were as follows:\nThe changes in net sales in all regions in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily reflected changes in semiconductor equipment spending. The increase in net sales to customers in China, Taiwan and Korea for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to increased investments in semiconductor manufacturing equipment and customer spending on comprehensive service agreements. The increase in China was partially offset by a decrease in customer spending in display manufacturing equipment. The decrease in net sales to customers in Japan and United States for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily reflected a decrease in investments in semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment. The decrease in net sales to customers in Southeast Asia and Europe for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily reflected a decrease in investments in semiconductor manufacturing equipment and customer spending on legacy systems and spares.\nThe changes in net sales in all regions in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily reflected changes in semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment spending and customer and product mix. The increase in net sales to customers in Taiwan and United States for fiscal 2019 compared the prior year was primarily due to increased investments in semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The decrease in net sales to customers in all other regions for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily reflected a decrease in investments in semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment.\nGross Margin\nGross margins for the periods indicated were as follows:\nGross margin in fiscal 2020 increased compared to fiscal 2019 year primarily due to the increase in net sales and favorable changes in customer and product mix, partially offset by higher freight costs, and higher personnel costs due to increase in headcount to provide manufacturing capacity and flexibility, underutilization of headcount due to COVID-19 restrictions preventing travel to customer site and incremental employee compensation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross margin in fiscal 2019 decreased compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to the decrease in net sales and unfavorable changes in customer and product mix.\nGross margin during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 included $103 million, $89 million and $87 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.\nResearch, Development and Engineering\nResearch, Development and Engineering (RD&E) expenses for the periods indicated were as follows:\nApplied\u2019s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides. Development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. Most of Applied\u2019s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. In certain instances, Applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market.\nManagement believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in RD&E to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers\u2019 most advanced designs. Applied has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in RD&E in order to continue to offer new products and technologies.\nApplied continued its RD&E investments across Semiconductor Systems and Display and Adjacent Markets on the development of new unit process systems and integrated materials solutions. Areas of investment include etch, deposition, inspection, patterning, packaging and other technologies to improve chip performance, power, area, cost and time-to-market. In Display and Adjacent Markets, RD&E investments were focused on expanding the company\u2019s market opportunity with new display technologies.\nThe increases in RD&E expenses during fiscal 2020 compared fiscal 2019 were primarily due to additional headcount and higher expense associated with share-based compensation and variable compensation. RD&E expenses increased slightly in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to additional headcount and increased research and development spending in Semiconductor Systems and Display and Adjacent Market segments. These increases reflect Applied\u2019s ongoing investments in product development initiatives, consistent with the Company\u2019s growth strategy. Applied continued to prioritize existing RD&E investments in technical capabilities and critical research and development programs in current and new markets, with a focus on semiconductor technologies.\nRD&E expense during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 included $116 million, $99 million and $96 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.\nMarketing and Selling\nMarketing and selling expenses for the periods indicated were as follows:\nMarketing and selling expenses remained relatively flat in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 and 2018. Marketing and selling expenses for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 included $36 million, $31 million and $31 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses for the periods indicated were as follows:\nG&A expenses in fiscal 2020 increased compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher expense associated with acquisition integration and deal costs, variable compensation, and share-based compensation. General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2019 decreased slightly compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower variable compensation expenses.\nG&A expenses during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 included $52 million, $44 million and $44 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.\nInterest Expense and Interest and Other Income (loss), net\nInterest expense and interest and other income (loss), net for the periods indicated were as follows:\nInterest expenses incurred were primarily associated with the senior unsecured notes. Interest expense in fiscal 2020 remained relatively flat compared fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.\nInterest and other income, net primarily includes interest earned on cash and investments, realized gains or losses on sales of securities and impairment of strategic investments. Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2019, unrealized gains and losses on investments classified as equity investments are recognized in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01 Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, these unrealized gains and temporary losses were included within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of any related tax effect. Interest and other income, net in fiscal 2020 decreased compared to fiscal 2019, primarily driven by lower interest income and a loss on early extinguishment of debt. In addition, unrealized gains on equity investment securities from investments during fiscal 2020 was lower compared to fiscal 2019. Interest and other income, net in fiscal 2019 increased compared to fiscal 2018 primarily driven by unrealized gains on equity investment securities.\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the periods indicated were as follows:\nApplied\u2019s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pre-tax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates, conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives. It is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period, such as changes in income tax laws and the resolution of prior years\u2019 income tax filings.\nOn June 14, 2019, the U.S. government released regulations that significantly affect how the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) is interpreted. As a result, Applied reversed a tax benefit of $96 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 that had been realized in the first half of fiscal 2019. An accounting policy may be selected to treat GILTI temporary differences in taxable income either as a current-period expense when incurred (period cost method) or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes (deferred method). Applied has chosen the period cost method.\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). The enactment of the CARES Act does not result in any material adjustments to Applied\u2019s provision for income taxes.\nApplied\u2019s effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was lower than fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decline in the tax expense from changes to uncertain tax positions year-over-year, an increased tax benefit from tax credits, and increased excess stock compensation tax benefits. This benefit was partly offset by an unfavorable settlement of an uncertain tax position in fiscal 2020.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was lower than fiscal 2018 primarily due to tax expense of $1.1 billion in fiscal 2018 for the transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act. Excluding the tax expense of $1.1 billion, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was higher than fiscal 2018 primarily due to certain provisions in the Tax Act becoming effective in fiscal 2019, tax expense of $87 million in fiscal 2019 related to changes in uncertain tax positions and the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation in fiscal 2019 being $42 million less than the prior fiscal year.\nSegment Information\nApplied reports financial results in three segments: Semiconductor Systems, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets. A description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Corporate and Other category includes revenues from products, as well as costs of products sold, for fabricating solar photovoltaic cells and modules and certain operating expenses that are not allocated to its reportable segments and are managed separately at the corporate level. These operating expenses include costs for share-based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resource, and RD&E functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. In addition, Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment.\nThe results for each reportable segment are discussed below.\nSemiconductor Systems Segment\nThe Semiconductor Systems segment is comprised primarily of capital equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips. Semiconductor industry spending on capital equipment is driven by demand for advanced electronic products, including smartphones and other mobile devices, servers, personal computers, automotive electronics, storage, and other products, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes, and as a result is subject to variable industry conditions. Development efforts are focused on solving customers\u2019 key technical challenges in transistor, interconnect, patterning and packaging performance as devices scale to advanced technology nodes.\nSemiconductor equipment customers continued to make strategic investments in new technology transitions during fiscal 2020. Foundry and logic spending increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 led by customer investment in advanced foundry-logic nodes. Spending by memory customers increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, as the market began to recover from excess supply and inventory levels and customers invested in new technology development. Overall semiconductor systems revenue increased in fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year.\nCertain significant measures for the periods indicated were as follows:\nNet sales for Semiconductor Systems by end use application for the periods indicated were as follows:\nNet sales for fiscal 2020 increased, in absolute dollars, compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher spending from foundry, logic and other customers. Operating margin for fiscal 2020 increased compared to fiscal 2019, primarily reflecting higher net sales and favorable changes in customer and product mix and lower travel related spending due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, partially offset by increased RD&E expenses, higher freight costs, higher personnel costs due to additional headcount to provide manufacturing capacity and flexibility, and incremental employee compensation related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNet sales for fiscal 2019 decreased compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower spending from memory customers, partially offset by increased spending from foundry, logic and other customers. Operating margin for fiscal 2019 decreased compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting lower net sales, unfavorable changes in customer and product mix.\nIn fiscal 2020, two customers each accounted for more than 10 percent of this segment\u2019s total net sales.\nThere was no single region that accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the Semiconductor Systems segment for any of the past three fiscal years.\nApplied Global Services Segment\nThe Applied Global Services segment provides integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity, including spares, upgrades, services, certain remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor, display and solar products.\nDemand for Applied Global Services\u2019 service solutions are driven by Applied\u2019s large and growing installed base of manufacturing systems, and customers\u2019 needs to shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield, and optimize factory output and operating costs. Industry conditions that affect Applied Global Services\u2019 sales of spares and services are primarily characterized by increases in semiconductor manufacturers\u2019 wafer starts and continued strong utilization rates, growth of the installed base of equipment, growing service intensity of newer tools, and the company\u2019s ability to sell more comprehensive service agreements.\nCertain significant measures for the periods indicated were as follows:\nNet sales for fiscal 2020 increased compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher customer spending on comprehensive service agreements, semiconductor spares and legacy systems. Operating margin for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 decreased primarily due to an increase in headcount to support business growth, underutilization of headcount due to COVID-19 restrictions preventing travel to customer sites, higher freight costs and incremental employee compensation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In fiscal 2020, three customers each accounted for more than 10 percent of this segment\u2019s total net sales.\nNet sales increased slightly in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher customer spending for comprehensive service agreements and legacy systems, partially offset by lower customer spending on semiconductor spares. Operating income for fiscal 2019 remained flat compared to the prior year primarily due to higher net sales, offset by higher expenses related to an increase in headcount. Operating margin for fiscal 2019 decreased slightly compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increase in headcount to support revenue growth.\nThere was no single region that accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the Applied Global Services segment for any of the past three fiscal years.\nDisplay and Adjacent Markets Segment\nThe Display and Adjacent Markets segment encompasses products for manufacturing liquid crystal and OLED displays, and other display technologies for TVs, monitors, laptops, personal computers, electronic tablets, smart phones, and other consumer-oriented devices, equipment upgrades and flexible coating systems. The segment is focused on expanding its presence through technologically-differentiated equipment for manufacturing large-scale LCD TVs, OLEDs, low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), metal oxide, and touch panel sectors; and development of products that provide customers with improved performance and yields.\nDisplay industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for next generation mobile devices. Uneven spending patterns by customers in the Display and Adjacent Markets segment can cause significant fluctuations quarter-over-quarter, as well as year-over-year.\nCertain significant measures for the periods presented were as follows:\nNet sales for fiscal 2020 decreased compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower customer investments in display manufacturing equipment for TVs, partially offset by higher customer investments in display manufacturing equipment for mobile products. Operating margin for fiscal 2020 increased compared to fiscal 2019, reflecting favorable changes in customer and product mix and lower travel related spending due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. In fiscal 2020, four customers each accounted for at least 10 percent of this segment\u2019s net sales, and together they accounted for approximately 74 percent of this segment\u2019s total net sales, with one customer accounting for approximately 32 percent of net sales.\nNet sales for fiscal 2019 decreased compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower customer investments in mobile and TV display manufacturing equipment. Operating income and operating margin for fiscal 2019 decreased compared to fiscal 2018, reflecting lower net sales and unfavorable changes in customer and product mix.\nThe following region accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the Display and Adjacent Markets segment for one or more of the periods presented:\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on Applied\u2019s consolidated financial statements, see Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nApplied\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following:\nSources and Uses of Cash\nA summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows:\nOperating Activities\nCash from operating activities for fiscal 2020 was $3.8 billion, which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of non-cash charges and changes in working capital components. Non-cash charges included depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and deferred income taxes. Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher net income and better cash collections. Cash provided from operating activities in fiscal 2019 decreased compared to fiscal 2018 due to lower net income, cash collections, change in income taxes payable and higher payments to suppliers, offset by a decrease in inventories.\nApplied has agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers. Applied sells its accounts receivable without recourse. Applied, from time to time, also discounts letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions. The discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. Applied sold $1.2 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion of accounts receivable during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Applied discounted letters of credit issued by customers of $105 million, $48 million and $37 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There was no discounting of promissory notes in each of fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nApplied\u2019s working capital was $8.9 billion at October 25, 2020 and $5.8 billion at October 27, 2019.\nDays sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was 57 days, 61 days, and 58 days, respectively. Days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and payment terms. The decrease in days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2020 was primarily due to higher accounts receivable factoring and favorable revenue linearity compared to the end of fiscal 2019. The increase in days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2019 compared to the end of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to lower factoring of accounts receivable.\nInvesting Activities\nApplied used $130 million and $443 million of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Applied generated $571 million in cash from investing activities in fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $422 million, $441 million and $622 million, respectively. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 were primarily for investments in demonstration and testing equipment, real property acquisitions and improvements, and network equipment. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 and 2018 were primarily for real property acquisitions and improvements in North America and Taiwan, as well as investments in demonstration, testing and laboratory tools. Proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchase of investments were $399 million, $26 million and $1.2 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Investing activities also included investments in technology to allow Applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies.\nApplied\u2019s investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, as well as equity securities. Applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies.\nFinancing Activities\nApplied used $1.3 billion of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2020, consisting primarily of the repayment of $1.4 billion senior notes, repurchases of common stock of $649 million, cash dividends to stockholders of $787 million and tax withholding payments for vested equity awards of $172 million, offset by net proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of $1.5 billion and proceeds from common stock issuances of $174 million.\nApplied used $3.1 billion of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2019, consisting primarily of repurchases of common stock of $2.4 billion, cash dividends to stockholders of $771 million and tax withholding payments for vested equity awards of $86 million, offset by proceeds from common stock issuances of $145 million.\nApplied used $5.9 billion of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2018, consisting primarily of repurchases of common stock of $5.3 billion, cash dividends to stockholders of $605 million and tax withholding payments for vested equity awards of $164 million, offset by proceeds from common stock issuances of $124 million.\nIn February 2018, the Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing up to an aggregate of $6.0 billion in repurchases. At October 25, 2020, $1.3 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase program.\nDuring fiscal 2020, Applied's Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share and three quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share. During fiscal 2019, Applied's Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share and three quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per share. During fiscal 2018, Applied\u2019s Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of 0.10 per share and three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.20 per share. Dividends paid during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $787 million, $771 million and $605 million, respectively. Applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Applied\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of Applied\u2019s stockholders.\nApplied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with a group of banks. Applied entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement in February 2020, which replaced Applied\u2019s prior $1.5 billion revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to expire in September 2021. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a provision under which Applied may request an increase in the amount of the facility of up to $500 million for a total commitment of no more than $2.0 billion, subject to the receipt of commitments from one or more lenders for any such increase and other customary conditions. The Revolving Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire in February 2025, unless extended as permitted under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for borrowings in United States dollars that bear interest for each advance at one of two rates selected by Applied, plus an applicable margin, which varies according to Applied\u2019s public debt credit ratings. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in compliance as of October 25, 2020.\nIn March 2020, Applied borrowed the full $1.5 billion available under the Revolving Credit Agreement in order to increase its cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. In May 2020, Applied repaid the full $1.5 billion of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Applied may at any time and from time to time, borrow, repay and reborrow under the Revolving Credit Agreement during the term of the facility. The interest rate for the March 2020 borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement was one-month LIBOR plus a margin of 0.875%, based on Applied\u2019s public debt credit ratings.\nRemaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $76 million are with Japanese banks. Applied\u2019s ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks\u2019 prime reference rate denominated in Japanese yen.\nIn August 2019, Applied entered into a term loan credit agreement with a group of lenders. Under the agreement, the lenders have committed to make an unsecured term loan to Applied of up to $2.0 billion to finance in part Applied\u2019s planned acquisition of all outstanding shares of Kokusai Electric, to pay related transaction fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. The commitments of the lenders to make the term loan will terminate if the transactions contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement are not consummated on or before December 30, 2020. The term loan, if advanced, will bear interest at one of two rates selected by Applied, plus an applicable margin, which varies according to Applied\u2019s public debt credit ratings, and must be repaid in full on the third anniversary of the funding date of the term loan.\nNo amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both October 25, 2020 and October 27, 2019.\nApplied has a short-term commercial paper program under which Applied may issue unsecured commercial paper notes of up to a total amount $1.5 billion. As of October 25, 2020, Applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding but may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future. The commercial paper program is backstopped by the Revolving Credit Agreement and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement reduce the amount of commercial paper notes Applied can issue.\nIn May 2020, Applied issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 1.750% senior unsecured notes due 2030 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.750% senior unsecured notes due 2050, in a registered public offering. In June 2020, Applied used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to redeem the outstanding $600 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2.625% senior unsecured notes due October 1, 2020 and $750 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.300% senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2021, at a total aggregate redemption price of $1.4 billion. As a result, Applied recognized a $33 million loss on early extinguishment of these senior unsecured notes.\nApplied had senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.5 billion outstanding as of October 25, 2020. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional discussion of existing debt. Applied may seek to refinance its existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness depending on Applied\u2019s capital requirements and the availability of financing.\nOthers\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The Tax Act requires a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. For fiscal 2018, Applied realized tax expense of $1.1 billion associated with the Tax Act, primarily due to the transition tax. The transition tax expense is payable in installments over eight years, with eight percent due in each of the first five years starting with fiscal 2018. As of October 25, 2020, Applied had $857 million of total payments remaining, payable in installments in the next six years. Before the Tax Act, U.S. income tax had not been provided for certain unrepatriated earnings that were considered indefinitely reinvested. Income tax is now provided for all unrepatriated earnings.\nAlthough cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, Applied\u2019s management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy Applied\u2019s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. For further details regarding Applied\u2019s operating, investing and financing activities, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this report.\nFor details on standby letters of credit, guarantee instruments and other agreements with banks, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements below.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either Applied or its subsidiaries. These include agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements. As of October 25, 2020, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $233 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements.\nApplied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. As of October 25, 2020, Applied has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately $153 million to cover these arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes Applied\u2019s contractual obligations as of October 25, 2020:\n______________________\n1Represents the transition tax liability associated with the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on December 22, 2017.\n2Represents Applied\u2019s agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of Applied\u2019s outstanding purchase orders for goods and services.\n3Other long-term liabilities in the table do not include pension, postretirement and deferred compensation plans due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments. Applied evaluates the need to make contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans after considering the funded status of the plans, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Payments to the plans would be dependent on these factors and could vary across a wide range of amounts and time periods. Payments for deferred compensation plans are dependent on activity by participants, making the timing of payments uncertain. Information on Applied\u2019s pension, postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans is presented in Note 14, Employee Benefit Plans, of the consolidated financial statements.\n4Applied\u2019s other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include deferred income tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and related gross interest and penalties. As of October 25, 2020, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits that was not expected to result in payment of cash within one year was $485 million. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions that were not expected to result in payment of cash within one year of October 25, 2020 was $74 million. At this time, Applied is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies.\nA critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of Applied\u2019s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on Applied\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. Specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) Applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates Applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on Applied\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nEstimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as Applied\u2019s operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. These uncertainties include those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that Applied\u2019s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and provide a meaningful presentation of Applied\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nManagement believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates:\nRevenue Recognition\nApplied recognizes revenue when promised goods or services (performance obligations) are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which Applied expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Applied performs the following five steps to determine when to recognize revenue: (1) identification of the contract(s) with customers, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied. Management uses judgment to identify performance obligations within a contract and to determine whether multiple promised goods or services in a contract should be accounted for separately or as a group. Judgment is also used in interpreting commercial terms and determining when transfer of control occurs. Moreover, judgment is used to estimate the contract\u2019s transaction price and allocate it to each performance obligation. Any material changes in the identification of performance obligations, determination and allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations, and determination of when transfer of control occurs to the customer, could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on Applied\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nWarranty Costs\nApplied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applied\u2019s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. As Applied\u2019s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs differ substantially from Applied\u2019s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applied\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nApplied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer-specific issues Applied has identified. Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer\u2019s ability to meet its financial obligation to Applied or its payment trends, may require Applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to Applied, which could have a material adverse effect on Applied\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applied\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nApplied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment. Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value.\nTo test goodwill for impairment, Applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, Applied then performs the two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. Under the two-step goodwill impairment test, Applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, Applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill. If Applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, Applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference.\nApplied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market approach. Applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Under the income approach, Applied estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow method.\nThe estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that Applied uses to manage its business, and considers any significant developments during the period. Under the discounted cash flow method, cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate, which considers the long-term earnings growth rate specific to the reporting units. The estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using each reporting unit\u2019s weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital measures a reporting unit\u2019s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a reporting unit\u2019s target capital structure. In addition, the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both known and estimated market metrics, and is adjusted to reflect both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows. The tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method is the median tax rate of comparable companies and reflects Applied\u2019s current international structure, which is consistent with the market participant perspective. Under the market approach, Applied uses the guideline company method which applies market multiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Applied uses market multiples that are consistent with comparable publicly-traded companies and considers each reporting unit\u2019s size, growth and profitability relative to its comparable companies.\nManagement uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment, especially in emerging markets. Indicators of potential impairment include, but are not limited to, challenging economic conditions, an unfavorable industry or economic environment or other severe decline in market conditions. Such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates used for the fair value calculation, resulting in an unexpected goodwill impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on Applied\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of goodwill impairment.\nIncome Taxes\nApplied\u2019s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pre-tax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates, conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives. It is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period, such as changes to income tax laws and the resolution of prior years\u2019 income tax filings.\nApplied recognizes a current tax liability for the estimated amount of income tax payable on tax returns for the current fiscal year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized.\nApplied recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are estimated based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Any changes in judgment related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in Applied\u2019s provision for income taxes in the quarter in which such change occurs. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in Applied\u2019s provision for income taxes.\nThe calculation of Applied\u2019s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with Applied\u2019s expectations could have an adverse material impact on Applied\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Financial Results\nManagement uses non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to evaluate the Company\u2019s operating and financial performance and for planning purposes, and as performance measures in its executive compensation program. Applied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of its performance and investors\u2019 ability to review the Company\u2019s business from the same perspective as the Company\u2019s management and facilitate comparisons of this period\u2019s results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of Applied's ongoing operating performance.\nThe non-GAAP adjusted financial measures presented below are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, including certain items related to mergers and acquisitions; restructuring charges and any associated adjustments; certain incremental expenses related to COVID-19; impairments of assets, or investments; gain or loss on sale of strategic investments; loss on early extinguishment of debt; certain income tax items and other discrete adjustments. Additionally, non-GAAP results exclude estimated discrete income tax expense items associated with U.S. tax legislation. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables presented below. There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and may exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted consolidated results for the past three fiscal years:\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nUNAUDITED RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP ADJUSTED RESULTS\n1 These items are incremental charges attributable to completed acquisitions, consisting of amortization of purchased intangible assets.\n2 Temporary incremental employee compensation during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n3 Charges to income tax provision related to a one-time transition tax as a result of U.S. tax legislation.\n4 Adjustment to provision for income taxes related to non-GAAP adjustments reflected in income before income taxes.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nUNAUDITED RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP ADJUSTED RESULTS\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted segment results for the past three fiscal years:\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nUNAUDITED RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP ADJUSTED RESULTS\n1 These items are incremental charges attributable to completed acquisitions, consisting of amortization of purchased intangible assets.\n2 Temporary incremental employee compensation during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNote: The reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted segment results above does not include certain revenues, costs of products sold and operating expenses that are reported within corporate and other and included in consolidated operating income.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nApplied is exposed to interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and debt issuances. Applied\u2019s investment portfolio includes fixed-income securities with a fair value of approximately $1.7 billion at October 25, 2020. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase. Based on Applied\u2019s investment portfolio at October 25, 2020, an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately $25 million. While an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio, Applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixed-income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other-than-temporary. At October 25, 2020, the aggregate principal of long-term senior unsecured notes issued by Applied was $5.5 billion with an estimated fair values of $6.6 billion. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of Applied\u2019s long-term debt issuances of approximately $798 million at October 25, 2020.\nCertain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign currencies, such as Japanese yen, Israeli shekel, euro and Taiwanese dollar. Applied enters into currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions generally expected to occur within the next 24 months. Gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized. Because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on currency forward exchange and option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged, these financial instruments are not expected to subject Applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.",

Based on that evaluation, Applied\u2019s management concluded that Applied\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 25, 2020.\nKPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K and, as part of the audit, has issued a report, included herein, on the effectiveness of Applied\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of October 25, 2020.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDue to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Applied continues to maintain workplace flexibility such as working remotely where possible to reduce the number of people who are on campus each day. Business continuity plans are in effect in order to mitigate potential impact on Applied\u2019s control environment and its operating and disclosure controls and procedures. The design of business continuity plans, which include remote access to secure data when needed, allow for remote and reliable execution of Applied\u2019s operating and disclosure controls and procedures.\nApplied evaluated the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on its internal control over financial reporting. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, there were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Applied\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIt should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events.",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 25, 2020 and October 27, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 25, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of October 25, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated December 11, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nChanges in Accounting Principles\nAs discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases as of October 28, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases. As discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory as of October 29, 2018 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16, Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of net realizable value adjustments to inventories for excess or obsolescence\nAs discussed in notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has inventories with a carrying value of $3,904 million as of October 25, 2020. The Company adjusts inventory carrying value for estimated excess or obsolescence equal to the difference between cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, there could be a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of inventories and results of operations.\nWe identified the evaluation of net realizable value adjustments to inventories for excess or obsolescence as a critical audit matter. Evaluation of the Company\u2019s estimates regarding forecasted sales and inventory consumption involved a high degree of auditor judgment.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s process for determining net realizable value adjustments for inventory excess or obsolescence, including controls related to estimating forecasted sales and inventory consumption. We evaluated certain inventories for excess or obsolescence by comparing the Company\u2019s sales and inventory consumption forecast to historical sales, historical inventory usage, known customer orders, and industry outlook reports. In addition, for certain inventories, we compared the Company\u2019s historical estimates of net realizable value adjustments for excess and obsolescence to the actual physical inventory disposals to evaluate the Company\u2019s ability to accurately estimate the net realizable value adjustments.\n/S/ KPMG LLP\nKPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2004.\nSanta Clara, California\nDecember 11, 2020\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nApplied Materials, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries\u2019 (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of October 25, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 25, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of October 25, 2020 and October 27, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 25, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated December 11, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nKPMG LLP\nSanta Clara, California\nDecember 11, 2020\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\n(In millions)\n(a) - Represents the reclassification adjustment related to the early adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-02 Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.\n(b) - Retained earnings balance as of October 29, 2017 and October 28, 2018 included increases of $281 million and $6 million, respectively, related to the adoption of the standard related to revenue recognition.\n(c) - Represents the adjustment related to the adoption of Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-01 Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities and ASU 2016-16 Income Tax (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNote 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Applied Materials, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Applied or the Company) after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. All references to a fiscal year apply to Applied\u2019s fiscal year which ends on the last Sunday in October. Fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 contained 52 weeks each. Each fiscal quarter of 2020, 2019 and 2018 contained 13 weeks.\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, Applied evaluates its estimates, including those related to standalone selling price (SSP) related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, inventories, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of share-based awards, and income taxes, among others. Applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nAs of October 25, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and worldwide response remains fluid. As a result, many of Applied\u2019s estimates and assumptions are subject to increased judgment and volatility. These estimates may differ materially in future periods as the pandemic continues to evolve and additional information becomes available.\nCash Equivalents\nAll highly-liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of investments in institutional money market funds.\nInvestments\nAll of Applied\u2019s investments, except equity investments held in privately-held companies, are classified as available-for-sale at the respective balance sheet dates. Investments classified as available-for-sale are measured and recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interest earned on cash and investments, as well as realized gains and losses on sale of securities, are included in interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at cost, less impairment, adjusted by observable price changes. Adjustments resulting from impairments and observable prices changes will be recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nApplied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer-specific issues Applied has identified. Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer\u2019s ability to meet its financial obligation to Applied or its payment trends, may require Applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to Applied. Bad debt expense and any reversals are recorded in marketing and selling expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Applied adjusts inventory carrying value for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Applied fully writes down inventories and noncancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. Applied performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by Applied, additional inventory adjustments may be required.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives for financial reporting purposes are as follows: buildings and improvements, 3 to 30 years; demonstration and manufacturing equipment, 3 to 5 years; software, 3 to 5 years; and furniture, fixtures and other equipment, 3 to 5 years. Land improvements are amortized over the shorter of 15 years or the estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of five years or the lease term.\nIntangible Assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Purchased technology and other intangible assets are presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 15 years using the straight-line method.\nLong-Lived Assets\nApplied reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Applied assesses these assets for impairment based on estimated future cash flows from these assets.\nRevenue Recognition from Contracts with Customers\nApplied recognizes revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which Applied expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Applied determines revenue recognition through the following five steps; (1) identification of the contract(s) with customers, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied.\nIdentifying the contract(s) with customers. Applied sells manufacturing equipment, services, and spare parts directly to its customers in the semiconductor, display, and related industries. The Company generally considers written documentation including, but not limited to, signed purchase orders, master agreements, and sales orders as contracts provided that collection is probable. Collectability is assessed based on the customer\u2019s creditworthiness determined by reviewing the customer\u2019s published credit and financial information, historical payment experience, as well as other relevant factors.\nIdentifying the performance obligations. Applied\u2019s performance obligations include delivery of manufacturing equipment, service agreements, spare parts, installation, extended warranty and training. Applied\u2019s service agreements are considered one performance obligation and may include multiple goods and services that Applied provides to the customer to deliver against a performance metric. Judgment is used to determine whether multiple promised goods or services in a contract should be accounted for separately or as a group.\nDetermine the transaction price. The transaction price for Applied\u2019s contracts with customers may include fixed and variable consideration. Applied includes variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.\nAllocate the transaction price to the performance obligations. A contract\u2019s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation identified within the contract. Applied generally estimates the standalone selling price of a distinct performance obligation based on historical cost plus an appropriate margin. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, Applied allocates the contract\u2019s transaction price to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.\nRecognizing the revenue as performance obligations are satisfied. Applied recognizes revenue from equipment and spares parts at a point in time when Applied has satisfied its performance obligation by transferring control of the goods to the customer which typically occurs at shipment or delivery. Revenue from service agreements is recognized over time, typically within 12 months, as customers receive the benefits of services.\nThe incremental costs to obtain a contract are not material.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nPayment Terms. Payment terms vary by contract. Generally, the majority of payments are due within a certain number of days from shipment of goods or performance of service. The remainder is typically due upon customer technical acceptance. Applied typically receives deposits on future deliverables from customers in the Display and Adjacent Markets segment and, in certain instances, may also receive deposits from customers in the Applied Global Services segment. Applied\u2019s payment terms do not generally contain a significant financing component.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nApplied accounts for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill our promise to transfer the associated products. Accordingly, amounts billed for shipping and handling costs are recorded as a component of net sales and costs as a component of cost of products sold.\nWarranty\nApplied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applied\u2019s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. If actual warranty costs differ substantially from Applied\u2019s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.\nApplied also sells extended warranty contracts to its customers which provide an extension of the standard warranty coverage period of up to 2 years. Applied receives payment at the inception of the contract and recognizes revenue ratably over the extended warranty coverage period, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the extended warranty.\nSales and Value Added Taxes\nTaxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nResearch, Development and Engineering Costs\nResearch, development and engineering costs are expensed as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nApplied recognizes a current tax liability for the estimated amount of income tax payable on tax returns for the current fiscal year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryovers. Deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized.\nApplied recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are estimated based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Any changes in judgment related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in Applied\u2019s provision for income taxes in the quarter in which such change occurs. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in Applied\u2019s provision for income taxes.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nApplied uses financial instruments, such as forward exchange and currency option contracts, to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions typically expected to occur within 24 months. The purpose of Applied\u2019s foreign currency management is to mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. In certain cases, Applied also uses interest rate swap or lock agreements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt. The terms of derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes are generally consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged. All of Applied\u2019s derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices for comparable instruments. For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders\u2019 equity, and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If the transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if a portion of any derivative is ineffective, the gain or loss on the associated financial instrument is recorded promptly in earnings. For derivative instruments used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, the gain or loss on these hedges is recorded promptly in earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nForeign Currencies\nAs of October 25, 2020, all of Applied\u2019s subsidiaries use the United States dollar as their functional currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are remeasured using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, except for non-monetary assets, such as inventories and property, plant and equipment, which are remeasured using historical exchange rates. Foreign currency-denominated revenues and costs are remeasured using average exchange rates for the period, except for costs related to those balance sheet items that are remeasured using historical exchange rates. The resulting remeasurement gains and losses are included in interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as incurred.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject Applied to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, investments, trade accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities. Applied invests in a variety of financial instruments, such as, but not limited to, commercial paper, corporate and municipal bonds, United States Treasury and agency securities, and asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. Applied is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments, but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. Applied performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers\u2019 financial condition and generally requires no collateral to secure accounts receivable. Applied maintains an allowance reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based on its assessment of the collectability of accounts receivable. Applied regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable balances, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer\u2019s ability to pay. In addition, Applied utilizes deposits and/or letters of credit to mitigate credit risk when considered appropriate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Standards Adopted\nLeases. In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance for lease accounting, which requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for certain lease arrangements that are classified as operating leases under the previous standard, and to provide for enhanced disclosures. Applied adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 using the modified retrospective transition method which required applying the new standard as of the beginning of the period of adoption with no adjustment to comparative prior periods. Applied elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allow Applied not to reassess whether a contract contains a lease, initial direct costs and lease classification for leases existing prior to adoption. Applied also elected to combine the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component and not to use hindsight in determining the lease term. Upon adoption, Applied recognized right-of-use assets of $160 million, net of deferred rent of $4 million and lease liabilities of $164 million.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDerivatives and Hedging. In August 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that modifies the recognition and presentation of hedge accounting to better align an entity\u2019s risk management strategies and financial reporting for hedging relationships. The authoritative guidance expands the application of hedge accounting for non-financial and financial risk components and eases certain hedge effectiveness assessment requirements. Applied adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 under the modified retrospective approach. The cumulative effect adjustment for the elimination of the ineffectiveness was not material to Applied\u2019s consolidated financial statements. The presentation and disclosure have been amended on a prospective basis, as required by this update.\nReceivables: Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs. In March 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that will shorten the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium to the earliest call date to more closely align with expectations incorporated in market pricing. Applied adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on Applied\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes: In December 2019, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to simplify the accounting for income taxes (Topic 740). This amendment removes certain exceptions and improves consistent application of accounting principles for certain areas in Topic 740. This authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, with early adoption permitted. Applied is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on Applied\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nRetirement Benefits: Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit and other Postretirement Plans. In August 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that adds, removes, and clarifies disclosure requirements for defined benefit and other postretirement plans. This authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2021 on a retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on Applied's defined benefit and other postretirement disclosures.\nGoodwill Impairment. In January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that simplifies the process required to test goodwill for impairment. The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on Applied\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nFinancial Instruments: Credit Losses. In June 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that modifies the impairment model for certain financial assets by requiring use of an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on Applied\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNote 2 Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is determined using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is determined using the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares (representing the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase plan shares) outstanding during the period. Applied\u2019s net income has not been adjusted for any period presented for purposes of computing basic or diluted earnings per share due to the Company\u2019s non-complex capital structure.\nPotentially dilutive securities attributable to outstanding stock options and restricted stock units are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share where the combined exercise price and average unamortized fair value are greater than the average market price of Applied common stock, and therefore their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNote 3 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\nSummary of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\nThe following tables summarize Applied\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and investments by security type:\n_________________________\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n________________________\n* Includes agency debt securities guaranteed by Canada.\nMaturities of Investments\nThe following table summarizes the contractual maturities of Applied\u2019s investments at October 25, 2020:\n_________________________\n** Securities with no single maturity date include publicly-traded and privately-held equity securities, and asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nGains and Losses on Investments\nGross realized gains and losses on sales of investments for each fiscal year were as follows:\nAt October 25, 2020, gross unrealized losses related to Applied\u2019s debt investment portfolio were not material. Applied regularly reviews its debt investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether an unrealized loss is considered to be temporary, or other-than-temporary and therefore impaired, include: the length of time and extent to which fair value has been lower than the cost basis; the financial condition, credit quality and near-term prospects of the investee; and whether it is more likely than not that Applied will be required to sell the security prior to recovery.\nApplied determined that the gross unrealized losses on its marketable fixed-income securities at October 25, 2020, October 27, 2019 and October 28, 2018 were temporary in nature and therefore it did not recognize any impairment of its marketable fixed-income securities for fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018. During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, impairment charge on equity investments in privately-held companies were not material. These impairment charges are included in interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nUnrealized gains and losses on investments classified as equity investments are recognized in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01 Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, these unrealized gains and temporary losses were included within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of any related tax effect.\nThe components of gain (loss) on equity investments for each fiscal year were as follows:\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNote 4 Fair Value Measurements\nApplied\u2019s financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity investments in privately-held companies. These equity investments are generally accounted for under the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred. Applied\u2019s nonfinancial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at cost and are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nApplied uses the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\n\u2022Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n\u2022Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and\n\u2022Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nApplied\u2019s investments consist primarily of debt securities that are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at their fair values. In determining the fair value of investments, Applied uses pricing information from pricing services that value securities based on quoted market prices and models that utilize observable market inputs. In the event a fair value estimate is unavailable from a pricing service, Applied generally obtains non-binding price quotes from brokers. Applied then reviews the information provided by the pricing services or brokers to determine the fair value of its short-term and long-term investments. In addition, to validate pricing information obtained from pricing services, Applied periodically performs supplemental analysis on a sample of securities. Applied reviews any significant unanticipated differences identified through this analysis to determine the appropriate fair value. As of October 25, 2020, substantially all of Applied\u2019s available-for-sale, short-term and long-term investments were recognized at fair value that was determined based upon observable inputs.\nApplied\u2019s equity investments with readily determinable values consist of publicly traded equity securities. These investments are measured at fair value using quoted prices for identical assets in an active market and the changes in fair value of these equity investments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\nInvestments with remaining effective maturities of 12 months or less from the balance sheet date are classified as short-term investments. Investments with remaining effective maturities of more than 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nFinancial assets (excluding cash balances) measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:\n_________________________\n* Amount as of October 25, 2020 includes $115 million invested in money market funds related to deferred compensation plans. Due to restrictions on the distribution of these funds, they are classified as restricted cash equivalents and are included in deferred income taxes and other assets in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.\nApplied did not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis within Level 3 fair value measurements as of October 25, 2020 or October 27, 2019.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis\nApplied\u2019s equity investments without readily determinable values consist of equity investments in privately-held companies. Applied elected the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes on a prospective basis for certain equity investments without readily determinable fair values and is required to account for any subsequent observable changes in fair value within the statements of operations. These investments are periodically assessed for impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that a decline in value may have occurred.\nDuring fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, impairment charges on equity investments in privately-held companies were not material.\nOther\nThe carrying amounts of Applied\u2019s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable - short term, and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate fair value due to their short maturities. At October 25, 2020, the aggregate principal amount of long-term senior unsecured notes was $5.5 billion, and estimated fair value was $6.6 billion. At October 27, 2019, the aggregate principal and estimated fair value amounts of long-term senior unsecured notes were both $4.8 billion and estimated fair value was $5.5 billion. The estimated fair value of long-term senior unsecured notes is determined by Level 2 inputs and is based primarily on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of existing debt.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNote 5 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nApplied conducts business in a number of foreign countries, with certain transactions denominated in local currencies, such as the Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Taiwanese dollar. Applied uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward exchange contracts and currency option contracts, to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur typically within the next 24 months. The purpose of Applied\u2019s foreign currency management is to mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. The terms of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are generally consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged.\nApplied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative instruments and hedging activities, including foreign currency exchange and interest rate contracts, are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment, as well as the ineffective portion of any hedges, are recognized currently in earnings. All of Applied\u2019s derivative financial instruments are recorded at their fair value in other current assets or in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nHedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of the hedge as cash flow hedges and foreign exchange derivatives are typically entered into once per month. Cash flow hedges are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly. The effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of AOCI in stockholders\u2019 equity and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. The majority of the after-tax net income or loss related to foreign exchange derivative instruments included in AOCI at October 25, 2020 is expected to be reclassified into earnings within 12 months. Prior to adopting the new accounting guidance for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of currency forward exchange and option contracts due to changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of effectiveness. Subsequent to the adoption of the new accounting guidance, only changes in the fair value of option contracts due to changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of effectiveness. The initial value of this excluded component is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in the financial statement line item to which the hedge relates. Both ineffective hedge amounts and hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings. If the transaction being hedged is no longer probable to occur, or if a portion of any derivative is deemed to be ineffective, Applied promptly recognizes the gain or loss on the associated financial instrument in the statement of operations. The amount recognized due to discontinuance of cash flow hedges that were probable not to occur by the end of the originally specified time period were not significant for fiscal years 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nAdditionally, forward exchange contracts are generally used to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. These derivatives are typically entered into once per month and are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these hedges are recorded in earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.\nThe fair values of foreign exchange derivative instruments at October 25, 2020 and October 27, 2019 were not material.\nApplied is also exposed to interest rate risk associated with its potential future borrowings. During fiscal 2020, Applied entered into a series of interest rate contracts to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt. These instruments were designated as cash flow hedges at inception and were settled in conjunction with the issuance of debt in May 2020.\nThe gain (loss) on derivatives in cash flow hedging relationships recognized in AOCI for derivatives designated as hedging instruments for the indicated periods were as follows:\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe effects of derivative instruments and hedging activities on the Consolidated Statements of Operations were as follows:\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nCredit Risk Contingent Features\nIf Applied\u2019s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, it would be in violation of credit risk contingent provisions of the derivative instruments discussed above, and certain counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that were in a net liability position was immaterial as of October 25, 2020 and October 27, 2019.\nEntering into derivative contracts with banks exposes Applied to credit-related losses in the event of the banks\u2019 nonperformance. However, Applied\u2019s exposure is not considered significant.\nNote 6 Accounts Receivable, Net\nApplied has agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers. Applied sells its accounts receivable without recourse. Applied, from time to time, also discounts letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions. The discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements.\nApplied sold $1.2 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion of accounts receivable during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Applied discounted letters of credit issued by customers of $105 million, $48 million and $37 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There was no discounting of promissory notes in each of fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018. Financing charges on the sale of receivables and discounting of letters of credit are included in interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and were not material for all years presented.\nAccounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $30 million at October 25, 2020 and October 27, 2019. Changes in allowance for doubtful accounts in each fiscal year were as follows:\n_____________________________\n1 Deductions primarily represent releases of allowance for doubtful accounts credited to expense as a result of an overall lower risk profile of Applied\u2019s customers and cash collections.\nApplied sells its products principally to manufacturers within the semiconductor and display industries. While Applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate and represents its best estimate as of October 25, 2020, it continues to closely monitor customer liquidity and industry and economic conditions, which may result in changes to Applied\u2019s estimates.\nNote 7 Contract Balances\nContract assets primarily result from receivables for goods transferred to customers where payment is conditional upon technical sign off and not just the passage of time. Contract liabilities consist of unsatisfied performance obligations related to advance payments received and billings in excess of revenue recognized. Applied\u2019s contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\nContract assets are generally classified as current and included in Other Current Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract liabilities are classified as current or non-current based on the timing of when performance obligations will be satisfied and associated revenue is expected to be recognized.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nContract balances at the end of each reporting period were as follows:\nThe increase in contract assets during fiscal 2020, was primarily due to goods transferred to customers where payment was conditional upon technical sign off, offset by the reclassification of contract assets to net accounts receivable upon meeting conditions to the right to payment.\nDuring fiscal 2020, Applied recognized revenue of approximately $1.1 billion related to contract liabilities at October 27, 2019. This reduction in contract liabilities was offset by new billings for products and services for which there were unsatisfied performance obligations to customers and revenue had not yet been recognized as of October 25, 2020.\nThere were no impairment losses recognized on Applied\u2019s accounts receivables and contract assets during fiscal 2020 and 2019.\nAs of October 25, 2020, the amount of remaining unsatisfied performance obligations on contracts with an original estimated duration of one year or more was approximately $1.1 billion, of which approximately 70% is expected to be recognized within 12 months and the remainder is expected to be recognized within the following 24 months thereafter. Applied has elected the available practical expedient to exclude the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.\nNote 8 Balance Sheet Detail\nIncluded in finished goods inventory is $16 million at October 25, 2020 and $13 million at October 27, 2019, of newly-introduced systems at customer locations where the sales transaction did not meet Applied\u2019s revenue recognition criteria as set forth in Note 1. Finished goods inventory includes $416 million and $318 million of evaluation inventory at October 25, 2020 and October 27, 2019, respectively.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDepreciation expense was $320 million, $306 million and $258 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNote 9 Business Combinations\nKokusai Electric Corporation\nOn June 30, 2019, Applied entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) to acquire all outstanding shares of Kokusai Electric Corporation (Kokusai Electric) for $2.2 billion in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. Kokusai Electric is a leading company in providing high-productivity batch processing systems and services for memory, foundry and logic customers. These systems complement Applied\u2019s portfolio of single-wafer processing systems. Following the close of the transaction, Kokusai Electric will operate as a business unit of Applied\u2019s Semiconductor Systems segment and continue to be based in Tokyo, with technology and manufacturing centers in Toyama, Japan and Cheonan, Korea. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The SPA contains certain termination rights, including if the transactions contemplated by the SPA are not consummated on or before June 30, 2020 (Outside Date), which date may be extended by three months on two separate occasions if, on the applicable date, the only conditions to closing relate to required regulatory approvals. Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, the parties mutually extended the Outside Date to September 30, 2020, and on September 30, 2020 mutually further extended the Outside Date to December 30, 2020.\nNote 10 Goodwill, Purchased Technology and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets\nApplied\u2019s methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established and generally accepted valuation techniques. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed. Applied assigns assets acquired (including goodwill) and liabilities assumed to one or more reporting units as of the date of acquisition. Typically, acquisitions relate to a single reporting unit and thus do not require the allocation of goodwill to multiple reporting units. If the products obtained in an acquisition are assigned to multiple reporting units, the goodwill is distributed to the respective reporting units as part of the purchase price allocation process.\nGoodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant judgment, especially in emerging markets. Applied regularly monitors current business conditions and considers other factors including, but not limited to, adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions and lower projections of profitability that may impact future operating results.\nTo test goodwill for impairment, Applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, Applied then performs the two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. Under the two-step goodwill impairment test, Applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Applied determines the fair value of each of its reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, Applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill. If Applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, Applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference.\nAs of October 25, 2020, Applied\u2019s reporting units include Semiconductor Products Group and Imaging and Process Control Group, which combine to form the Semiconductor Systems reporting segment, Applied Global Services, Display and Adjacent Markets and other reporting units recorded under Corporate and Other.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Applied performed a qualitative assessment to test goodwill for all of its reporting units for impairment. Applied determined that it was more likely than not that each of its reporting units\u2019 fair values exceeded their respective carrying values and that it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of its reporting units.\nThe evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment. In the event of future changes in business conditions, Applied will be required to reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses. If the results of these future analyses are lower than current estimates, a material impairment charge may result at that time.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDetails of goodwill were as follows:\nDuring fiscal 2020, the increase in goodwill was primarily due to the preliminary purchase accounting for acquisitions completed in fiscal 2020, which were not material to Applied\u2019s results of operations.\nA summary of Applied\u2019s purchased technology and intangible assets is set forth below:\nFinite-Lived Purchased Intangible Assets\nApplied amortizes purchased intangible assets with finite lives using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from 1 to 15 years.\nApplied evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable. Applied assesses the fair value of the assets based on the amount of the undiscounted future cash flow that the assets are expected to generate and recognizes an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset, plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. When Applied identifies an impairment, Applied reduces the carrying value of the group of assets to comparable market values, when available and appropriate, or to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach.\nIntangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. Applied evaluates the useful lives of its intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances require revising the remaining period of amortization. In addition, Applied reviews intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Management considers such indicators as significant differences in actual product acceptance from the estimates, changes in the competitive and economic environments, technological advances, and changes in cost structure.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDetails of finite-lived intangible assets were as follows:\nDetails of amortization expense for each fiscal year by segment were as follows:\nAmortization expense for each fiscal year was charged to the following categories:\nAs of October 25, 2020, future estimated amortization expense is expected to be as follows:\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNote 11 Borrowing Facilities and Debt\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nIn February 2020, Applied entered into a five-year $1.5 billion committed unsecured revolving credit agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with a group of banks. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a provision under which Applied may request an increase in the amount of the facility of up to $500 million for a total commitment of no more than $2.0 billion, subject to the receipt of commitments from one or more lenders for any such increase and other customary conditions. The Revolving Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire in February 2025, unless extended as permitted under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement replaced Applied\u2019s prior $1.5 billion credit agreement that was scheduled to expire in September 2021. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for borrowings that bear interest for each advance at one of two rates selected by Applied, plus an applicable margin, which varies according to Applied\u2019s public debt credit ratings.\nIn March 2020, Applied borrowed the full $1.5 billion available under the Revolving Credit Agreement in order to increase its cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. In May 2020, Applied repaid the full $1.5 billion of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Applied may at any time and from time to time, borrow, repay and reborrow under the Revolving Credit Agreement during the term of the facility. The interest rate for the March 2020 borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement was one-month LIBOR plus a margin of 0.875%, based on Applied\u2019s public debt credit ratings.\nNo amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of October 25, 2020 and October 27, 2019.\nIn addition, Applied has revolving credit facilities with Japanese banks pursuant to which it may borrow up to approximately $76 million in aggregate at any time. Applied\u2019s ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks\u2019 prime reference rate denominated in Japanese yen. As of October 25, 2020 and October 27, 2019, no amounts were outstanding under these revolving credit facilities.\nTerm Loan and Short-term Commercial Paper\nIn August 2019, Applied entered into a term loan credit agreement with a group of lenders. Under the agreement, the lenders have committed to make an unsecured term loan to Applied of up to $2.0 billion to finance in part Applied\u2019s planned acquisition of all outstanding shares of Kokusai Electric, to pay related transaction fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. The commitments of the lenders to make the term loan will terminate if the transactions contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement are not consummated on or before December 30, 2020. The term loan, if advanced, will bear interest at one of two rates selected by Applied, plus an applicable margin, which varies according to Applied\u2019s public debt credit ratings, and must be repaid in full on the third anniversary of the funding date of the term loan. No amounts were outstanding under this term loan credit agreement at both October 25, 2020 and October 27, 2019.\nApplied has a short-term commercial paper program under which Applied may issue unsecured commercial paper notes of up to a total amount of $1.5 billion. At October 25, 2020 and October 27, 2019, Applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nIn May 2020, Applied issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 1.750% senior unsecured notes due 2030 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.750% senior unsecured notes due 2050, in a registered public offering. In June 2020, Applied used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to redeem the outstanding $600 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2.625% senior unsecured notes due October 1, 2020 and $750 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.300% senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2021, at a total aggregate redemption price of $1.4 billion. As a result, Applied recognized a $33 million loss on early extinguishment of these senior unsecured notes.\nDebt outstanding as of October 25, 2020 and October 27, 2019 was as follows:\nNote 12 Leases\nA contract contains a lease when Applied has the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Applied leases certain facilities, vehicles and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, many of which include options to renew. Options that are reasonably certain to be exercised are included in the calculation of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Applied\u2019s leases do not contain residual value guarantees or significant restrictions that impact the accounting for leases. As implicit rates are not available for the leases, Applied uses the incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date in order to measure the right-of-use asset and liability. Operating lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nApplied elected the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all leases. For leases with a term of one year or less, Applied elected not to record a right-of-use asset or lease liability and to account for the associated lease payments as they become due.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe components of lease expense and supplemental information were as follows:\nTotal rent expense for fiscal 2019 and 2018, was $51 million and $50 million, respectively.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases are as follows:\nAs of October 25, 2020, the maturities of lease liabilities are as follows:\nPrior to the adoption of the new lease standard, future minimum lease payments as of October 27, 2019, as defined under the previous lease accounting guidance, were as follows:\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNote 13 Stockholders\u2019 Equity, Comprehensive Income and Share-Based Compensation\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nChanges in the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of tax, were as follows:\n(a) - Represents the reclassification adjustment related to the early adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-02 Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.\n(b) - Represents the reclassification adjustment related to the adoption of Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-01 Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\nThe tax effects on the unrealized loss on derivative instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges for fiscal 2020 was $33 million. The tax effects on net income of amounts reclassified from AOCI for the fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were not material.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nStock Repurchase Programs\nIn February 2018, the Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing up to an aggregate of $6.0 billion in repurchases. At October 25, 2020, $1.3 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase program.\nThe following table summarizes Applied\u2019s stock repurchases for each fiscal year:\nApplied records treasury stock purchases under the cost method using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Upon reissuance of treasury stock, amounts in excess of the acquisition cost are credited to additional paid in capital. If Applied reissues treasury stock at an amount below its acquisition cost and additional paid in capital associated with prior treasury stock transactions is insufficient to cover the difference between the acquisition cost and the reissue price, this difference is recorded against retained earnings.\nDividends\nDuring fiscal 2020, Applied's Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share and three quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share. During fiscal 2019, Applied's Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share and three quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per share. During fiscal 2018, Applied\u2019s Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of 0.10 per share and three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.20 per share. Dividends paid during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $787 million, $771 million and $605 million, respectively. Applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Applied\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of Applied\u2019s stockholders.\nShare-Based Compensation\nApplied has a stockholder-approved equity plan, the Employee Stock Incentive Plan, which permits grants to employees of share-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units. In addition, the plan provides for the automatic grant of restricted stock units to non-employee directors and permits the grant of share-based awards to non-employee directors and consultants. Share-based awards made under the plan may be subject to accelerated vesting under certain circumstances in the event of a change in control of Applied. Applied also has two Employee Stock Purchase Plans, one generally for United States employees and a second for employees of international subsidiaries (collectively, ESPP), which enable eligible employees to purchase Applied common stock.\nApplied recognized share-based compensation expense related to equity awards and ESPP shares. The effect of share-based compensation on the results of operations and the related tax benefits for each fiscal year were as follows:\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nShare-based expense in fiscal 2020 increased compared to the prior years primarily due to expense related to awards with provisions that became effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 that allow partial accelerated vesting in the event of a qualifying retirement.\nThe cost associated with share-based awards that are subject solely to time-based vesting requirements, less expected forfeitures, is recognized over the awards\u2019 service period for the entire award on a straight-line basis. Share-based awards granted to certain executive officers allow partial accelerated vesting in the event of a qualifying retirement based on age and years of service. The cost associated with performance-based equity awards, which include both performance and market goals, is recognized for each tranche over the service period. The cost of equity awards related to performance goals is based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved. For the equity awards based on market goals, the cost is recognized based upon the assumption of 100% achievement of the goal.\nAt October 25, 2020, Applied had $425 million in total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to grants of share-based awards and shares issued under Applied\u2019s ESPP, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.4 years. At October 25, 2020, there were 56 million shares available for grants of share-based awards under the Employee Stock Incentive Plan, and an additional 10 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP.\nStock Options\nStock options are rights to purchase, at future dates, shares of Applied common stock. The exercise price of each stock option equals the fair market value of Applied common stock on the date of grant. Options typically vest over three to four years, subject to the grantee\u2019s continued service with Applied through the scheduled vesting date, and expire no later than seven years from the grant date. There were no stock options granted during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018. There were no outstanding stock options at the end of fiscal 2020.\nRestricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock, Performance Shares and Performance Units\nRestricted stock units are converted into shares of Applied common stock upon vesting on a one-for-one basis. Restricted stock has the same rights as other issued and outstanding shares of Applied common stock except these shares generally have no right to dividends and are held in escrow until the award vests. Performance shares and performance units are awards that result in a payment to a grantee, generally in shares of Applied common stock on a one-for-one basis, if performance goals and/or other vesting criteria established by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of Applied\u2019s Board of Directors are achieved or the awards otherwise vest. Restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance shares and performance units typically vest over three to four years and vesting is usually subject to the grantee\u2019s continued service with Applied and, in some cases, achievement of specified performance goals. The compensation expense related to the service-based awards is determined using the fair market value of Applied common stock on the date of the grant, and the compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period.\nDuring fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, certain executive officers were granted awards that are subject to the achievement of specified performance goals (performance-based awards).\nPerformance-based awards granted in fiscal 2018\nCertain awards require the achievement of positive adjusted operating profit and vest ratably over three years. Other awards require the achievement of targeted levels of adjusted operating profit margin and wafer fabrication equipment market share, and the number of shares that may vest in full after three years ranges from 0% to 200% of the target amount.\nThe fair value of these awards is estimated on the date of grant. If the performance goals are achieved as of the end of the performance period, the awards will vest, provided that the grantee remains employed by Applied through each applicable vesting date. If the performance goals are not achieved, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. The expected cost is based on the awards that are probable to vest and is reflected over the service period and reduced for estimated forfeitures.\nPerformance-based awards granted in fiscal 2019 and 2020\nCertain awards are subject to the achievement of targeted levels of adjusted operating margin and total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a peer group, comprised of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. Each metric will be weighted 50% and will be measured over a three-year period. The number of shares that may vest in full after three years ranges from 0% to 200% of the target amount. The awards become eligible to vest only if performance goals are achieved and will vest only if the grantee remains employed by Applied through each applicable vesting date, subject to a qualifying retirement based on age and years of service. The awards provide for a partial payout based on actual performance at the conclusion of the three-year performance period in the event of a qualifying retirement.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe fair value of the portion of the awards subject to targeted levels of adjusted operating margin is estimated on the date of grant. If the performance goals are not achieved as of the end of the performance period, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. The expected cost is based on the awards that are probable to vest and is reflected over the service period and reduced for estimated forfeitures.\nThe fair value of the portion of the awards subject to targeted levels of TSR is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense is recognized based upon the assumption of 100% achievement of the TSR goal and will not be reversed even if the threshold level of TSR is never achieved, and is reflected over the service period and reduced for estimated forfeitures.\nA summary of the changes in restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance shares and performance units outstanding under Applied\u2019s equity compensation plans is presented below:\nAt October 25, 2020, 1.2 million additional performance-based awards could be earned based upon achievement of certain levels of specified performance goals.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plans\nUnder the ESPP, substantially all employees may purchase Applied common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85 percent of the lower of the fair market value of Applied common stock at the beginning or end of each 6-month purchase period, subject to certain limits. Applied issued 3 million shares in each of fiscal 2020, 4 million shares in fiscal 2019 and 3 million shares in fiscal 2018, under the ESPP. Compensation expense is calculated using the fair value of the employees\u2019 purchase rights under the Black-Scholes model. Underlying assumptions used in the model are outlined in the following table:\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNote 14 Employee Benefit Plans\nEmployee Bonus Plans\nApplied has various employee bonus plans. A discretionary bonus plan provides for the distribution of a percentage of pre-tax income to Applied employees who are not participants in other performance-based incentive plans, up to a maximum percentage of eligible compensation. Other plans provide for bonuses to Applied\u2019s executives and other key contributors based on the achievement of profitability and/or other specified performance criteria. Charges under these plans for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $471 million, $292 million and $382 million, respectively.\nEmployee Savings and Retirement Plan\nApplied\u2019s Employee Savings and Retirement Plan (the 401(k) Plan) is qualified under Sections 401(a) and (k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). Eligible employees may make salary deferral and catch-up contributions under the 401(k) Plan on a pre-tax basis and on a Roth basis, subject to an annual dollar limit established by the Code. Applied matches 100% of participant salary and/or Roth deferral contributions up to the first 3% of eligible contribution and then 50% of every dollar between 4% and 6% of eligible contribution. Applied does not make matching contributions on any catch-up contributions made by participants. Plan participants who were employed by Applied or any of its affiliates became 100% vested in their Applied matching contribution account balances. Applied\u2019s matching contributions under the 401(k) Plan were approximately $52 million for fiscal 2020, $49 million for fiscal 2019 and $45 million for fiscal 2018.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans of Foreign Subsidiaries and Other Postretirement Benefits\nSeveral of Applied\u2019s foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their eligible employees. Benefits under these plans are typically based on years of service and final average compensation levels. The plans are managed in accordance with applicable local statutes and practices. Applied deposits funds for certain of these plans with insurance companies, pension trustees, government-managed accounts, and/or accrues the expense for the unfunded portion of the benefit obligation on its Consolidated Financial Statements. Applied\u2019s practice is to fund the various pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements as established by applicable local governmental oversight and taxing authorities. Depending on the design of the plan, local custom and market circumstances, the liabilities of a plan may exceed the qualified plan assets. The differences between the aggregate projected benefit obligations and aggregate plan assets of these plans have been recorded as liabilities by Applied and are included in other liabilities and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nA summary of the changes in benefit obligations and plan assets, which includes post-retirement benefits, for each fiscal year is presented below:\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following table presents a summary of the ending fair value of the plan assets:\nThe following table presents the activity in Level 3 instruments for each fiscal year:\nApplied\u2019s investment strategy for its defined benefit plans is to invest plan assets in a prudent manner, maintaining well-diversified portfolios with the long-term objective of meeting the obligations of the plans as they come due. Asset allocation decisions are typically made by plan fiduciaries with input from Applied\u2019s international pension committee. Applied\u2019s asset allocation strategy incorporates a sufficient equity exposure in order for the plans to benefit from the expected better long-term performance of equities relative to the plans\u2019 liabilities. Applied retains investment managers, where appropriate, to manage the assets of the plans. Performance of investment managers is monitored by plan fiduciaries with the assistance of local investment consultants. The investment managers make investment decisions within the guidelines set forth by plan fiduciaries. Risk management practices include diversification across asset classes and investment styles, and periodic rebalancing toward target asset allocation ranges. Investment managers may use derivative instruments for efficient portfolio management purposes.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nA summary of the components of net periodic benefit costs and the weighted average assumptions used for net periodic benefit cost calculations for each fiscal year is presented below:\nAsset return assumptions are derived based on actuarial and statistical methodologies, from analysis of long-term historical data relevant to the country in which each plan is in effect and the investments applicable to the corresponding plan. The discount rate for each plan was derived by reference to appropriate benchmark yields on high quality corporate bonds, allowing for the approximate duration of both plan obligations and the relevant benchmark yields.\nFuture expected benefit payments for the pension plans and the postretirement plan over the next ten fiscal years are as follows:\nCompany contributions to these plans for fiscal 2021 are expected to be approximately $6 million.\nExecutive Deferred Compensation Plans\nApplied sponsors two unfunded deferred compensation plans, the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (Predecessor EDCP) and the 2016 Deferred Compensation Plan (2016 DCP) (formerly known as the 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan), under which certain employees may elect to defer a portion of their following year\u2019s eligible earnings. The Predecessor EDCP was frozen as of December 31, 2004 such that no new deferrals could be made under the plan after that date and the plan would qualify for \u201cgrandfather\u201d relief under Section 409A of the Code. The Predecessor EDCP participant accounts continue to be maintained under the plan and credited with deemed interest. The 2016 DCP was originally implemented by Applied effective as of January 1, 2005, and amended and restated as of October 12, 2015, and is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. In addition, Applied also sponsors a non-qualified deferred compensation plan as a result of the acquisition of Varian. Amounts payable for all plans, including accrued deemed interest, totaled $151 million and $123 million at October 25, 2020 and October 27, 2019, respectively, which were included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNote 15 Income Taxes\nThe components of income before income taxes for each fiscal year were as follows:\nThe components of the provision for income taxes for each fiscal year were as follows:\nA reconciliation between the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate and Applied\u2019s actual effective income tax rate for each fiscal year is presented below:\nOn June 14, 2019, the U.S. government released regulations that significantly affect how the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) is interpreted. As a result, Applied reversed a tax benefit of $96 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 that had been realized in the first half of fiscal 2019. An accounting policy may be selected to treat GILTI temporary differences in taxable income either as a current-period expense when incurred (period cost method) or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes (deferred method). Applied has chosen the period cost method.\nBefore the Tax Act, U.S. income tax had not been provided for certain unrepatriated earnings that were considered indefinitely reinvested. Income tax is now provided for all unrepatriated earnings.\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). The enactment of the CARES Act does not result in any material adjustments to Applied\u2019s provision for income taxes.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nApplied\u2019s effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was lower than fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decline in the tax expense from changes to uncertain tax provisions year-over-year, an increased tax benefit from tax credits, and increased excess stock compensation tax benefits. This benefit was partly offset by an unfavorable settlement of an uncertain tax position in fiscal 2020.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was lower than fiscal 2018 primarily due to tax expense of $1.1 billion in fiscal 2018 for the transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act. Excluding the tax expense of $1.1 billion, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was higher than fiscal 2018 primarily due to certain provisions in the Tax Act becoming effective in fiscal 2019, tax expense of $87 million in fiscal 2019 related to changes in uncertain tax positions and the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation in fiscal 2019 being $42 million less than the prior fiscal year.\nIn the reconciliation between the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate and the effective income tax rate, the effect of foreign operations taxed at various rates represents the difference between an income tax provision at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the recorded income tax provision, with the difference expressed as a percentage of worldwide income before income taxes. This effect is substantially related to the tax effect of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates. The foreign operations with the most significant effective tax rate impact are in Singapore. The statutory tax rate for fiscal 2018 for Singapore is 17%. Applied has been granted conditional reduced tax rates that expire in fiscal 2025, excluding potential renewal and subject to certain conditions with which Applied expects to comply. The tax benefit arising from these tax rates was $215 million for fiscal 2020 or $0.23 per diluted share.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryovers. Deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized. The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nA valuation allowance is recorded to reflect the estimated amount of net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance in each fiscal year were as follows:\nAt October 25, 2020, Applied has state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $327 million, including $309 million of credits that are carried over until exhausted and $15 million that are carried over for 15 years and begin to expire in fiscal 2031. It is more likely than not that all tax credit carryforwards, net of valuation allowance, will be utilized.\nApplied maintains liabilities for uncertain tax positions. These liabilities involve considerable judgment and estimation and are continuously monitored based on the best information available. Gross unrecognized tax benefits are classified as non-current income taxes payable or as a reduction in deferred tax assets. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of gross unrecognized tax benefits in each fiscal year is as follows:\nThe increases in tax positions for prior years of $441 million for fiscal 2019 include the effect of adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2016-16 Income Tax (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. Tax expense for interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $24 million, $24 million and $12 million, respectively. The income tax liability for interest and penalties for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $74 million, $50 million and $26 million, respectively, and was classified as non-current income taxes payable.\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 are $410 million, $758 million, and $294 million, respectively, of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.\nIn fiscal 2020, Applied settled tax audits in Singapore related to fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2019 for additional tax payments of $72 million and a reduction of future tax deductions of $374 million. The tax expense impact of these settlements was $26 million. In fiscal 2019, Applied paid an immaterial amount as a result of settlements with tax authorities. In fiscal 2018, Applied paid $158 million, including interest and penalties, as a result of a settlement in Israel for fiscal 2011 through fiscal 2015 resulting in the recognition of a tax expense of $6 million.\nApplied\u2019s tax returns remain subject to examination by taxing authorities. These include U.S. returns for fiscal 2015 and later years, and foreign tax returns for fiscal 2010 and later years.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations, as well as the amounts and timing of various tax payments that may be part of the settlement process, is highly uncertain. This could cause fluctuations in Applied\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Applied continues to have ongoing negotiations with various taxing authorities throughout the year.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNote 16 Warranty, Guarantees, Commitments and Contingencies\nWarranty\nChanges in the warranty reserves during each fiscal year were as follows:\nApplied products are generally sold with a warranty for a 12-month period following installation. The provision for the estimated cost of warranty is recorded when revenue is recognized. Parts and labor are covered under the terms of the warranty agreement. The warranty provision is based on historical experience by product, configuration and geographic region. Quarterly warranty consumption is generally associated with sales that occurred during the preceding four quarters, and quarterly warranty provisions are generally related to the current quarter\u2019s sales.\nGuarantees\nIn the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 25, 2020, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $233 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements.\nApplied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. As of October 25, 2020, Applied has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately $153 million to cover these arrangements.\nLegal Matters\nFrom time to time, Applied receives notification from third parties, including customers and suppliers, seeking indemnification, litigation support, payment of money or other actions by Applied in connection with claims made against them. In addition, from time to time, Applied receives notification from third parties claiming that Applied may be or is infringing or misusing their intellectual property or other rights. Applied also is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims, both asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business.\nAlthough the outcome of the above-described matters, claims and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, Applied does not believe that any will have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nNote 17 Industry Segment Operations\nApplied\u2019s three reportable segments are: Semiconductor Systems, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets. As defined under the accounting literature, Applied\u2019s chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the President and Chief Executive Officer, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Segment information is presented based upon Applied\u2019s management organization structure as of October 25, 2020 and the distinctive nature of each segment. Future changes to this internal financial structure may result in changes to Applied\u2019s reportable segments.\nThe Semiconductor Systems reportable segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for etch, rapid thermal processing, deposition, chemical mechanical planarization, metrology and inspection, wafer packaging, and ion implantation.\nThe Applied Global Services segment provides integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity, including spares, upgrades, services, certain remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor, display and other products.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe Display and Adjacent Markets segment includes products for manufacturing liquid crystal displays (LCDs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), equipment upgrades and flexible coating systems and other display technologies for TVs, monitors, laptops, personal computers, smart phones, and other consumer-oriented devices.\nEach operating segment is separately managed and has separate financial results that are reviewed by Applied\u2019s chief operating decision-maker. Each reportable segment contains closely related products that are unique to the particular segment. Segment operating income is determined based upon internal performance measures used by Applied\u2019s chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker does not evaluate operating segments using total asset information.\nApplied derives the segment results directly from its internal management reporting system. The accounting policies Applied uses to derive reportable segment results are substantially the same as those used for external reporting purposes. Management measures the performance of each reportable segment based upon several metrics including orders, net sales and operating income. Management uses these results to evaluate the performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the reportable segments.\nThe Corporate and Other category includes revenues from products, as well as costs of products sold, for fabricating solar photovoltaic cells and modules, and certain operating expenses that are not allocated to its reportable segments and are managed separately at the corporate level. These operating expenses include costs related to share-based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resources, and research, development and engineering functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. In addition, Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment. Segment operating income also excludes interest income/expense and other financial charges and income taxes. Management does not consider the unallocated costs in measuring the performance of the reportable segments.\nInformation for each reportable segment for and as of the end of each fiscal year were as follows:\nSemiconductor Systems and Display and Adjacent Markets revenues are recognized at a point in time. Applied Global Services revenue is recognized at a point in time for tangible goods such as spare parts and equipment, and over time for service agreements. The majority of revenue recognized over time is recognized within 12 months of the contract inception.\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nNet sales for Semiconductor Systems by end use application for the periods indicated were as follows:\nThe reconciling items included in Corporate and Other were as follows:\nFor geographical reporting, revenue by geographic location is determined by the location of customers\u2019 facilities to which products were shipped. Long-lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment and are attributed to the geographic location in which they are located. Net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region for and as of each fiscal year were as follows:\nAPPLIED MATERIALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following customers accounted for at least 10 percent of Applied\u2019s net sales in each fiscal year, which were for products and services in multiple reportable segments:\n______________________________\n* Less than 10%\nNote 18 Unaudited Quarterly Consolidated Financial Data\nINDEX TO EXHIBITS\nThese Exhibits are numbered in accordance with the Exhibit Table of Item 601 of Regulation S-K:\nIncorporated by Reference\nExhibit No. Description Form File No. Exhibit No. Filing Date\n3.1\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Applied Materials, Inc., as amended and restated through March 16, 2020\n8-K 000-06920 3.1 3/16/2020\n3.2\nAmended and Restated Bylaws of Applied Materials, Inc., as amended and restated through March 16, 2020\n8-K 000-06920 3.2 3/16/2020\n4.1\nIndenture, dated June 8, 2011, by and between Applied Materials, Inc. and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee\n8-K 000-06920 4.1 6/10/2011\n4.2\nFirst Supplemental Indenture, dated June 8, 2011, by and between Applied Materials, Inc. and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee\n8-K 000-06920 4.2 6/10/2011\n4.3\nSecond Supplemental Indenture, dated September 24, 2015, by and between Applied Materials, Inc. and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee\n8-K 000-06920 4.1 9/24/2015\n4.4\nThird Supplemental Indenture, dated March 31, 2017, by and between Applied Materials, Inc. and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee\n8-K 000-06920 4.1 3/31/2017\n4.5\nFourth Supplemental Indenture dated May 29, 2020, by and between Applied Materials, Inc. and U.S. Bank National Association\n8-K 000-06920 4.1 5/29/2020\n4.6\nDescription of Registrant\u2019s Securities Registered Under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\u2020\n10.1\nForm of Indemnification Agreement between Applied Materials, Inc. and Non-Employee Directors\n10-K 000-06920 10.44 1/31/2000\n10.2\nForm of Indemnification Agreement between Applied Materials, Inc. and certain of its officers\n10-K 000-06920 10.46 1/31/2000\n10.3\nApplied Materials, Inc.
