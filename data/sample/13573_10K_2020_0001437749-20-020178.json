    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nBowl America Incorporated (herein referred to as the \u201cCompany\u201d) was incorporated in 1958. The Company commenced business with one bowling center in 1958, and at the end of fiscal year 2020, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries operated 17 bowling centers, 16 of which are owned centers. In March 2019, the Company elected not to renew the lease on one location. The lease terminated August 31, 2019.\nThe Company operates in one segment. Its principal source of revenue consists of fees charged for the use of bowling lanes and other facilities and from the sale of food and beverages for consumption on the premises. At the end of the fiscal year 2020, the Company had operating revenues from continuing operations of approximately $17.8 million, and approximately $29 million in total assets. Merchandise sales, including food and beverages, were approximately 30% of operating revenues. The balance of operating revenues (approximately 70%) represents fees for bowling and related services. Earnings per share for fiscal 2020 were $0.08.\nAs of September 1, 2020 the Company operated 9 bowling centers in the greater metropolitan area of Washington, D.C., one bowling center in the greater metropolitan area of Baltimore, Maryland, three bowling centers in the greater metropolitan area of Jacksonville, Florida, and four bowling centers in the greater metropolitan area of Richmond, Virginia. These 17 bowling centers contain a total of 682 lanes.\nThese establishments are fully air-conditioned with facilities for service of food and beverages, game rooms, rental lockers, and meeting room facilities. All centers provide shoes for rent, and bowling balls are provided free. In addition, each center sells retail bowling accessories. Most locations are equipped for glow-in-the-dark bowling, popular for parties and non-league bowling. The Company outsources the operation of its amusement games to a third party for a flat annual fee.\nThe bowling equipment essential for the Company's operation is readily available. The Company\u2019s major source of equipment is Brunswick Corporation.\nThe bowling business is a seasonal one, and most of the business takes place from October through May. It is highly competitive, but the Company has managed to maintain its position in the markets in which it operates. The principal method of competition is the quality of service furnished to the Company's customers. Its primary competitor is Bowlero Corporation and many of our centers face competition from bowling centers located in close proximity to our centers.\nCompliance with federal, state and local environmental protection laws has not materially affected the Company.\nThe number of persons employed by the Company and its subsidiaries is approximately 500 including approximately 250 full time employees.\nThe Company maintains a website at www.bowl-america.com. Information included on the Company\u2019s website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is having a material adverse effect on our business and liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is having an unprecedented impact on the U.S. economy as federal, state and local governments react to this public health crisis, which has created significant uncertainties. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the material adverse effect of the pandemic on the economy, our employees and customers, customer sentiment in general, and our bowling centers. The pandemic has materially adversely effected our near-term revenues, earnings, liquidity and cash flows, and has required significant actions in response, including but not limited to, employee furloughs and center closings, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak within the U.S., the impact on capital and financial markets and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Adverse developments could cause us to liquidate our securities portfolio, seek debt financing or sell one or more of our operating properties, at prices and/or at times that are not favorable, in order to fund continuing operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will re-commence paying dividends in the future.\nFuture developments in the continuously changing pandemic environment, whether new mandated closures or restrictions, a worsening of the global and local economy, high unemployment rates, reduced consumer discretionary spending and other factors can negatively affect our business, however it is difficult to determine with much accuracy what the longer term impact could be. Many customers have returned to our centers for open play bowling and our fall league bowling season has begun better than expected. We remain at a mandated 50% capacity, but we have been able to be creative in making maximum use of space while following requirements. However, revenues from parties and corporate events are currently non-existent.\nThe pandemic continues, with the length, severity and possible resurgence unknown. Management believes the effects of the pandemic will continue to have an adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, liquidity and operating results for fiscal 2021 and sometime after. This situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.",

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting in a process designed by, or under the supervision of the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u25cf\nPertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n\u25cf\nProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n\u25cf\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n2. Management of the Company, in accordance with Rule 13a-15(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and with the participation of the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of June 28, 2020. The framework on which management\u2019s evaluation of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is based is the \u201cInternal Control-Integrated Framework\u201d published in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (\u201cCOSO\u201d) of the Treadway Commission.\n3. Management has determined that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, as of June 28, 2020, was effective. No material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting were identified by management. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n4. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company\u2019s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management\u2019s report was not subject to attestation by the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to a permanent exemption for non-accelerated filers from the internal control audit requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nExhibit 99(b) MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements concerning our business, operations and financial performance and condition as well as our plans, objectives and expectations for our business operations and financial performance and condition that are subject to risks and uncertainties. More recent risks and uncertainties include the ongoing effects of the business disruption related to the current COVID-19 pandemic on revenues, operating income, the ability to reopen locations, governmental regulations to limit the spread of COVID-19 such as social distancing and enhanced safety measures, times of operation and reaction should the virus rise again. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our business, our sales and the industry in which we operate and our management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or development and involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that are in some cases beyond our control. The forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are made as of the date hereof. We are under no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.\nCOVID-19\nThe Company closed all bowling centers on March 18, 2020, as required by the orders from state and federal governments, in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The majority of leagues chose to end their seasons early as it became clear that a return to bowling would not be quick. Our three Florida locations reopened in May 2020, which provided the Company some revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 while all other centers remained closed. All of our Virginia centers reopened in early July, one Maryland location opened July 22 and the last closed center was allowed to reopen on August 31, 2020 with a maximum of 50 customers at one time. Almost all locations are currently required to operate at only 50% capacity. We have also implemented social distancing and enhanced cleaning procedures and all states in which we operate have mandated the wearing of masks in the centers except when eating or drinking. Our safety procedures are designed to keep employees and customers safe and have allowed us to offer league bowling. All center employees except the center manager were furloughed in March and the corporate staff was reduced to a minimum. Employees are returned to work as business requires. The Company maintained health insurance for all employees on the plan at the time of closure, paying the employee portion of premiums due for those furloughed.\nFuture developments in the continuously changing pandemic environment, whether new mandated closures or restrictions, a worsening of the global and local economy, high unemployment rates, reduced consumer discretionary spending and other factors can negatively affect our business, however it is difficult to determine with much accuracy what the longer term impact could be. Many customers have returned to our centers for open play bowling and our fall league bowling season has begun better than expected. We remain at a mandated 50% capacity, but we have been able to be creative in making maximum use of space while following requirements. However, revenues from parties and corporate events are currently non-existent.\nThe pandemic continues, with the length, severity and possible resurgence unknown. Management believes the effects of the pandemic will continue to have an adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition and operating results for fiscal 2021 and some time after.\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company is in the entertainment business which, by its nature, has ups and downs based on consumer tastes and preferences. Generally, promotional and open play bowling, which depends on the public\u2019s discretionary budget dollars and their choices, accounts for more than half of our business. While bowling has the advantage of being an entertainment that is close to home and relatively inexpensive, new forms of sports and entertainment are offered to the public continually creating challenges. Weather is also a factor, especially for casual bowlers. While extreme heat or rainy weather prompt people to look for indoor activities, heavy snow storms can keep customers from reaching the centers. Postponed league games are made up later in the season, but lost open play income is never recovered. The Company operates primarily in the Washington, DC area where its business is vulnerable to sequestration or other downsizing of the federal government. The Company operated 17 bowling centers, sixteen of which are owned by the Company, throughout fiscal 2020. In March 2019, the Company elected not to renew the lease on Bowl America Manassas, one of its two leased centers due to poor performance. The center closed for business on July 28, 2019.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company views a strong financial position as a major benefit to shareholders and emphasizes payment of dividends as part of its financial plan. A portion of earnings has consistently been invested to create a reserve to protect the Company during downturns in business, to capitalize on opportunities for expansion and modernization, to provide a secure source of income and to provide a predictable return to its owners. For these reasons, the Company prefers a conservative approach to investing rather than taking greater risk for possible rapid growth. The Company balances market volatility by using both fixed income and equity investments in managing its reserve funds. Any equity security is subject to price fluctuation; however, the stocks held by the Company have relatively low volatility. The Company has long been invested in a Government National Mortgage Association (\u201cGNMA\u201d) fund and domestically domiciled stocks, primarily telecommunications stocks, with the perceived potential of appreciation. The Company considers that this diversity also provides a measure of safety of principal.\nWith the exception of an additional 13,120 shares of Verizon, the shares of common stock in our portfolio have come from spin-offs, mergers and acquisitions of AT&T and United Telecommunications (now T-Mobile) purchased in 1979 and 1984 and from one insurance company acquired at no cost when that company demutualized. While not all shares in the portfolio are domestic American companies any longer, since the original purchases at an approximate cost of $630,000, we have received approximately $967,000 from mergers and sales, and over $5,500,000 in dividends, the majority of which are tax favored in the form of a partial exclusion from federal taxable income. These marketable securities are carried at their fair value on the last day of each reporting period. The fair value of the securities on June 28, 2020 was approximately $4,725,000 and the value of securities held at June 30, 2019 was approximately $5,100,000.\nThe Company\u2019s original investment in the Vanguard GNMA mutual fund began in 1988 with purchases of shares in the fund totaling approximately $1,400,000. The fund is carried at fair value on the last day of the reporting period. In August 2019, approximately $1,000,000 of this fund was redeemed to meet the August 2019 dividend payment. In May 2020, $500,000 was redeemed for funding for operating expenses and prize fund payments. At June 28, 2020 the fair value was approximately $491,000\nIn March 2020 the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) which is administered by the Small Business Administration was signed into law. The CARES Act established a Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) under which qualified businesses could apply for a loan to help fund payroll, rent and related costs. The Company applied for a PPP loan and on June 1, 2020 received $1,500,000 under a loan agreement which calls for interest of 1%. The loan repayment, after a seven month deferral, begins January 1, 2021 and final payment is due June 1, 2022. All or a portion of payments of principal and interest may be forgiven if used for covered, documented payroll costs, rent and utilities. We anticipate applying for loan forgiveness in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Any amount not forgiven will be due at maturity. Any expenses paid with the loan and forgiven will not be deductible for federal tax purposes.\nShort-term investments including, Certificates of Deposits, US Treasury bills, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,793,000 at the end of fiscal 2020 and $703,000 at the end of fiscal 2019.\nThe Company's position in all the above investments is a source of liquidity during downturns in business and in other times can serve as capital for expansion or other opportunities. Potential volatility in the trading prices of the marketable securities held by the Company could impact the Company\u2019s opportunities for expansion. The Board of Directors reviews the portfolio regularly and any use of this reserve at its quarterly meetings. The Company believes that cash on hand and its position in the above securities as well as operating cash flows are currently sufficient to operate the business. However, in the event the COVID-19 pandemic causes future downturns in business or extends further into future periods, the Company may seek to obtain debt financing or sell one or more of its operating properties in order to generate operating funds.\nCash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended June 28, 2020, was $862,000. Proceeds from GNMA dividends totaling approximately $26,000 in fiscal year 2020 were used to purchase additional shares in the fund. Cash flow, cash on hand and the partial redemption of GNMA funds, mentioned above, were used to meet the $2,710,000 required to pay regular dividends during the fiscal year.\nThe Company paid cash dividends totaling approximately $2.7 million, or $.525 per share, to shareholders during the 2020 fiscal year. Dividends were suspended in March 2020 following the required shutdown of the Company\u2019s bowling centers. The economic climate is part of the consideration at the Directors quarterly reviews of future estimates of cash flows. The Board of Directors decides the amount and timing of any dividend at its quarterly meeting based on its appraisal of the state of the business and estimate of opportunities at such time.\nBuilding, entertainment and restaurant equipment purchases during fiscal year 2020 used approximately $500,000.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFiscal year 2020 and 2019 each consisted of 52 weeks. However, all of our locations were closed on March 18, 2020, during our busy winter league season, by government order resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our three Florida locations were reopened in late May but were restricted to 50% capacity at any time. No other centers reopened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Accordingly, all comparisons in this discussion and throughout the report are significantly impacted by such closures. During the closure, with the exception of a manager at each location, all center personnel were furloughed and corporate office staff was severely reduced. Many maintenance and service contracts were suspended.\nThe following table sets forth the items in our consolidated summary of operations for the fiscal fourth quarters ended June 28, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively, and the dollar and percentage changes therein.\nThe following table sets forth the items in our consolidated summary of operations for the 52 week fiscal years ended June 28, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively, and the dollar and percentage changes therein.\nThe net loss for the thirteen week period ended June 28, 2020 was $916,302 or $.18 per share. Net earnings for the fifty-two week period ended June 28, 2020 were $403,192 or $.08 per share. Net earnings were $245,106 or $.05 per share for the thirteen week period and $3,049,172 or $.59 per share for the fifty-two week period ended June 30, 2019. The change in net earnings from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2019 was a direct result of reduced operating revenues caused by the closures.\nOperating Revenues\nTotal operating revenue decreased 27.2%, or $6,638,000 to $17.8 million in fiscal 2020 compared to a decrease of 1.4%, or $352,000, to $24.4 million in fiscal 2019. Bowling and other revenue decreased $4,604,000 in fiscal 2020 versus a decrease of $345,000 in fiscal 2019. Food, beverage and merchandise sales decreased $2,034,000 and decreased $7,000 in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nAs discussed in more detail below, total operating expenses decreased 17.8%, or $3,767,000 in fiscal year 2020 versus an increase of 2.2%, or $451,000 in fiscal 2019. Costs for employee compensation and benefits decreased $2,324,000 or 21.0% in fiscal 2020 and in fiscal 2019 costs increased 1.7% or $183,000 in part due to increased overtime during the tight labor market. Group health insurance costs increased in part because the Company paid the employee portion of premiums while employees were furloughed due to the required shutdown. This category includes contributions to our two benefit plans, both of which are defined contribution plans. The contributions can only be made from profits and there is no additional obligation beyond the current year contribution.\nCost of bowling and other services decreased $975,000 or 16.0% in the year ended June 28, 2020 and increased $194,000 or 3.3% in the prior fiscal year. Maintenance expense decreased $279,000 or 28.8% in fiscal 2020 versus an increase of $86,000 or 9.7% in fiscal 2019 primarily due to a major plumbing repair at one location. Both years included roof repairs and changeover to LED lights in parking lots. Utility costs declined 15.3% in the current year and declined 2.4% in the prior year. Supplies expense decreased 21.0% in fiscal 2020 versus an increase of 1.0% in fiscal 2019.\nAdvertising costs declined $74,000 or 20.4% in fiscal year 2020 versus an increase of $51,000 or 16.3% primarily due to increase social network use in the prior year.\nCost of food, beverage and merchandise sales decreased $545,000 or 25.8% in fiscal 2020.\nDepreciation expense decreased approximately $26,000 or 2.6% in fiscal 2020, a combination of large items reaching full depreciation and the closing of Bowl America Manassas, versus an increase of approximately $37,000 or 3.9% in the prior year.\nOperating income decreased 89.8% or $2,887,000 to $328,000 in fiscal year 2020 from $3.2 million in fiscal 2019.\nInterest, Dividend and Other Income\nInterest, dividend and other income increased $39,000 or 9.6% in fiscal 2020 and increased $17,000 or 4.4% in the prior year. In fiscal 2020 interest was down, however payment for a right of way and rental of parking spaces offset the decline.\nChange in the value of investments\nFinancial Standards Accounting Board guidance requires the recognition of changes in the fair value of equity securities in current income. The change in the fair value of the GNMA fund and equity securities at June 28, 2020 was a decline of $367,000 from June 30, 2019.\nIncome taxes\nEarnings before taxes in fiscal 2020 were $404,020 of which approximately $261,000 was from dividends received. The combination of the 50% dividends received deduction and tax deferrals on property and equipment reduced the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 to 0.24%. Taxes for fiscal 2019 reflect an effective tax rate of approximately 22.7%.\nNet Earnings\nNet earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2020 were $403,000, or $.08 per share, compared to $3.0 million, or $.59 per share in fiscal 2019.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nWe have identified accounting for marketable investment securities as a critical accounting policy due to the significance of the amounts included in our balance sheet under the captions of Short term investments and Marketable investment securities. The Company exercises judgment in determining their fair value. The Company records these investments at their fair value with the unrealized gain or loss recorded in income or loss in the current period.\nWe have identified accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets as a critical accounting policy due to the significance of the amounts included in our balance sheet under the caption of Land, Buildings and Equipment. The Company reviews long-lived assets whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In making such evaluations, the Company compares the expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the assets. An impairment loss equal to the difference between the assets' fair value and carrying value is recognized when the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount. There were no impairment losses recorded in fiscal 2020 or 2019.\nExhibit 99(a) Selected Financial Data\nBOWL AMERICA INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS\nSelected Financial Data\n1395 Piccard Drive, Suite 240\nRockville, Maryland 20850\nPhone 301.337.3305\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nBowl America Incorporated\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Bowl America Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 28, 2020 and June 30, 2019, and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Earnings, Stockholders\u2019 Equity and Cash Flows for the years ended June 28, 2020 and June 30, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 28, 2020 and June 30, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 28, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2014.\n/s/ MN Blum LLC\nMN Blum, LLC\nRockville, Maryland\nSeptember 24, 2020\nExhibit 99(c) Consolidated Financial Statements\nBOWL AMERICA INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nThe accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these financial statements.\nBOWL AMERICA INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS\nThe accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these financial statements.\nBOWL AMERICA INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nThe accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these financial statements.\nBOWL AMERICA INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nThe accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these financial statements.\nBOWL AMERICA INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOrganization\nBowl America Incorporated was engaged in the operation of 17 bowling centers, with food and beverage service in each center. Nine centers are located in metropolitan Washington D.C., one center in metropolitan Baltimore, Maryland, four centers in metropolitan Richmond, Virginia, and three centers in metropolitan Jacksonville, Florida. These 17 centers contain a total of 682 lanes. The Company operates in one segment.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned subsidiary corporations. All significant inter-company items have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest to June 30. Fiscal year 2020 ended June 28, 2020, and fiscal year 2019 ended June 30, 2019. Fiscal years 2020 and 2019 each consisted of 52 weeks.\nSubsequent Events\nThe Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date of filing these financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 24, 2020.\nEstimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include depreciation expense, cash surrender value of officers' life insurance, the Federal and State income taxes (current and deferred), and market assumptions used in estimating the fair value of certain assets such as marketable securities and long-lived assets.\nRevenue recognition policy\nThe Company\u2019s performance obligations are generally limited to providing bowling services and food and beverage products at its centers. The obligations are generally incurred and satisfied in the same business day with payment received at the time the obligation is satisfied. Revenue is recognized at the time the performance obligation is satisfied, which generally occurs when the customer pays for games already bowled or receives their food or beverage order.\nMerchandise sales are recorded as revenue when the merchandise is provided to the customer which generally is also the time payment is received. Merchandise can be returned 30 days from purchase for a full refund. Historically, merchandise returns have been minimal.\nThe Company does occasionally incur contractual obligations for group events that may either be prepaid or billed following the event as well as obligations for gift cards. Any prepayments for bowling events and for the sale of gift cards are recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue from gift cards are recognized as the gift card holder purchases services and expends the prepayment amount on the card. The gift cards have no expiration date. Any events that are billed subsequent to occurrence are recognized as revenue when the event has completed. The Company has $14,877 of billed and uncollected receivables related to events that have occurred which are included in Prepaid expenses and other on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Prepaid gift cards and prepaid events totaled $163,348 and are included in accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for financial statement purposes are calculated by use of the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is calculated over the estimated useful life of the asset or term of the lease, whichever is shorter. The categories of property, plant, and equipment and the ranges of estimated useful lives on which depreciation and amortization rates are based are as follows:\nMaintenance and repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense when incurred. Major replacements and betterments are capitalized. The accounts are adjusted for the sale or other disposition of property, and the resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to income.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In making such evaluations, the Company compares the expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the assets. An impairment loss, equal to the difference between the assets' fair value and carrying value, is recognized when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount.\nDividends\nIt is the Company's policy to accrue a dividend liability at the time the dividends are declared.\nAdvertising Expense\nIt is the Company's policy to expense advertising expenditures as they are incurred. The Company's advertising expenses for the years ending June 28, 2020, and June 30, 2019, were $288,021 and $361,744, respectively.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Inventories consist of resale merchandise including food and beverage and bowling supplies.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax liabilities and assets are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using tax rates currently in effect. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nInvestment Securities\nAll of the Company's readily marketable debt and equity securities are classified as trading. Accordingly, these securities are recorded at fair value with any unrealized gains and losses reported in earnings. Realized gains or losses on the sale of debt and equity securities are reported in earnings and determined using the adjusted cost of the specific security sold.\nEarnings Per Share\nEarnings per share basic and diluted, have been calculated using the weighted average number of shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding of 5,160,971, for both fiscal years 2020 and 2019.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers money market funds and certificates of deposits, with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash accounts which may exceed federally insured limits during the year, but does not believe that this results in any significant credit risk.\nOther Current Liabilities\nOther current liabilities include prize fund monies held by the Company for bowling leagues. The funds are returned to the leagues at the end of the league bowling season. At June 28, 2020 and June 30, 2019 other current liabilities included $243,500 and $300,920, respectively, in prize fund monies.\nReclassifications\nCertain previous year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.\nAccounting Standards\nIn January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on equity securities that requires entities to recognize changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities in income in the current period unless the entity is recording the related investment under the equity method or consolidating the related entity. The Company adopted this standard effective July 2, 2018. The result was the reclassification of $2,102,745 (after adoption of ASU 2018-02) from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The Company also reclassified all of its marketable equity securities as current assets on consolidated balance sheet.\nThe following table summarizes the impact of the adoption on accumulated other comprehensive earnings and retained earnings:\nAmount\nAccumulated other comprehensive earnings, 7/2/2018\n$ 2,102,745\nReclassification to retained earnings of cumulative effect adjustment to initially apply new accounting guidance for equity investments which were previously classified as available-for-sale, net of tax $1,394,695\n(2,102,745 )\nAccumulated other comprehensive earnings as adjusted, 7/2/2018\n-\nRetained earnings, 7/2/2018\n14,010,725\nReclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income of cumulative effect adjustment to initially apply new accounting guidance for equity investments which were previously classified as available-for-sale, net of tax, $1,394,695\n2,102,745\nRetained earnings as adjusted, 7/2/2018\n$ 16,113,470\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on leases which requires entities to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases, including operating leases, with terms of more than 12 months. The new guidance also requires additional disclosures on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information. This amendment is effective for the Company\u2019s fiscal year ended June 2020. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a right to use asset of $1,977,523 and a corresponding lease liability for the same amount being recorded on July 1, 2019. The adoption was done on a modified retrospective basis with no adjustments made to periods prior to July 1, 2019.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d), which creates a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. Under this ASU and subsequently issued amendments, an entity should recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services. ASU 2014-9 may be adopted either retrospectively or on a modified retrospective basis. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The FASB permits early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. The Company adopted the standard for its 2019 fiscal year. The impact of adopting the standard was not material.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. As part of the FASB's disclosure framework project, it has eliminated, amended and added disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Entities will no longer be required to disclose the amount of, and reasons for, transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the policy of timing of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. Public companies will be required to disclose the range and weighted average used to develop significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements. This ASU is effective for public entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of any interim or annual reporting period. The Company adopted the standard for its March 2020 fiscal quarter. The impact of adopting the standard was not material.\n2. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nCash and cash equivalents consisted of the following:\nThe account balances at times exceed federally insured limits. The Company does not believe this poses any significant risk.\n3. INVESTMENTS\nThe Company\u2019s investments are categorized as trading. The cost for marketable securities cost was determined using the specific identification method. The fair values of marketable investment securities are based on the quoted market price for those securities. Short-term investments consist of certificates of deposits and U. S. Treasury bills with maturities of generally three months to one year. The fair value of the short-term investments at June 28, 2020 was $134,202 and at June 30, 2019, was $433,249. Equity securities consist primarily of telecommunications stocks and a mutual fund that invests in federal agency mortgage backed securities (Ginnie Mae). At June 28, 2020 and June 30, 2019, unrealized gains and losses are reported as income in the current period.\nAs of June 28, 2020, $15,569 in gross unrealized gains were from its investments in federal agency mortgage backed securities owned through a mutual fund which had a fair value of $490,748. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had $8,162 of gross unrealized gains from the same fund which had a fair value of $1,929,575. In August 2019 the Company redeemed $1,000,000 of this fund to meet the August 2019 dividend payment and in May 2020 $500,000 was redeemed to meet operating expenses and prize fund payouts after the March 2020 COVID-19 required our bowling centers to shutdown.\nThe Company\u2019s investments were as follows:\nDuring fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, the Company had certain equity securities with cumulative unrealized losses of $27,012 and $16,716 respectively.\nThe equity securities portfolio includes the following stocks:\nOn April 1, 2020 T-Mobile and Sprint merged. Each Sprint share was converted to 0.10256 shares of T-Mobile.\nIn February 2019 Windstream voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to restructure. The company is continuing to operate during this process.\nAs stated in Note 1, the Company records its readily marketable debt and equity securities at fair value. These assets are valued in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nA financial instrument\u2019s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe fair value of these assets as of June 28, 2020 is as follows:\nThe fair value of these assets as of June 30, 2019 was as follows:\nThe fair value of certificates of deposits is estimated using net present value techniques and comparing the values to certificates with similar terms.\n4. LAND, BUILDINGS, AND EQUIPMENT\nLand, buildings, and equipment, at cost, consisted of the following:\nDepreciation and amortization expense for buildings and equipment for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was $957,138, and $982,760, respectively. The Company includes construction in progress costs in the bowling lanes and equipment not yet in use category until completion of the project. Bowling lanes and equipment not yet in use are not depreciated.\n5. NOTE PAYABLE - PPP LOAN\nIn March 2020 the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) which is administered by the Small Business Administration was signed into law. The CARES Act established a Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) under which qualified businesses could apply for a loan to help fund payroll, rent and related costs. The Company applied for a PPP loan and on June 1, 2020 received $1,500,000 under a loan agreement which calls for interest of 1%. The loan repayment, after a seven month deferral, begins January 1, 2021, based on a level amortization of principal over a two year period and final payment equal to the unpaid principal plus unpaid accrued interest and any other amount owed, is due June 1, 2022. Future payments due prior to any forgiveness are $1,500,000. All or a portion of payments of principal and interest may be forgiven if used for covered, documented payroll costs, rent and utilities. We anticipate applying for loan forgiveness in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Any amount not forgiven will be due at maturity. Any expenses paid with the loan and forgiven will not be deductible for federal tax purposes.\n6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLease Commitments\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are obligated under long-term real estate lease agreements for one bowling center. The lease is classified as an operating lease in accordance with ASU 2016-02. For the fiscal year ended June 28, 2020, the Company recorded amortization of its right to use asset under the lease of $164,586 which is included as a component of rent expense. The lease liability at June 28, 2020 was $1,824,864. The current portion of the lease liability of $152,493 is included in other current liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. The lease provides for additional annual rents based on gross revenues and increases in real estate taxes and common facilities costs.\nAt June 28, 2020, the minimum fixed rental commitments related to all non-cancelable leases, were as follows:\nNet rent expense was as follows:\nPurchase Commitments\nThe Company's purchase commitments at June 28, 2020 are for materials, supplies, services and equipment as part of the normal course of business.\n7. PROFIT-SHARING AND ESOP PLAN\nThe Company has two defined contribution plans. The first is a profit-sharing plan which, generally, covers all employees who on the last day of the fiscal year or December 29 have been employed for one year with at least one thousand hours of service. The Plan provides for Company contributions as determined by the Board of Directors. For the years ended June 28, 2020 and June 30, 2019, contributions in the amounts of $20,000 and $96,000, respectively, were charged to operating expense.\nEffective March 31, 1987, the Company adopted an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) which generally covers all individuals who were employed at the end of the fiscal year and had one thousand or more hours of service during that fiscal year. The ESOP plan provides for Company contributions as determined by the Board of Directors. The Company contributed $20,000 for fiscal year 2020 and $96,000 for fiscal year 2019. The Company has no defined benefit plan or other post retirement plan.\n8. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company is required to analyze all material positions it has taken or plans to take in all tax returns that have been filed or should have been filed with all taxing authorities for all years still subject to challenge by those taxing authorities. If the position taken is \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the taxing authority on its technical merits and if there is more than a 50% likelihood that the position would be sustained if challenged and considered by the highest court in the relevant jurisdiction, the tax consequences of that position should be reflected in the taxpayer\u2019s financial statements.\nThe Company had no material unrecognized tax positions at June 28, 2020 nor does it expect any significant change in that status during the next twelve months. No accrued interest or penalties on uncertain tax positions have been included on the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive earnings or the consolidated balance sheet. Should the Company adopt tax positions for which it would be appropriate to accrue interest and penalties, such costs would be reflected in the tax expense for the period in which such costs accrued. The Company is subject to U.S. Federal income tax and to several state jurisdictions. Returns filed for tax periods ending after July 3, 2016 are still open to examination by those relevant taxing authorities.\nThe significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nIncome tax expense differs from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before tax for the following reasons:\nThe Company\u2019s income tax rate is significantly lower than statutory rates primarily due to the exclusion of 50% of dividend income from federal taxation as well as the federal tip credit offsetting income taxes owed by the Company.\n9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nThe Class A shares have one vote per share. The Class B shares may vote ten votes per share and are convertible to Class A shares at the option of the stockholder.\nAt June 28, 2020, and June 30, 2019, the Company had $34,799 in employee loans related to the issuance of shares, respectively. These loans are secured by the shares of the Company's common stock acquired and are full recourse notes. The notes bear interest at rates of 1.5% to 2.0% and are payable over a term of three years from the date of the agreements which range from 2018 to 2020. These employee loans have been recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital."
