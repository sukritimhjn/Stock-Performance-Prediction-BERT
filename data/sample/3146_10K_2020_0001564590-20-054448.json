    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nOVERVIEW\nSpire Inc. (\u201cSpire\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) was formed in 2000 and is the holding company for Spire Missouri Inc. (\u201cSpire Missouri\u201d), Spire Alabama Inc. (\u201cSpire Alabama\u201d), other gas utilities, and gas-related businesses. Spire Missouri was formed in 1857 and Spire Alabama was formed in 1948 by the merger of two gas companies. Spire is committed to transforming its business and pursuing growth through growing organically, investing in infrastructure, and advancing through innovation. The Company has two key business segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing.\nThe Gas Utility segment includes the regulated operations of Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama, Spire Gulf Inc. (\u201cSpire Gulf\u201d) and Spire Mississippi Inc. (\u201cSpire Mississippi\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cUtilities\u201d). The business of the Utilities is subject to seasonal fluctuations with the peak period occurring in the winter heating season, typically November through April of each fiscal year. Spire Missouri is a public utility engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas, with primary offices located in St. Louis, Missouri. Spire Missouri is the largest natural gas distribution utility system in Missouri, serving approximately 1.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in St. Louis, Kansas City, and other areas in Missouri. Spire Alabama is a public utility engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas principally in central and northern Alabama, serving more than 0.4 million residential, commercial and industrial customers with primary offices located in Birmingham, Alabama. Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi are utilities engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas to 0.1 million customers in the Mobile, Alabama area and south-central Mississippi.\nThe Gas Marketing segment includes Spire Marketing Inc. (\u201cSpire Marketing\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary providing natural gas marketing services.\nAs of September 30, 2020, Spire had 3,583 employees, including 2,424 for Spire Missouri and 947 for Spire Alabama. We believe that:\n1.\nthe safety and well-being of our employees is one of our most important responsibilities,\n2.\nthe development, education and advancement of employees is key to our sustainability, and\n3.\nembracing an inclusive workforce full of diverse backgrounds and perspectives drives innovation.\nWe have implemented processes, procedures and programs that have helped us reduce our employee injury rate for the sixth fiscal year in a row, marking a 17% year-over-year improvement and an overall improvement of 57% since fiscal year 2015. We remain very focused on reducing at-fault motor vehicle accidents, thereby improving safety for our employees and our communities, and this past year, the American Gas Association recognized us for our commitment to safety with the Accident Prevention Certificate. Due to our swift and strategic response to COVID-19, we did not furlough or lay off any employees in fiscal year 2020. We offer incentives for weight management and gym membership, as well as employee assistance programs to provide counseling services and emotional support, and in 2020, we created a formalized comprehensive well-being program that focuses on the physical, emotional, social and financial health of every employee.\nAll employees have access to developmental assessments, customized training, specialized degree programs, and partnerships with best-in-class organizations related to industry courses, leadership and management workshops and computer application development seminars. In addition, all employees are eligible for up to $6,000 per year in tuition assistance and have access to the Spire Learning Center, our robust internal learning management system. In their first year, each construction and maintenance employee receives 80 hours of safety training, while each service and installation employee receives 200 hours. Field operations employees average 24 hours of technical and procedural training annually.\nWe regularly review and adjust our affirmative action plans based on placement and utilization rates, and we strive to create an even more diverse and inclusive work environment by committing to and achieving the goals of the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion Pledge. In addition, during fiscal year 2020, we adopted a Human Rights Policy, which is our first step in demonstrating that Spire understands its universal responsibility to respect human rights. This policy provides the basis for publicly affirming our values and embedding the responsibility into Spire\u2019s operations and the way we do business.\nSpire uses its website, SpireEnergy.com, as a routine channel for distribution of important information including news releases, analyst presentations and financial information. The information Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama file or furnish to the United States (U.S.) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and their amendments, and proxy statements are available free of charge under \u201cFilings & reports\u201d in the Investors section of Spire\u2019s website, SpireEnergy.com, as soon as reasonably practical after the information is filed with or furnished to the SEC. Information contained on Spire\u2019s website is not incorporated by reference in this report. The SEC also maintains a website that contains Spire\u2019s SEC filings (sec.gov).\nGAS UTILITY\nNatural Gas Supply\nThe Utilities\u2019 fundamental gas supply strategy is to meet the two-fold objective of 1) ensuring a dependable gas supply is available for delivery when needed and 2) insofar as is compatible with that dependability, purchasing gas that is economically priced. In structuring their natural gas supply portfolio, the Utilities focus on natural gas assets that are strategically positioned to meet the Utilities\u2019 primary objectives.\nSpire Missouri focuses its gas supply portfolio around a number of large natural gas suppliers with equity ownership or control of assets strategically situated to complement its regionally diverse firm transportation arrangements. Spire Missouri utilizes Midcontinent, Gulf Coast, Northeast, and Rocky Mountain gas sources to provide a level of supply diversity that facilitates the optimization of pricing differentials as well as protecting against the potential of regional supply disruptions. Further, Spire STL Pipeline, a wholly owned subsidiary of Spire, is capable of delivering up to 4 million therms per day of natural gas into eastern Missouri, of which Spire Missouri is the foundation shipper with a contractual commitment of 3.5 million therms per day.\nIn fiscal year 2020, Spire Missouri purchased natural gas from 27 different suppliers to meet its total service area current gas sales and storage injection requirements. Spire Missouri entered into firm agreements with suppliers including major producers and marketers providing flexibility to meet the temperature-sensitive needs of its customers. Natural gas purchased by Spire Missouri for delivery to its service areas included 50.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf) on the Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc. (Southern Star), 31.3 Bcf through the Enable Mississippi River Transmission LLC (MRT) system, and a combined 39.3 Bcf on the Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission, LLC (TIGT), Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, LP (PEPL), Rockies Express Pipeline, LLC (REX), and Spire STL Pipeline systems. Spire Missouri also holds firm transportation arrangements on several other interstate pipeline systems that provide access to gas supplies upstream. Some of Spire Missouri\u2019s commercial and industrial customers purchased their own gas with Spire Missouri transporting 45.9 Bcf to them through its distribution system.\nThe fiscal year 2020 peak day send out of natural gas to Spire Missouri customers, including transportation customers, occurred on February 13, 2020. The average temperature was 11 degrees Fahrenheit in St. Louis and 13 degrees Fahrenheit in Kansas City. On that day, Spire Missouri\u2019s customers consumed 1.56 Bcf of natural gas. For eastern Missouri, this peak day demand was met with natural gas transported to St. Louis through the MRT, MoGas Pipeline LLC, Spire STL Pipeline, and Southern Star transportation systems, and from Spire Missouri\u2019s on-system storage. For western Missouri, this peak day demand was met with natural gas transported to Kansas City through the Southern Star, PEPL, TIGT, and REX transportation systems.\nSpire Alabama\u2019s distribution system is connected to two major interstate natural gas pipeline systems, Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. (Southern Natural Gas) and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco). It is also connected to two intrastate natural gas pipeline systems.\nSpire Alabama purchases natural gas from various natural gas producers and marketers. Certain volumes are purchased under firm contractual commitments with other volumes purchased on a spot market basis. The purchased volumes are delivered to Spire Alabama\u2019s system using a variety of firm transportation, interruptible transportation and storage capacity arrangements designed to meet the system\u2019s varying levels of demand.\nIn fiscal 2020, Spire Alabama purchased natural gas from 23 different suppliers to meet current gas sales, storage injection, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) liquefaction requirements, of which five are under long-term supply agreements. Approximately 64.0 Bcf was purchased for delivery by Southern Natural Gas, 5.2 Bcf by Transco, and 9.4 Bcf through intrastate pipelines to the Spire Alabama delivery points for its residential, commercial, and industrial customers.\nThe fiscal 2020 peak day send out for Spire Alabama was 0.5 Bcf on November 12, 2019, when the average temperature was 34 degrees Fahrenheit in Birmingham, of which 100% was met with supplies transported through Southern Natural Gas, Transco, intrastate facilities, and one of the four LNG peak shaving facilities.\nSpire Gulf\u2019s distribution system is directly connected to interstate pipelines, natural gas processing plants and gas storage facilities. Spire Gulf buys from a variety of producers and marketers, with BP Energy Company being the primary supplier.\nNatural Gas Storage\nSpire Missouri believes that it has ample storage capacity to meet the demands of its distribution system, particularly to augment its supply during peak demand periods. Spire Missouri has a contractual right to store 21.5 Bcf of gas in MRT\u2019s storage facility located in Unionville, Louisiana, 16.3 Bcf of gas storage in Southern Star\u2019s system storage facilities located in Kansas and Oklahoma, and 1.4 Bcf of firm storage on PEPL\u2019s system storage. MRT\u2019s tariffs allow injections into storage from May 1 through November 1 and require the withdrawal from storage of all but 4.3 Bcf from November 1 through May 1. Southern Star tariffs allow both injections and withdrawals into storage year-round with ratchets that restrict the associated flows dependent upon the underlying inventory level per the contracts.\nIn addition, Spire Missouri supplements pipeline gas with natural gas withdrawn from its own underground storage field located in St. Louis and St. Charles Counties in Missouri. The field is designed to provide approximately 0.3 Bcf of natural gas withdrawals on a peak day and maximum annual net withdrawals of approximately 4.0 Bcf of natural gas based on the inventory level that Spire Missouri plans to maintain.\nSpire Alabama has a contractual right to store 12.5 Bcf of gas with Southern Natural Gas, 0.2 Bcf of gas with Transco and 0.2 Bcf of gas with Tennessee Gas Pipeline. In addition, Spire Alabama has 1.8 Bcf of LNG storage that can provide the system with up to an additional 0.2 Bcf of natural gas daily to meet peak day demand.\nSpire Gulf obtains adequate storage capacity through Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP, and Enstor Gas, LLC\u2019s Bay Gas Storage.\nUnion Agreements\nThe Company believes labor relations with its employees are good. Should that condition change, the Company could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions that could negatively impact the Company\u2019s system operations, customer service, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe following table presents the Company\u2019s various labor agreements as of September 30, 2020:\nOperating Revenues and Customer Information\nThe following tables present information on Spire\u2019s revenues and therms sold and transported (before intersegment eliminations), and annual average numbers of customers for the three years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nTotal annual average number of customers for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama for fiscal 2020 was 1,186,523 and 424,804, respectively.\nRegulatory Matters\nFor details on regulatory matters, see Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nOther Pertinent Matters\nSpire Missouri is the only distributor of natural gas within its franchised service areas, while Spire Alabama is the main distributor of natural gas in its service areas. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have franchises in nearly all the communities where they provide service with terms varying from five years to an indefinite duration. A franchise is essentially a municipal permit to install pipes and construct other facilities in the community. All of the franchises are free from unduly burdensome restrictions and are adequate for the conduct of Spire Missouri\u2019s and Spire Alabama\u2019s current public utility businesses in their respective states. In recent years, although certain franchise agreements have expired, the Utilities have continued to provide service in those communities without formal franchises.\nThe principal competition for the Utilities comes from the local electric companies. Other competitors in the service areas include suppliers of fuel oil, coal, and propane, as well as natural gas pipelines that can directly connect to large volume customers. Coal has been price competitive as a fuel source for very large boiler plant loads, but environmental requirements have shifted the economic advantage to natural gas. Oil and propane can be used to fuel boiler loads and certain direct-fired process applications, but these fuels require on-site storage, thus limiting their competitiveness. Competition also comes from district steam systems in the downtown areas of both St. Louis and Kansas City and from municipally or publicly owned natural gas distributors located adjacent to the Alabama service territories.\nResidential, commercial, and industrial customers represent approximately 92% and 83% of fiscal 2020 operating revenues for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. Given the current level of natural gas supply and market conditions, the Utilities believe that the relative comparison of natural gas equipment and operating costs with those of competitive fuels will not change significantly in the foreseeable future, and that these markets will continue to be supplied by natural gas. In new multi-family and commercial rental markets, the Utilities\u2019 competitive exposures are presently limited to space and water heating applications.\nSpire Missouri and Spire Alabama offer gas transportation service to its large commercial and industrial customers. Transportation customers represent approximately 3% and 16% of fiscal 2020 operating revenues for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. The Spire Missouri tariff approved for that type of service produces a margin similar to that which Spire Missouri would have received under their regular sales rates. Similarly, Spire Alabama\u2019s tariff is based on Spire Alabama\u2019s sales profit margin so that operating margins are unaffected.\nThe Utilities are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that, to date, have not materially affected the Utilities\u2019 or the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations. For a detailed discussion of environmental matters, see Note 16, Commitment and Contingencies, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nGAS MARKETING\nSpire Marketing is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and providing energy services to both on-system utility transportation customers and customers outside of the Utilities\u2019 service areas. The majority of Spire Marketing\u2019s business is derived from the procurement and physical delivery of natural gas to a diverse customer base, primarily in the central and southern U.S. Through its retail operations, Spire Marketing offers natural gas marketing services to large commercial and industrial customers, while its wholesale business consists of producers, pipelines, power generators, municipalities, storage operators, and utility companies. Wholesale activities currently represent a majority of the total Gas Marketing business.\nIn the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into agreements to purchase natural gas at a future date in order to lock up supply to cover future sales commitments to its customers. To secure access to the markets it serves, Spire Marketing contracts for transportation capacity on various pipelines from pipeline companies directly and from other parties through the secondary capacity market. Throughout fiscal 2020, Spire Marketing held approximately 1.1 Bcf per day of firm transportation capacity. In addition, to ensure reliability of service and to provide operational flexibility, Spire Marketing enters into firm storage contracts and interruptible park and loan transactions with various companies, where it is able to buy and retain gas to be delivered at a future date, at which time it sells the natural gas to third parties. As of September 30, 2020, Spire Marketing has contracted for approximately 26 Bcf of such storage and park and loan capacity for the 2020-2021 winter season.\nThe Gas Marketing strategy is to leverage its market expertise and risk management skills to manage and optimize the value of its portfolio of commodity, transportation, park and loan, and storage contracts while controlling costs and acting on new marketplace opportunities. Overall, Gas Marketing saw volume growth in fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of increased business with producers and integrated utilities, retail and wholesale customer growth, and increased optimization opportunities resulting from its overall portfolio of assets. For fiscal 2020, Spire Marketing volumes averaged 2.13 Bcf/day, an improvement from 1.9 Bcf/day in fiscal 2019.\nOTHER\nOther components of the Company\u2019s consolidated information include:\n\u2022\nunallocated corporate items, including certain debt and associated interest costs;\n\u2022\nSpire STL Pipeline LLC (\u201cSpire STL Pipeline\u201d) and Spire Storage West LLC (\u201cSpire Storage\u201d), described below; and\n\u2022\nSpire\u2019s subsidiaries engaged in the operation of a propane pipeline, the compression of natural gas, and risk management, among other activities.\nSpire STL Pipeline is a wholly owned subsidiary of Spire which owns and operates a 65-mile pipeline connecting the Rockies Express Pipeline in Scott County, Illinois, to delivery points in St. Louis County, Missouri, including Spire Missouri\u2019s storage facility. The pipeline is under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and is capable of delivering up to 4 million therms per day of natural gas into eastern Missouri. Spire Missouri is the foundation shipper with a contractual commitment of 3.5 million therms per day. The pipeline was primarily constructed during fiscal 2019 and was placed into service in November 2019.\nSpire Storage is engaged in the storage of natural gas in the western region of the United States. The facility consists of two storage fields operating under one FERC market-based rate tariff. On July 1, 2020, the Board of Directors of Spire, based upon the recommendation of senior management, revised the development plan for Spire Storage. As a result of the revised development plan, an asset impairment charge was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The revision to the development plan for Spire Storage was driven by the realization that a longer time horizon will be required for optimization and positioning of the storage facility to serve energy markets in the western United States that continue to evolve. Spire remains committed to serving its customers through the ongoing development and operation of the facility. Such development is expected to include approximately $16 million in capital investment over the next year or so to enhance the capabilities of the facility. Consistent with the revised development plans, a FERC application to expand the working capacity of the facility, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, was filed on October 9, 2020. The application process and receipt of an authorizing certificate does not commit Spire to incremental capital investment in Spire Storage.",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSpire\u2019s and the Utilities\u2019 business and financial results are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below. The risks described below are those the Company and the Utilities consider to be material. When considering any investment in Spire or the Utilities\u2019 securities, investors should carefully consider the following information, as well as information contained in the caption \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d Item 7A, and other documents Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama file with the SEC. This list is not exhaustive, and Spire\u2019s and the Utilities\u2019 respective management places no priority or likelihood based on the risk descriptions, order of presentation or grouping by subsidiary. All references to dollar amounts are in millions.\nRISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO THE BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS OF SPIRE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nWe face risks related to widespread public health concerns, such as the recent coronavirus outbreak.\nThe actual or perceived effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic or similar widespread public health concern, such as COVID-19, will likely negatively affect our operations, liquidity, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions worldwide. In particular, efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 have led to shutdowns of customer operations, as well as disrupted financial markets and supply chains. The Company has implemented what we believe to be appropriate procedures and protocols to ensure the safety of our customers, suppliers and employees. These actions include activating incident management procedures, working-from-home for our office-based employees, limiting direct contact with our customers, and, from March through June, suspending disconnections and late payment charges for our utility customers. During fiscal 2020, we experienced impacts on our results of operations as a result of COVID-19 including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nreduced collection of late payment charges, lower revenue on commercial and industrial volumes;\n\u2022\nincreased bad debt expenses;\n\u2022\nincreases in certain operational expenses such as enhanced cleaning and personal protection equipment;\n\u2022\ndecreases in expense for travel and medical claims; and\n\u2022\nhigher residential customer charges due to the moratorium on disconnections.\nWe are continuing to assess the developments involving our workforce, customers and suppliers, as well as the ongoing response of federal and state authorities, our regulators and other business and community leaders. An extended slowdown of the United States' economy or demand for commodities and/or material changes in government policy in response to COVID-19 could result in lower demand for natural gas, particularly among our commercial and industrial customers, as well as negatively impact the ability of our customers, contractors, suppliers and other business partners to remain in business or return to reasonable business activity in the near future. While the crisis has not had a material effect on the Company to date, the impacts continue to unfold and the full extent of future developments are not known at this time and may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects. We have identified the following potential categories of risks for Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama outside of those already experienced through September 2020:\n\u2022\nThe health, safety and productivity of our workforce, including in a physically dispersed environment;\n\u2022\nDecreases in non-essential operational functions and/or capital investment;\n\u2022\nSupply chain impacts due to decreased production and imports of materials and supplies;\n\u2022\nThe impact on operating results due to increased costs, lower demand in Spire\u2019s service territories and/or lower fees associated with suspending service disconnections and other billing practices or other moratoriums;\n\u2022\nThe impact of new regulatory actions that could increase costs or provide for future regulatory recovery of those costs;\n\u2022\nSpire\u2019s continued ability to access normal functioning capital markets in prolonged economic downturn;\n\u2022\nAdverse investment performance for postretirement benefit plan assets or the failure to maintain sustained growth in these investments over time could lead to an increase in our plan costs and funding requirements related to the plans; and\n\u2022\nCybersecurity risks associated with a portion of our workforce working remotely.\nTo mitigate some of these risks, Spire has implemented additional health and safety precautions while continuing to service utility customers. Spire is an essential business and continues to operate, while adhering to precautionary safety measures, to ensure that critical infrastructure improvements continue and to maintain the safety of the gas distribution network. Further, we have modified certain business and workforce practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events, and conferences) to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by government and regulatory authorities. We are monitoring impacts on our operations, costs and rate bases of our businesses, and continue to explore alternative approaches to ensure the viability of our businesses and continued service to our customers.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 health crisis adversely affects our business, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this item.\nAs a holding company, Spire depends on its operating subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations.\nSpire is a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of its operating subsidiaries and cash investments. Spire, and Spire Missouri prior to the holding company\u2019s formation in 2000, has paid common stock dividends continuously since 1946. Spire\u2019s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to pay upstream dividends and make loans or loan repayments. In addition, because it is a holding company and the substantial portion of its assets are represented by its holdings in the Utilities, the risks faced by the Utilities as described below under RISKS THAT RELATE TO THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT may also adversely affect Spire\u2019s cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nA downgrade in Spire\u2019s and/or its subsidiaries\u2019 credit ratings may negatively affect its ability to access capital and its cost of capital.\nCurrently, Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama have investment grade credit ratings. There is no assurance that such credit ratings for any of the Spire companies will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Spire has a working capital line of credit to meet its short-term liquidity needs. Spire\u2019s line of credit may be used to meet the liquidity needs of any of its subsidiaries, subject to sublimits. If the rating agencies lowered the credit rating at any of these entities, particularly below investment grade, it might significantly limit that entity\u2019s ability to secure new or additional credit facilities and would increase its costs of borrowing. Spire\u2019s or the Utilities\u2019 ability to borrow under current or new credit facilities and costs of that borrowing have a direct impact on their ability to execute their operating strategies.\nPipeline integrity programs and repairs may impose significant costs and liabilities on the Company.\nThe U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in \u201chigh consequence areas\u201d where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm. As the operator of the STL Pipeline, the Company is required to:\n\u2022\nperform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;\n\u2022\nidentify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a \u201chigh consequence area\u201d;\n\u2022\nimprove data collection, integration and analysis;\n\u2022\nrepair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and\n\u2022\nimplement preventative and mitigating actions.\nThe Company is required to maintain pipeline integrity testing programs that are intended to assess pipeline integrity. Any repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures. Should the Company fail to comply with applicable statutes and the PHMSA Office of Pipeline Safety\u2019s rules and related regulations and orders, it could be subject to significant penalties and fines.\nReductions in capacity of interconnecting, third-party pipelines could cause a reduction in volumes transported by Spire STL Pipeline, which could adversely affect the Company.\nSpire STL Pipeline is dependent upon third-party pipelines and other facilities to provide delivery options to and from its pipeline. If any pipeline connection were to become unavailable for volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, Spire STL Pipeline\u2019s ability to continue shipping natural gas to end markets could be restricted, and to the extent not mitigated by contractual indemnification, insurance or tariffs, would thereby reduce its revenues. Any permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect that causes a material reduction in volumes transported on its pipeline could result in an impairment loss that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s natural gas storage business includes inherent geologic and operational risks, as well as risks from competition and changes in market fundamentals.\nIn 2017 and 2018, the Company acquired two neighboring storage facilities, one of which had been operating in bankruptcy for an extended period. The Company has restructured to integrate these facilities into one, now known as Spire Storage, to increase capacity, improve operating performance, and improve the integrity of its storage fields and associated above-ground facilities. Any damage to the storage facility or pipelines, or lack of integrity to its storage fields, to the extent not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s storage assets are connected to third-party-owned pipelines. The continuing operation of such third-party pipelines is not within its control. If any of these pipelines become unable to transport, treat or process natural gas or natural gas liquids, or if the volumes it gathers or transports do not meet the quality requirements of such pipelines, the Company\u2019s revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe Company does not own all the land on which its storage facilities were constructed, and it is, therefore, subject to the possibility of more onerous terms or increased costs to retain necessary land use, if and when applicable property rights expire or are renewed. Changes in the terms of such land use could have an adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the Company\u2019s storage business.\nSpire Storage is subject to competition from similar services provided by pipelines and from competing independent storage providers capable of serving its customers. Natural gas storage is a competitive business, with competitors having the ability to expand storage capacity. Increased competition in the natural gas storage business could reduce the demand and drive rates down for the Company\u2019s natural gas storage services.\nStorage businesses are affected by various gas market fundamentals which impact the level of demand for storage services and the rates that can be charged for these services. These market fundamentals include: seasonal price spread; monthly, daily and hourly price volatility; locational basis for pricing points on pipelines connected to a storage facility; seasonal, daily and hourly weather; and operational impacts in supply and market areas served by a storage facility and its connected pipelines. These fundamentals have varying and potentially material adverse impacts on the various services offered by storage facilities and the rates that can be charged for these services in the market. These services include long-term firm storage, short-term park and loan, wheeling, and optimization. Rates below the variable costs to operate a storage facility could result in a decision to not operate all the capacity in the facility or to operate the facility at a loss if required to fulfill firm customer contract obligations. A sustained decline in these rates or a shut-in of all or a portion of one or more facilities\u2019 capacity could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTransporting, distributing, and storing natural gas and propane involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs.\nNatural gas transportation, distribution and storage activities inherently involve a variety of hazards and operations risks, such as leaks, accidental explosions, damage caused by third parties, and mechanical problems, which could cause substantial financial losses. In addition, these risks could result in serious injury to employees and non-employees, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, and substantial losses to the Company and its subsidiaries. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. Similar risks also exist for Spire Missouri\u2019s propane storage, transmission and minor distribution operations. These activities may subject the Company to litigation or administrative proceedings. Such litigation or proceedings could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties against the Company and its subsidiaries or be resolved on unfavorable terms. The Utilities and other Spire businesses are subject to federal and state laws and regulations requiring them to maintain certain safety and system integrity measures by identifying and managing storage and pipeline risks. Compliance with these laws and regulations, or future changes in these laws and regulations, may result in increased capital, operating and other costs which may not be recoverable in a timely manner from customers in rates. In accordance with customary industry practices, the Utilities and other Spire businesses maintain insurance against a significant portion, but not all, of these risks and losses. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these events is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nIn connection with acquisitions, Spire and Spire Missouri recorded goodwill and long-lived assets that could become impaired and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nSpire and Spire Missouri assess goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company and Spire Missouri assess their long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset\u2019s carrying amount may not be recoverable. To the extent the value of goodwill or long-lived assets becomes impaired, the Company and Spire Missouri may be required to incur impairment charges that could have a material impact on their results of operations.\nSince interest rates are a key component, among other assumptions, in the models used to estimate the fair values of the Company\u2019s reporting units, rises in interest rates would generally decrease the calculated fair values and future impairments may occur. Due to the subjectivity of the assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment analysis, Spire and Spire Missouri cannot provide assurance that future analyses will not result in impairment. These assumptions and estimates include projected cash flows, current and future rates for contracted capacity, growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and market multiples.\nClimate change and regulatory and legislative developments in the energy industry related to climate change may in the future adversely affect operations and financial results.\nClimate change, and regulatory, public policy, or legislative changes to address the potential for climate change, could adversely affect operations and financial results of the Company. Management believes it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur over a long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. To the extent climate change results in warmer temperatures, financial results could be adversely affected through lower gas volumes and revenues and lack of marketing opportunities. Another possible impact of climate change may be more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, which could increase costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to customers, or result in lost revenues if the Company were unable to deliver natural gas to customers. To the extent such impacts are not covered by insurance or recovered in rates, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition, there have been a number of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane and carbon dioxide. The adoption in the future of this type of legislation by Congress or similar legislation by states or localities, or the adoption of related regulations by federal, state or local governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, restricting the use of fossil fuels, such as natural gas, or restricting the construction of infrastructure necessary to deliver natural gas to customers could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry. Such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, affect the demand for natural gas or impact the prices charged to customers. At this time, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that may be adopted on the Company\u2019s and the Utilities\u2019 future business, financial condition or financial results.\nChanges to income tax policy, certain tax elections, tax regulations and future taxable income could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company has significantly reduced its current federal and state income tax obligations over the past few years through tax planning strategies and the use of bonus depreciation deductions for certain expenditures for property. As a result, the Company has generated large annual taxable losses that have resulted in significant federal and state net operating losses in years prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company plans to utilize these net operating losses in the future to reduce income tax obligations. The value of these net operating losses could be reduced if the Company cannot generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all of the net operating losses before they expire due to lower than expected financial performance or regulatory actions.\nChanges to income tax policy, laws and regulations, including but not limited to changes in tax rates, the deductibility of certain expenses including interest and state and local income taxes and/or changes in the deductibility of certain expenditures for property, could adversely impact the Company. Those impacts could include reducing the value of its net operating losses and could result in material charges to earnings. Further, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nSpire\u2019s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are subject to investment and interest rate risk that could negatively impact its financial condition.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries have pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide benefits to many of their employees and retirees. Costs of providing benefits and related funding requirements of these plans are subject to changes in the market value of the assets that fund the plans. The funded status of the plans and the related costs reflected in the Company\u2019s financial statements are affected by various factors, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, including economic conditions, financial market performance, interest rates, life expectancies and demographics. Recessions and volatility in the domestic and international financial markets have negatively affected the asset values of Spire\u2019s pension plans at various times in the past. Poor investment returns or lower interest rates may necessitate accelerated funding of the plans to meet minimum federal government requirements, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 financial condition and results of operations. For more information, including regulatory provisions affecting the Utilities\u2019 plans, see Note 13, Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nRISKS THAT RELATE TO THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT\nRegulation of the Utilities\u2019 businesses may impact rates they are able to charge, costs, and profitability.\nThe Utilities are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. At the state level, the Utilities are regulated in Missouri by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC), in Alabama by the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC), and in Mississippi by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MSPSC). These state public service commissions regulate many aspects of the Utilities\u2019 distribution operations, including construction and maintenance of facilities, operations, safety, the rates the Utilities may charge customers, the terms of service to their customers, transactions with their affiliates, the rate of return they are allowed to realize, and the accounting treatment for certain aspects of their operations. For further discussion of these accounting matters, see Regulatory Accounting under Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7.\nAccounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items, including property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; and depreciation expense, and affects multiple disclosures in the Company\u2019s financial statements. There is a risk that the state public service commissions will not approve full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. A material disallowance of deferred costs could adversely affect the Utilities\u2019 results of operations.\nThe MoPSC also approves Spire Missouri\u2019s Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge (ISRS). The ISRS allows Spire Missouri expedited recovery for its investment to upgrade its infrastructure and enhance its safety and reliability without the necessity of a formal rate case. Such investments are subject to review, and there is risk that any material disallowance of costs under ISRS could adversely affect the timing of revenues.\nThe Utilities\u2019 ability to obtain and timely implement rate increases and rate supplements to maintain the current rate of return is subject to regulatory review and approval. There can be no assurance that they will be able to obtain rate increases or rate supplements or continue earning the current authorized rates of return. Spire Alabama\u2019s and Spire Gulf\u2019s rate setting process, Rate Stabilization and Equalization (RSE), is subject to regulation by the APSC and is implemented pursuant to APSC orders expiring September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. RSE adjustments would continue after those dates unless the APSC enters an order to the contrary in a manner consistent with the law. Spire Mississippi is subject to regulation by the MSPSC and utilizes the Rate Stabilization Adjustment (RSA) Rider. For further details, see Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nThe Utilities could incur additional costs if required to adjust to new laws or regulations, revisions to existing laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of existing laws or regulations. In addition, as the regulatory environment for the natural gas industry increases in complexity, the risk of inadvertent noncompliance could also increase. If the Utilities fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, whether existing or new, they could be subject to fines, penalties or other enforcement action by the authorities that regulate the Utilities\u2019 operations.\nThe Utilities are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies that could adversely affect their results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe Utilities are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies with respect to general claims, rates, environmental issues, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. For further details, see Contingencies in Note 16 to the financial statements in Item 8. Adverse decisions regarding these matters, to the extent they require the Utilities to make payments in excess of amounts provided for in their financial statements, or to the extent they are not covered by insurance, could adversely affect the Utilities\u2019 results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe Utilities\u2019 liquidity may be adversely affected by delays in recovery of their costs, due to regulation.\nIn the normal course of business, there is a lag between when the Utilities incur increases in certain of their costs and the time in which those costs are considered for recovery in the ratemaking process. Cash requirements for increased operating costs, increased funding levels of defined benefit pension and postretirement costs, capital expenditures, and other increases in the costs of doing business can require outlays of cash prior to the authorization of increases in rates charged to customers, as approved by the MoPSC, APSC, and MSPSC. Accordingly, the Utilities\u2019 liquidity can be adversely impacted to the extent higher costs are not timely recovered from their customers.\nThe Utilities\u2019 ability to meet their customers\u2019 natural gas requirements may be impaired if contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner.\nIn order to meet their customers\u2019 annual and seasonal natural gas demands, the Utilities must obtain sufficient supplies, interstate pipeline capacity, and storage capacity. If they are unable to obtain these, either from their suppliers\u2019 inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities, to the extent not mitigated by tariffs, contractual indemnification or insurance, the Utilities\u2019 financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If a substantial disruption in interstate natural gas pipelines\u2019 transmission and storage capacity were to occur during periods of heavy demand, the Utilities\u2019 financial results could be adversely impacted.\nThe Utilities\u2019 liquidity and, in certain circumstances, the Utilities\u2019 results of operations may be adversely affected by the cost of purchasing natural gas during periods in which natural gas prices are rising significantly.\nThe tariff rate schedules of Spire Missouri, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi contain Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clauses and Spire Alabama\u2019s tariff rate schedule contains a Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider that permit the Utilities to file for rate adjustments to recover the cost of purchased gas. Changes in the cost of purchased gas are flowed through to customers and may affect uncollectible amounts and cash flows and can therefore impact the amount of capital resources.\nCurrently, Spire Missouri is allowed to adjust the gas cost component of rates up to four times each year while Spire Alabama and Spire Gulf (collectively, the \u201cAlabama Utilities\u201d) and Spire Mississippi may adjust the gas cost component of their rates on a monthly basis. Spire Missouri must make a mandatory gas cost adjustment at the beginning of the winter, in November, and during the next twelve months may make up to three additional discretionary gas cost adjustments, so long as each of these adjustments is separated by at least two months.\nThe MoPSC typically approves the Spire Missouri PGA changes on an interim basis, subject to refund and the outcome of a subsequent audit and prudence review. Due to such review process, there is a risk of a disallowance of full recovery of these costs. Any material disallowance of purchased gas costs would adversely affect results of operations. The Alabama Utilities\u2019 gas supply charges are submitted for APSC review on a monthly basis, regardless of whether there is a request for a change, so prudence review occurs on an ongoing basis. Spire Mississippi\u2019s PGA is adjusted on a monthly basis for the most recent charges and is filed at the MSPSC on a monthly basis.\nIncreases in the prices the Utilities charge for gas may also adversely affect revenues because they could lead customers to reduce usage and cause some customers to have trouble paying the resulting higher bills. These higher prices may increase bad debt expenses and ultimately reduce earnings. Rapid increases in the price of purchased gas may result in an increase in short-term debt.\nTo lower financial exposure to commodity price fluctuations, Spire Missouri enters into contracts to hedge the forward commodity price of its natural gas supplies. As part of this strategy, Spire Missouri may use fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts, swaps, futures, and option contracts. However, Spire Missouri does not hedge the entire exposure of energy assets or positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Any costs, gains, or losses experienced through hedging procedures, including carrying costs, generally flow through the PGA clause, thereby limiting Spire Missouri\u2019s exposure to earnings volatility. However, variations in the timing of collections of such gas costs under the PGA clause and the effect of cash payments for margin deposits associated with Spire Missouri\u2019s use of natural gas derivative instruments may cause short-term cash requirements to vary. These procedures remain subject to prudence review by the MoPSC.\nOther than fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts, Spire Alabama currently does not utilize risk mitigation strategies that incorporate commodity hedge instruments but has the ability to do so through its GSA. Spire Gulf hedges gas supply for up to 30 months in advance, and Spire Mississippi utilizes hedging for the upcoming heating season.\nThe Utilities\u2019 business activities are concentrated in three states.\nThe Utilities provide natural gas distribution services to customers in Alabama, Mississippi, and Missouri. Changes in the regional economies, politics, regulations and weather patterns of these states could negatively impact the Utilities\u2019 growth opportunities and the usage patterns and financial condition of customers and could adversely affect the Utilities\u2019 earnings, cash flows, and financial position.\nThe Utilities may be adversely affected by economic conditions.\nPeriods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased energy consumption, particularly by industrial and large commercial companies, a loss of existing customers, fewer new customers especially in newly constructed buildings. As a consequence, national or regional recessions or other downturns in economic activity could adversely affect the Utilities\u2019 revenues and cash flows or restrict their future growth. Economic conditions in the Utilities\u2019 service territories may also adversely impact the Utilities\u2019 ability to collect accounts receivable, resulting in an increase in bad debt expense.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may require significant expenditures or increase operating costs.\nThe Utilities are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations. These laws and regulations require the Utilities to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and approvals. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations and failure to obtain any required permits and licenses may result in costs to the Utilities in the form of fines, penalties or business interruptions, which may be material. In addition, existing environmental laws and regulations could be revised or reinterpreted and/or new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to the Utilities or their facilities, thereby impacting the Utilities\u2019 cost of compliance. The discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions, including former manufactured gas plant sites, and claims against the Utilities under environmental laws and regulations may result in expenditures and liabilities, which could be material. To the extent environmental compliance costs are not fully covered by insurance or recovered in rates from customers, those costs may have an adverse effect on the Utilities\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of competition, the Utilities may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers, which could have an adverse impact on their business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Utilities face the risk that larger commercial or industrial customers may bypass gas distribution services by gaining distribution directly from interstate pipelines or, in the case of Spire Alabama and Spire Gulf, also from municipally or publicly owned gas distributors located adjacent to its service territory. The Utilities cannot provide any assurance that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Utilities compete with distributors offering a broad range of services and prices, from full-service distributors to those offering delivery only. The Utilities also compete for retail customers with suppliers of alternative energy products, principally propane and electricity. If they are unable to compete effectively, the Utilities may lose existing customers and/or fail to acquire new customers, which in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on their business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in the wholesale costs of purchased natural gas supplies may adversely impact the Utilities\u2019 competitive position compared with alternative energy sources.\nChanges in wholesale natural gas prices compared with prices for electricity, fuel oil, coal, propane, or other energy sources may affect the Utilities\u2019 retention of natural gas customers and may adversely impact their financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificantly warmer-than-normal weather conditions, the effects of climate change, legislative and regulatory initiatives in response to climate change or in support of increased energy efficiency, and other factors that influence customer usage may affect the Utilities\u2019 sale of heating energy and adversely impact their financial position and results of operations.\nThe Utilities\u2019 earnings are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy. Spire Missouri and Spire Mississippi each have a Weather Normalization Adjustment rider, Spire Alabama has a Temperature Adjustment Rider, and Spire Gulf has a Weather Impact Normalization Factor. These mechanisms, approved by the respective state regulatory body, provide better assurance of the recovery of fixed costs and margins during winter months despite variations in sales volumes due to the impacts of weather, while the annual rate designs of Alabama and Mississippi help adjust for other factors that affect customer usage. However, significantly warmer-than-normal weather conditions in the Utilities\u2019 service areas and other factors, such as climate change, alternative energy sources and increased efficiency of gas furnaces and other appliances, may result in reduced profitability and decreased cash flows attributable to lower gas sales. Furthermore, continuation of these adjustment factors is subject to regulatory discretion.\nIn addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives by the federal, state and local governments addressing greenhouse gas emissions or restricting the use of natural gas could adversely affect customer demand. The promulgation of regulations of the emissions of greenhouse gases and efficiency for residential gas furnaces and other gas appliances or the potential enactment of congressional legislation addressing global warming and climate change may decrease customer usage, encourage fuel switching from gas to other energy forms, and may result in future additional compliance costs that could impact the Utilities\u2019 financial conditions and results of operations.\nRegional supply/demand fluctuations and changes in national infrastructure, as well as regulatory discretion, may adversely affect the Utilities\u2019 ability to profit from off-system sales and capacity release.\nSpire Missouri\u2019s and Spire Alabama\u2019s income from off-system sales and capacity release is subject to fluctuations in market conditions and changing supply and demand conditions in areas the Utilities hold pipeline capacity rights. Specific factors impacting the Utilities\u2019 income from off-system sales and capacity release include the availability of attractively priced natural gas supply, availability of pipeline capacity, and market demand. Income from off-system sales and capacity release is shared with customers. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama are allowed to retain 25% of the net margins achieved as a result of such off-system sales and capacity releases. The Utilities\u2019 ability to retain such income in the future is subject to regulatory discretion.\nRISKS THAT RELATE TO THE GAS MARKETING SEGMENT\nIncreased competition, fluctuations in natural gas commodity prices, expiration of supply and transportation arrangements, and infrastructure projects may adversely impact the future profitability of Gas Marketing.\nCompetition in the marketplace and fluctuations in natural gas commodity prices have a direct impact on the Gas Marketing business. Changing market conditions and prices, the narrowing of regional and seasonal price differentials and limited future price volatility may adversely impact its sales margins or affect its ability to procure gas supplies and/or to serve certain customers, which may reduce sales profitability and/or increase certain credit requirements caused by reductions in netting capability. Also, Gas Marketing profitability may be impacted by the effects of the expiration, in the normal course of business, of certain of its natural gas supply contracts if those contracts cannot be replaced and/or renewed with arrangements with similar terms and pricing. Although the FERC regulates the interstate transportation of natural gas and establishes the general terms and conditions under which Spire Marketing may use interstate gas pipeline capacity to purchase and transport natural gas, Spire Marketing must occasionally renegotiate its transportation agreements with a concentrated group of pipeline companies. Renegotiated terms of new agreements, or increases in FERC-authorized rates of existing agreements, may impact Gas Marketing\u2019s future profitability. Profitability may also be adversely impacted if pipeline capacity or future storage capacity secured is not fully utilized.\nReduced access to credit and/or capital markets may prevent the Gas Marketing business from executing operating strategies.\nThe Gas Marketing segment relies on its cash flows, ability to effect net settlements with counterparties, parental guaranties, and access to Spire\u2019s liquidity resources to satisfy its credit and working capital requirements. Spire Marketing\u2019s ability to rely on parental guaranties is dependent upon Spire\u2019s financial condition and credit ratings. If Spire\u2019s credit ratings were lowered, particularly below investment grade, counterparty acceptance of parental guaranties may diminish, resulting in decreased availability of credit. Additionally, under such circumstances, certain counterparties may require Spire Marketing to provide prepayments or cash deposits, amounts of which would be dependent upon natural gas market conditions. Reduced access to credit or increased credit requirements, which may also be caused by factors such as higher overall natural gas prices, may limit Spire Marketing\u2019s ability to enter into certain transactions. In addition, Spire Marketing has concentrations of counterparty credit risk in that a significant portion of its transactions are with (or are associated with) energy producers, utility companies, and pipelines. These concentrations of counterparties have the potential to affect the Company\u2019s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that each of these three groups may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry, or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk in certain individually significant counterparties. Spire Marketing closely monitors its credit exposure and, although uncollectible amounts have not been significant, increased counterparty defaults are possible and may result in financial losses and/or capital limitations.\nRisk management policies, including the use of derivative instruments, may not fully protect Spire Marketing\u2019s sales and results of operations from volatility and may result in financial losses.\nIn the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into contracts to purchase and sell natural gas at fixed prices and index-based prices. Commodity price risk associated with these contracts has the potential to impact earnings and cash flows. To minimize this risk, Spire Marketing has a risk management policy that provides for daily monitoring of a number of business measures, including fixed price commitments.\nSpire Marketing currently manages the commodity price risk associated with fixed-price commitments for the purchase or sale of natural gas by either closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed prices or through the use of natural gas futures, options, and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. and/or the Intercontinental Exchange to lock in margins. These exchange-traded/cleared contracts may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. However, market conditions and regional price changes may cause ineffective portions of matched positions to result in financial losses. Additionally, to the extent that Spire Marketing\u2019s natural gas contracts are classified as trading activities or do not otherwise qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales designation (or the designation is not elected), the contracts are recorded as derivatives at fair value each period. Accordingly, the associated gains and losses are reported directly in earnings and may cause volatility in results of operations. Gains or losses (realized and unrealized) on certain wholesale purchase and sale contracts, consisting of those classified as trading activities, are required to be presented on a net basis (instead of a gross basis) in the statements of consolidated income. Such presentation could result in volatility in the Company\u2019s operating revenues.\nAs a natural gas market participant, Spire Marketing is subject to applicable FERC- and Commodity Futures Trading Commission- (CFTC) administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, including those directed generally to prevent manipulation of or fraud involving natural gas physical transactions and financial instruments, such as futures, options and swaps. Spire Marketing could be subject to substantial penalties and fines by FERC or CFTC, or both, for failure to comply with such rules.\nSpire Marketing\u2019s ability to meet its customers\u2019 natural gas requirements may be impaired if contracted gas supplies and interstate pipeline services are not available or delivered in a timely manner.\nSpire Marketing\u2019s ability to deliver natural gas to its customers is contingent upon the ability of natural gas producers, other gas marketers, and interstate pipelines to fulfill delivery obligations to Spire Marketing under firm contracts. To the extent that it is unable to obtain the necessary supplies, Spire Marketing\u2019s financial position and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nRegulatory and legislative developments pertaining to the energy industry may adversely impact Gas Marketing\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Gas Marketing business is non-regulated, in that the rates it charges its customers are not currently established by or subject to approval by any regulatory body with jurisdiction over its business. However, it is subject to various laws and regulations affecting the energy industry. New regulatory and legislative actions may adversely impact Gas Marketing\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows by potentially reducing customer growth opportunities and/or increasing the costs of doing business.\nGas Marketing uses bilateral contracts and derivative instruments such as futures contracts, options and swaps to hedge or mitigate ongoing commercial risks. Most standardized swaps, under the Dodd-Frank Act, are required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the CFTC\u2019s rules require companies, including Spire Marketing, to maintain regulatory records of swap transactions, and to report swaps to centralized swap data repositories, among other compliance obligations. Although Spire Marketing may qualify for exceptions to certain of these CFTC rules, its derivatives counterparties are subject to capital, margin, documentation and business conduct requirements imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. These obligations may increase transaction costs and may make it more difficult for Spire Marketing to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms or affect the number and/or creditworthiness of available swap counterparties. Spire Marketing\u2019s inability to enter into derivatives instruments or other commercial risk hedging transactions on favorable terms, or at all, could increase operating expenses and expose it to unhedged commercial risks, including potential adverse changes in commodity prices.\nThe CFTC has also recently finalized its position limits rules that modify and expand the applicability of position limits on the amounts of certain speculative futures contracts, as well as economically equivalent options, futures and swaps for or linked to certain physical commodities that market participants may hold. While Spire Marketing anticipates qualifying for a bona fide hedging exemption to certain requirements of the final rule, the CFTC\u2019s final rule and earlier adopted aggregation rules may cause Spire Marketing\u2019s hedging strategies described above to be limited if Spire Marketing is unable to qualify for an exemption.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nUnexpected losses may adversely affect Spire\u2019s or its subsidiaries\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nAs with most businesses, there are operations and business risks inherent in the activities of Spire\u2019s subsidiaries. If, in the normal course of business, Spire or any of its subsidiaries becomes a party to litigation, such litigation could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties or be resolved on unfavorable terms. In accordance with customary practice, Spire and its subsidiaries maintain insurance against a significant portion of, but not all, risks and losses. In addition, in the normal course of its operations, Spire and its subsidiaries may be exposed to loss from other sources, such as bad debt expense or the failure of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations. Spire and its operating companies employ many strategies to gain assurance that such risks are appropriately managed, mitigated, or insured, as appropriate. To the extent a loss is not fully covered by insurance or other risk mitigation strategies, that loss could adversely affect the Company\u2019s and/or its subsidiaries\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased dependence on technology may hinder Spire\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 business operations and adversely affect their financial condition and results of operations if such technologies fail.\nSpire and its subsidiaries have implemented or acquired a variety of technological tools including both Company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties. These tools and systems support critical functions including Spire and its subsidiaries\u2019 integrated planning, scheduling and dispatching of field resources, its automated meter reading system, customer care and billing, procurement and accounts payable, operational plant logistics, management reporting, and external financial reporting. The failure of these or other similarly important technologies, or the Company\u2019s or its subsidiaries\u2019 inability to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder their business operations and, to the extent not covered by insurance, could adversely impact their financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough the Company and its subsidiaries have, when possible, developed alternative sources of technology and built redundancy into their computer networks and tools, there can be no assurance that these efforts to date would protect against all potential issues related to the loss of any such technologies or the Utilities\u2019 use of such technologies.\nA cyberattack may disrupt Spire\u2019s operations or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to cybersecurity risks primarily related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive customer, employee, and vendor information maintained by the Company, its subsidiaries, or its third-party vendors in the normal course of business, as well as breaches in the technology that manages natural gas distribution operations and other business processes. A loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of technology for operations or business processes could adversely affect the Company\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 reputation, diminish customer confidence, disrupt operations, and subject the Company and its subsidiaries to possible financial liability, any of which could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company acknowledges that increased dependence on technology increases the Company\u2019s exposure to cyberattack. The Company and its subsidiaries closely monitor both preventive and detective measures to manage these risks and maintain cyber risk insurance to mitigate a significant portion, but not all, of these risks and losses. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these cyber events is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect the Company\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nResources expended to pursue or integrate business acquisitions, investments or other business arrangements may adversely affect Spire\u2019s financial position and results of operations and return on investments made may not meet the Company\u2019s expectations.\nFrom time to time, Spire may seek to grow through strategic acquisitions, investments or other business arrangements. Attractive acquisition and investment opportunities may be difficult to complete on economically acceptable terms. It is possible for Spire to expend considerable resources pursuing acquisitions and investments but, for a variety of reasons, decide not to move forward. Similarly, investment opportunities may be hindered or halted by regulatory or legal actions. To the extent that acquisitions or investments are made, such transactions involve a number of risks, including but not limited to, the assumption of material liabilities, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from daily operations, difficulties in assimilation and retention of employees, securing adequate capital to support the transaction, and regulatory approval. Uncertainties exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain businesses or assets and there is a possibility that anticipated operating and financial efficiencies expected to result from an acquisition or investment do not develop. Additionally, there are no assurances that resources expended will achieve their intended result.\nThe failure to complete an acquisition successfully or to integrate acquisitions or investments it may undertake could have an adverse effect on the Spire\u2019s financial condition and results of operations and the market\u2019s perception of the Company\u2019s execution of its strategy. To the extent Spire engages in any of the above activities together with or through one or more of its subsidiaries, including the Utilities, such subsidiaries may face the same risks.\nWorkforce risks may affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various workforce risks, including, but not limited to, the risk that it will be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel; that it will be unable to effectively transfer to new personnel the knowledge and expertise of an aging workforce as those workers retire; and that it will be unable to reach collective bargaining arrangements with the unions that represent certain of its workers, which could result in work stoppages.\nChanges in accounting standards may adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSpire and its subsidiaries are subject to changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), SEC regulations and other interpretations of financial reporting requirements for public utilities. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries have any control over the impact these changes may have on their financial condition or results of operations nor the timing of such changes. The potential issues associated with rate-regulated accounting, along with other potential changes to GAAP that the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) continues to consider may be significant.\nCatastrophic events may adversely affect the Company\u2019s facilities and operations.\nCatastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, tropical storms, terrorist acts, acts of civil unrest, pandemic illnesses or other similar occurrences could adversely affect the Utilities\u2019 facilities and operations, as well as those of Spire STL Pipeline and Spire Storage. The Utilities have emergency planning and training programs in place to respond to events that could cause business interruptions. However, unanticipated events or a combination of events, failure in resources needed to respond to events, or slow or inadequate response to events may have an adverse impact on the operations, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. The availability of insurance covering catastrophic events may be limited or may result in higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms.",

Risk Factors\u201d and \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein. In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama included in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company has two reportable segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing. Nearly all of Spire\u2019s earnings are derived from its Gas Utility segment, which reflects the regulated activities of the Utilities. Due to the seasonal nature of the Utilities\u2019 business and the Spire Missouri rate design, earnings of Spire and each of the Utilities are typically concentrated during the heating season of November through April each fiscal year.\nGas Utility - Spire Missouri\nSpire Missouri is Missouri\u2019s largest natural gas distribution utility and is regulated by the MoPSC. Spire Missouri serves St. Louis, Kansas City, and other areas throughout the state. Spire Missouri purchases natural gas in the wholesale market from producers and marketers and ships the gas through interstate pipelines into its own distribution facilities for sale to residential, commercial and industrial customers. Spire Missouri also transports gas through its distribution system for certain larger customers who buy their own gas on the wholesale market. Spire Missouri delivers natural gas to customers at rates and in accordance with tariffs authorized by the MoPSC. The earnings of Spire Missouri are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy.\nGas Utility - Spire Alabama\nSpire Alabama is the largest natural gas distribution utility in the state of Alabama and is regulated by the APSC. Spire Alabama\u2019s service territory is located in central and northern Alabama. Among the cities served by Spire Alabama are Birmingham, the center of the largest metropolitan area in the state, and Montgomery, the state capital. Spire Alabama purchases natural gas through interstate and intrastate suppliers and distributes the purchased gas through its distribution facilities for sale to residential, commercial, and industrial customers and other end-users of natural gas. Spire Alabama also transports gas through its distribution system for certain large commercial and industrial customers for a transportation fee. Effective December 1, 2020, for most of these transportation service customers, Spire Alabama will also purchase gas on the wholesale market for sale to the customer upon delivery to the Spire Alabama distribution system. All Spire Alabama services are provided to customers at rates and in accordance with tariffs authorized by the APSC.\nGas Utility - Spire EnergySouth\nSpire Gulf and Spire Mississippi are utilities engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 100,000 customers in southern Alabama and south-central Mississippi. Spire Gulf is regulated by the APSC, and Spire Mississippi is regulated by the MSPSC.\nGas Marketing\nSpire Marketing is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and related activities on a non-regulated basis and is reported in the Gas Marketing segment. Spire Marketing markets natural gas across the central and southern U.S. It holds firm transportation and storage contracts in order to effectively manage its transactions with counterparties, which primarily include producers, municipalities, electric and gas utility companies, and large commercial and industrial customers.\nOther\nOther components of the Company\u2019s consolidated information include:\n\u2022\nunallocated corporate items, including certain debt and associated interest costs;\n\u2022\nSpire STL Pipeline, a subsidiary of Spire which has constructed and, as of November 2019, operates a 65-mile FERC-regulated pipeline to deliver natural gas into eastern Missouri;\n\u2022\nSpire Storage, a subsidiary of Spire providing physical natural gas storage services; and\n\u2022\nSpire\u2019s subsidiaries engaged in the operation of a propane pipeline, the compression of natural gas, and risk management, among other activities.\nBusiness Evaluation Factors\nBased on the nature of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as current economic conditions, management focuses on several key variables in evaluating the financial condition and results of operations and managing the business.\nFor the Gas Utility segment, these include:\n\u2022\nthe Utilities\u2019 ability to recover from their customers the costs of purchasing and distributing natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe impact of weather and other factors, such as customer conservation, on revenues and expenses;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment at the federal, state, and local levels, as well as decisions by regulators, that impact the Utilities\u2019 ability to earn the authorized rate of return in each of the service territories they serve;\n\u2022\nthe Utilities\u2019 ability to access credit markets and maintain working capital sufficient to meet operating requirements;\n\u2022\nthe effect of natural gas price volatility on the business; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to manage costs, integrate and standardize operations, and upgrade infrastructure.\nIn the Gas Marketing segment, these include:\n\u2022\nthe risks of competition;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nthe changing flow and availability of natural gas;\n\u2022\nnew national infrastructure projects;\n\u2022\nthe ability to procure firm transportation and storage services at reasonable rates;\n\u2022\ncredit and/or capital market access;\n\u2022\ncounterparty risks; and\n\u2022\nthe effect of natural gas price volatility on the business.\nFurther information regarding how management seeks to manage these key variables is discussed below.\nGas Utility\nThe Utilities seek to provide reliable natural gas services at a reasonable cost, while maintaining and building secure and dependable infrastructures. The Utilities\u2019 strategies focus on improving both performance and the ability to recover their authorized distribution costs and rates of return. The Utilities\u2019 distribution costs are the essential, primarily fixed, expenditures they must incur to operate and maintain more than 60,900 miles of mains and services comprising their natural gas distribution systems and related storage facilities.\nThe Utilities\u2019 distribution costs include wages and employee benefit costs, depreciation and maintenance expenses, and other regulated utility operating expenses, excluding natural and propane gas expense. Distribution costs are considered in the rate-making process, and recovery of these types of costs is included in revenues generated through the Utilities\u2019 tariff rates. Spire Missouri\u2019s tariff rates are approved by the MoPSC, whereas Spire Alabama\u2019s tariff rates are approved by the APSC. Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi have tariff rates that are approved by the APSC and MSPSC, respectively.\nSpire Missouri and Spire Alabama also have off-system sales and capacity release income streams that are regulated by tariff but remain subject to fluctuations in market conditions. Some of the factors impacting the level of off-system sales include the availability and cost of Spire\u2019s natural gas supply, the weather in its service areas and the weather in other markets. When Spire\u2019s service areas experience warmer-than-normal weather while other markets experience colder weather or supply constraints, some of Spire\u2019s natural gas supply is available for sale to third parties not on Spire\u2019s system.\nThe Utilities work actively to reduce the impact of wholesale natural gas price volatility on their costs by strategically structuring their natural gas supply portfolios to increase their gas supply availability and pricing alternatives. They may also use derivative instruments to hedge against significant changes in the commodity price of natural gas. Nevertheless, the overall cost of purchased gas remains subject to fluctuations in market conditions. The Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clause of Spire Missouri, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi and the Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider of Spire Alabama allow the Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the public service commissions, the cost of purchased gas supplies, including costs, cost reductions and related carrying costs associated with the use of derivative instruments to mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas. As of September 30, 2020, Spire Missouri had active derivative positions, but Spire Alabama has had no gas supply derivative instrument activity since 2010. The Utilities believe they will continue to be able to obtain sufficient gas supply. The price of natural gas supplies and other economic conditions may affect sales volumes, due to the conservation efforts of customers, and cash flows associated with the timing of collection of gas costs and related accounts receivable from customers.\nThe Utilities rely on short-term credit and long-term capital markets, as well as cash flows from operations, to satisfy their seasonal cash requirements and fund their capital expenditures. The Utilities access the commercial paper market through a program administered by the holding company, which then loans borrowed funds to the Utilities. The Utilities directly access the long-term bond market. Access to debt markets is dependent on current conditions in the credit and capital markets. Management focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet and believes the Utilities currently have adequate access to credit and capital markets and will have sufficient capital resources to meet their foreseeable obligations. See the \u201cCapital Resources\u201d section for additional information.\nGas Marketing\nSpire Marketing is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and providing energy services to both on-system utility transportation customers and customers outside of the Utilities\u2019 traditional service areas. Spire Marketing utilizes its natural gas supply agreements, transportation agreements, park and loan agreements, storage agreements and other executory contracts to support a variety of services to its customers at competitive prices. It closely monitors and manages the natural gas commodity price and volatility risks associated with providing such services to its customers through the use of a variety of risk management activities, including the use of exchange-traded/cleared derivative instruments and other contractual arrangements. Spire Marketing is committed to managing commodity price risk while it seeks to expand the services that it now provides. Nevertheless, income from the Gas Marketing operations is subject to more fluctuations in market conditions than the Utilities\u2019 operations.\nThe Gas Marketing business is directly impacted by the effects of competition in the marketplace, the impacts of new infrastructure, surplus natural gas supplies, and the addition of new demand from exports, power generation and industrial load. Spire Marketing\u2019s management expects a growing need for marketing services across the country as customers manage seasonal variability and marketplace volatility.\nIn addition to its operating cash flows, Spire Marketing relies on Spire\u2019s parental guaranties to secure its purchase and sales obligations of natural gas, and it also has access to Spire\u2019s liquidity resources. A large portion of Spire Marketing\u2019s receivables are from customers in the energy industry. It also enters into netting arrangements with many of its energy counterparties to reduce overall credit and collateral exposure. On a net dollar exposure basis, the majority of Spire Marketing\u2019s customers are utilities or utility affiliates. Although Spire Marketing\u2019s uncollectible amounts are closely monitored and have not been significant, increases in uncollectible amounts from customers are possible and could adversely affect Spire Marketing\u2019s liquidity and results of operations.\nSpire Marketing carefully monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties to its transactions. It performs in-house credit reviews of potential customers and may require credit assurances such as prepayments, letters of credit or parental guaranties when appropriate. Credit limits for customers are established and monitored.\nAs a result of infrastructure optimization activities and an abundance of natural gas supply, Spire Marketing cannot be certain that all of its wholesale purchase and sale transactions will settle physically. As such, certain transactions are designated as trading activities for financial reporting purposes, due to their settlement characteristics. Results of operations from trading activities are reported on a net basis in Spire Marketing operating revenues (or expenses, if negative), which may cause volatility in the Company\u2019s operating revenues, but have no effect on operating income or net income.\nIn the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into commitments associated with the purchase or sale of natural gas. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, some of its purchase and sale transactions are not recognized in earnings until the natural gas is physically delivered, while other energy-related transactions, including those designated as trading activities, are required to be accounted for as derivatives with the changes in their fair value (representing unrealized gains or losses) recorded in earnings in periods prior to settlement. Because related transactions of a purchase and sale strategy may be accounted for differently, there may be timing differences in the recognition of earnings under GAAP and economic earnings realized upon settlement. The Company reports both GAAP and net economic earnings (non-GAAP), as discussed in the section \u201cNon-GAAP Measures\u201d.\nCOVID-19\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions worldwide. We are continuing to assess the developments involving our workforce, customers and suppliers, as well as the response of federal and state authorities, our regulators and other business and community leaders. The Company has implemented what we believe to be appropriate procedures and protocols to ensure the safety of our customers, suppliers and employees. These actions include activating incident management procedures, work-from-home for our office-based employees, limiting direct contact with our customers, and, through June, suspending disconnections and late payment fees for our utility customers.\nWe have experienced impacts on our results of operations from COVID-19. Based upon our analysis, the effects through September 30, 2020, included:\n\u2022\nlost late payment fees of $2.3 due to a Missouri moratorium from late March through mid-June;\n\u2022\nminor net margin impact from lower commercial and industrial volumes offset by additional residential fixed charges;\n\u2022\nbad debt expense increases of $4.8 due to the aging of our accounts receivable balances; and\n\u2022\nnet other direct cost reductions totaling less than $1.0 due to lower travel, meals and entertainment and training offset by increased costs for enhanced cleaning and personal protective equipment for our facilities and field personnel compared to normal and expected levels.\nSpire Missouri received an Accounting Authority Order from the MoPSC to defer certain costs and has recorded a related regulatory asset of $3.8 as of September 30, 2020. Even with the cost increases and lost revenues, Spire Alabama exceeded the allowed return and recorded a Rate Stabilization and Equalization giveback in September 2020, so there was no bottom-line impact of these COVID-19 effects.\nAn extended slowdown of the United States' economy, changes in commodity costs and/or significant changes in policy and regulation could result in lower demand for natural gas as well as negatively impact the ability of our customers, contractors, suppliers and other business partners to remain in business or return to operating health. These could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.\nThe Company is participating in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) provisions allowing for a payroll tax deferral which will not have an impact on our results of operations but will defer the payment of the Company\u2019s portion of certain payroll taxes until fiscal 2021 and 2022. Although the Company does not currently expect to seek relief under any other CARES Act provisions, we will continue to monitor all pending and future federal, state and local efforts related to the COVID-19 health crisis and assess our need and, as applicable, eligibility for any such relief.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nNet income, earnings per share and operating income reported by Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama are determined in accordance with GAAP. Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama also provide the non-GAAP financial measures of net economic earnings, net economic earnings per share and contribution margin. Management and the Board of Directors use non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting, to determine incentive compensation and to evaluate financial performance. These non-GAAP operating metrics should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, the related GAAP measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided on the following pages.\nNet Economic Earnings and Net Economic Earnings Per Share\nNet economic earnings and net economic earnings per share are non-GAAP measures that exclude from net income the impacts of fair value accounting and timing adjustments associated with energy-related transactions, the impacts of acquisition, divestiture and restructuring activities, and the largely non-cash impacts of impairments and other non-recurring or unusual items such as certain regulatory, legislative or GAAP standard-setting actions. In fiscal 2018, these other items included the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the write-off of certain long-standing assets as a result of disallowances in Spire Missouri\u2019s rate proceedings. In fiscal 2019, other items included a provision for refunds to customers of amounts previously collected under MoPSC approved orders as a result of the November 2019 ISRS rulings against Spire Missouri. In fiscal 2020, adjustments for ISRS revenues reflect the regulatory settlement reached in the third quarter, such that the related GAAP provision for customer credit for fiscal 2020 is reflected in net economic earnings. In addition, net economic earnings per share excludes the impact, in the fiscal year of issuance, of shares issued to finance acquisitions that have yet to be included in net economic earnings.\nThe fair value and timing adjustments are made in instances where the accounting treatment differs from what management considers the economic substance of the underlying transaction, including the following:\n\u2022\nNet unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivatives that are required by GAAP fair value accounting associated with current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. These unrealized gains and losses result primarily from two sources:\n1)\nchanges in the fair values of physical and/or financial derivatives prior to the period of settlement; and\n2)\nineffective portions of accounting hedges, required to be recorded in earnings prior to settlement, due to differences in commodity price changes between the locations of the forecasted physical purchase or sale transactions and the locations of the underlying hedge instruments;\n\u2022\nLower of cost or market adjustments to the carrying value of commodity inventories resulting when the net realizable value of the commodity falls below its original cost, to the extent that those commodities are economically hedged; and\n\u2022\nRealized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of economic hedges prior to the sale of the physical commodity.\nThese adjustments eliminate the impact of timing differences and the impact of current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded in each period until being replaced with the actual gains or losses realized when the associated physical transactions occur. Management believes that excluding the earnings volatility caused by recognizing changes in fair value prior to settlement and other timing differences associated with related purchase and sale transactions provides a useful representation of the economic effects of only the actual settled transactions and their effects on results of operations. While management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate all of its businesses, the net effect of these fair value and timing adjustments on the Utilities\u2019 earnings is minimal because gains or losses on their natural gas derivative instruments are deferred pursuant to state regulation.\nContribution Margin\nIn addition to operating revenues and operating expenses, management also uses the non-GAAP measure of contribution margin when evaluating results of operations. Contribution margin is defined as operating revenues less natural and propane gas costs and gross receipts tax expense. The Utilities pass to their customers (subject to prudence review by, as applicable, the MoPSC, APSC or MSPSC) increases and decreases in the wholesale cost of natural gas in accordance with their PGA clauses or GSA riders. The volatility of the wholesale natural gas market results in fluctuations from period to period in the recorded levels of, among other items, revenues and natural gas cost expense. Nevertheless, increases and decreases in the cost of gas associated with system gas sales volumes and gross receipts tax expense (which are calculated as a percentage of revenues), with the same amount (excluding immaterial timing differences) included in revenues, have no direct effect on operating income. Therefore, management believes that contribution margin is a useful supplemental measure, along with the remaining operating expenses, for assessing the Company\u2019s and the Utilities\u2019 performance.\nEARNINGS\nThis section contains discussion and analysis of the results for the year ended September 30, 2020 compared to the results for the year ended September 30, 2019 and discussion and analysis of the results for the year ended September 30, 2019 compared to the results for the year ended September 30, 2018.\nSpire\nNet Income (Loss) and Net Economic Earnings (Loss)\nThe following tables reconcile the Company\u2019s net economic earnings to the most comparable GAAP number, net income.\n*\nIncome tax effect is calculated by applying federal, state and local income tax rates applicable to ordinary income to the amounts of the pre-tax reconciling items and then adding any estimated effects of enacted state or local income tax laws for periods before the related effective date.\n**\nNet economic earnings per share is calculated by replacing consolidated net income with consolidated net economic earnings in the GAAP diluted earnings per share calculation, which includes reductions for cumulative preferred dividends and participating shares.\n2020 vs. 2019\nConsolidated\nSpire\u2019s net income was $88.6 in fiscal 2020, compared with $184.6 in fiscal 2019. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.44 for fiscal 2020 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $3.53 and $3.52, respectively, for fiscal 2019. The decrease in net income of $96.0 reflects a $148.6 pre-tax ($117.3 after-tax) reduction in the current year due to impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of this year. The impairment charges are further described under \u201cImpairment of Long-lived Assets\u201d in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. These impairment charges were only partly offset by the $12.2 pre-tax ($9.3 after-tax) reduction in the prior year results due to ISRS rulings against Spire Missouri.\nExcluding these amounts, net income growth was $12.0, driven by higher operating results of the Gas Utility segment primarily attributable to Spire Missouri\u2019s higher ISRS charges, and RSE adjustment impacts at Spire Alabama.\nThe Gas Marketing segment\u2019s net income for fiscal 2020 was $7.0, an $11.5 reduction versus the comparable prior-year period, reflecting primarily the cost of storage positions as noted below.\nNet economic earnings were $207.8 ($3.76 per diluted share) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, up from $195.1 ($3.73 per diluted share) for the same period last year. Earnings reflect a $13.6 increase for Gas Utility, and by a $9.4 lower net economic loss in Other, partly offset by a $10.3 net economic earnings decrease experienced by Gas Marketing. These fluctuations are described in more detail below. Earnings per share and net economic earnings per share reflect the impact of preferred and common stock issued over the last twelve months.\nGas Utility\nGas Utility net income increased by $23.1, while net economic earnings increased $13.6 in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Both measures benefited from a $20.2 increase in run rate ISRS revenues in the current year, combined with a $1.1 pre-tax increase in all other factors, including modest customer growth. These positive drivers of income growth were only partly offset by a $5.4 contribution margin reduction in the current year relating to lower volumes, and a COVID-19-related $2.3 reduction in late payment charges. Net income was also impacted by the $10.0 year-over-year favorable impact relating to the provision for and settlement of the ISRS Rulings that occurred in late fiscal 2019 and were resolved in fiscal 2020.\nGas Marketing\nThe Gas Marketing segment reported net income totaling $7.0 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, versus net income of $18.5 during the same period last year. Net economic earnings for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, was $9.1, a decrease of $10.3 from the same period last year. Both net income and net economic earnings reflect the costs incurred in 2020 for incremental storage capacity (whose value will not be realized until 2021), as well as less favorable market conditions.\nOther\nThe Company\u2019s other non-utility activities generated a net loss of $132.0 for fiscal 2020, compared to a net loss of $24.4 for the same period last year. Fiscal 2020 reflects the $117.3 after-tax impairment charge previously mentioned. Net economic loss was $14.7 for fiscal 2020, a decrease of $9.4 compared to fiscal 2019. The improvement was driven by a smaller loss from Spire Storage and an increase in earnings from Spire STL Pipeline.\nOperating Revenues and Operating Expenses\nReconciliations of contribution margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are shown below.\nConsolidated\nSpire\u2019s operating revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 were $97.0 lower than the same period in the prior year. Operating revenues decreased by $108.8 at the Gas Utility segment and were $4.2 and $36.3 higher in the Gas Marketing segment and Other, respectively. Intercompany eliminations increased $28.7 year-over-year, principally related to STL Pipeline. The Gas Utility decrease was due principally to lower gas cost recoveries, weather/volumetric impacts (net of weather mitigation), lower gross-receipts tax, and lower off-system sales that were only partly offset by higher ISRS, and Spire Alabama RSE adjustment impacts. The Gas Marketing increase was primarily due to higher volumes that offset the impact of slightly lower pricing. The increase in intercompany eliminations was driven by the STL Pipeline transportation services to Spire Missouri.\nSpire\u2019s contribution margin increased $55.0 compared with the same twelve-month period last year. The growth in contribution margin was primarily attributable to the Gas Utility segment, up $33.6, with Spire Missouri up $23.4 and Spire Alabama up $6.5, with remaining growth from the utilities of Spire EnergySouth. Gas Marketing\u2019s contribution margin was down $13.2, reflecting the costs of incremental storage and transportation capacity that will benefit the upcoming winter heating season. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the Gas Utility segment, driven principally by continued infrastructure investment in both Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama. Gas Utility operation and maintenance (\u201cO&M\u201d) expenses were lower in the current year driven primarily by lower bad debt expense, operations and employee-related costs. These fluctuations are described in more detail below.\nGas Utility\nOperating Revenues - Gas Utility operating revenues for fiscal 2020 decreased $108.8 compared to fiscal 2019, and was attributable to the following factors:\nAs shown in the table above, the decrease in revenues was driven primarily by a $96.8 reduction in gas cost recoveries, $35.8 attributable to volumetric usage, lower gross receipt taxes of $7.8, and a $7.1 impact due to lower Spire Missouri off-system sales. These impacts were only partly offset by an increase of $30.2 in ISRS ($20.2 of the increase relating to run rate, with the remaining $10.0 increase attributable to the favorable year-over-year impact of the ISRS Rulings provision and subsequent settlement), a $4.9 increase relating to Spire Alabama\u2019s RSE adjustments, and $3.6 attributable to all other factors.\nContribution Margin - Gas Utility contribution margin was $1,000.7 for fiscal 2020, a $33.6 increase over the same period last year. The increase was attributable to the following factors:\nThe increase was primarily attributable to the $30.2 increase in Spire Missouri ISRS ($20.2 of the increase relating to run rate, with the remaining $10.0 increase attributable to the favorable year-over-year impact of the ISRS Rulings provision and subsequent settlement). Contribution margin also benefited from a $3.8 increase relating to Spire Alabama\u2019s RSE net adjustments, and $7.3 attributable to multiple smaller factors, including modest customer growth. These positive impacts were only partly offset by a $5.4 volumetric/weather reduction (net of weather mitigation) and a $2.3 COVID-19-related reduction in late payment fee revenue in Spire Missouri.\nOperating Expenses - O&M expenses in fiscal 2020 decreased by $20.4 million compared to the prior-year period. Current year expenses reflect a $9.1 million year-over-year reclassification of certain postretirement benefit costs to other income and expense (no impact on net income). Excluding this adjustment, O&M expenses decreased by $11.3 million due to lower bad debt expense, operations and employee-related costs. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 increased $10.3 from the same period last year, principally the result of continued infrastructure capital spending, with $6.5 of the increase attributable to Spire Missouri and $3.1 attributable to Spire Alabama.\nGas Marketing\nOperating Revenues - Gas Marketing operating revenue for the year ended September 30, 2020 increased $4.2 from the prior year. The variance in revenues reflects higher total volumes, partly offset by the impact of marginally lower general pricing levels and slightly unfavorable derivative mark-to-market activity.\nContribution Margin - Gas Marketing contribution margin was $22.4 for fiscal 2020, a $13.2 decrease compared to the same period last year. Excluding the net impact of fair value adjustments in both periods totaling $1.6, the net year-over-year decline was $11.6. This reflects the costs associated with storage positions entered into in the second half of 2020 whose value will not be realized until the upcoming winter heating season in fiscal 2021, as well as less favorable market conditions.\nOther\nOther operating revenue increased $36.3 for the year ended September 30, 2020 compared to 2019, driven principally by STL Pipeline that was placed in service in November of 2019. Other operating expenses were $6.6 higher than the prior year reflecting STL Pipeline, combined with higher activity levels at Spire Storage.\nInterest Charges\nConsolidated interest charges during the year ended September 30, 2020 increased $1.1 versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by net long-term debt issuances in the current year and the prior year benefiting from Allowance for Funds Used in Construction (AFUDC) non-cash income at STL Pipeline. The current year also benefited from lower interest rates and stable levels of average short-term borrowings. Short-term rates averaged 1.7% in the current year versus 2.7% for the prior year and, for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, average short-term borrowings were $576.2 and $574.5, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nConsolidated income tax expense during the year ended September 30, 2020 was $12.4, compared to $34.5 for fiscal 2019. This decrease of $22.1 is primarily the result of the $31.3 tax benefit relating to the impairment loss recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. This benefit was only partly offset by the effects of higher pre-tax book income (excluding the restructuring charge) in the current year.\nSpire Missouri\nSummary Operating Results\nOperating revenues during the year ended September 30, 2020 decreased $98.2 from the same period last year. The decrease in revenues was driven primarily by a $92.6 reduction in gas cost recoveries, $22.0 attributable to lower volumetric usage, lower gross receipt taxes of $7.4, and a $7.1 impact due to lower off-system sales. These impacts were only partly offset by an increase of $30.2 in ISRS ($20.2 of the increase relating to run rate, with the remaining $10.0 increase attributable to the favorable year-over-year impact of the ISRS Rulings provision and subsequent settlement), and $2.9 attributable to customer growth primarily due to a lower level of disconnections related to COVID-19.\nContribution margin for the year ended September 30, 2020 increased $23.4 from the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to the $32.2 increase in Spire Missouri ISRS, as previously identified above. These positive impacts were only partly offset by a $7.4 volumetric/weather reduction (net of weather mitigation) and a $2.3 COVID-19-related reduction in late payment fee revenue in Spire Missouri.\nO&M expenses for the year ended September 30, 2020 were $17.1 lower than the prior year. Removing the $8.6 net year-over-year impact due to the transfer of mix of service and non-service postretirement benefits costs to other income and expense, O&M decreased $8.5 due to lower operations and employee-related costs. Depreciation and amortization increased $6.5, reflecting continued infrastructure investments throughout Missouri. Income taxes were $4.0 higher for the year ended September 30, 2020 versus the prior year. This increase is primarily the result of higher pre-tax book income, partly offset by a favorable return to provision in the current year.\nTemperatures experienced in Spire Missouri\u2019s service area during fiscal 2020 were 9% warmer than the prior year and 2% warmer than normal. Total system therms sold and transported were 1,684.0 million for fiscal 2020 compared with 1,805.7 million for fiscal 2019, a decrease of 7%. Total off-system therms sold and transported outside of Spire Missouri\u2019s service area decreased 21% to 30.6 million for fiscal 2020 compared with 38.5 million for fiscal 2019.\nSpire Alabama\nSummary Operating Results\nOperating revenues for the year ended September 30, 2020 decreased $10.5 versus the comparable period ended September 30, 2019. Of the decrease, $13.8 was the result of weather and usage impacts, and $4.2 related to lower gas cost recoveries. Partly offsetting these negative impacts was a $4.9 increase relating to the impacts of RSE adjustments, and $2.5 relating to off-system sales that commenced in fiscal 2020.\nContribution margin increased $6.5 versus the prior year, primarily the result of RSE adjustments of approximately $3.8, a $2.0 increase due to weather/volumetric impacts (net of weather mitigation), and $0.8 relating to off-system sales.\nO&M expenses for the year ended September 30, 2020 decreased $3.5 versus the year ended September 30, 2019. Removing the $0.8 net year-over-year impact due to the transfer of mix of service and non-service postretirement benefits costs to other income and expense, O&M was down $2.7 from the prior year. The O&M decrease was due to due to lower operations and employee-related costs, and a benefit associated with a bad debt charge in fiscal 2019 that did not repeat and was partially recovered. Depreciation and amortization was $3.1 higher versus the same period last year, the result of continued infrastructure investment throughout Spire Alabama\u2019s service territory.\nInterest expense decreased $1.1. The decrease was primarily driven by net long-term debt issuances with lower rates, and lower rates and levels of short-term borrowings. Income tax expense is $1.5 higher than the prior year, primarily the result of higher pre-tax book income.\nTemperatures in Spire Alabama\u2019s service area during the year ended September 30, 2020 were 13% warmer than last year, and approximately 17% warmer than historical norms. Spire Alabama\u2019s total therms sold and transported were 1,034.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2020, compared with 1,083.1 million last year, a 4% decrease. In fiscal 2020 Spire Alabama commenced off-system sales and achieved total sales of 54.3 therms in the current year.\n2019 vs. 2018\nConsolidated\nSpire\u2019s net income was $184.6 in fiscal 2019, compared with $214.2 in fiscal 2018. Basic and diluted earnings per share were $3.53 and $3.52, respectively, for fiscal 2019 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $4.35 and $4.33, respectively, for fiscal 2018. The decrease in net income of $29.6 reflects a $12.2 pre-tax ($9.3 after-tax) reduction in the current year due to ISRS rulings against Spire Missouri, and a $60.1 prior year income benefit relating to the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), partly offset by $38.4 in pre-tax ($23.6 after-tax) expense for Missouri rate case write-offs recorded in the prior year.\nExcluding these amounts, net income growth was $16.2, driven by higher operating results of the Gas Utility segment primarily attributable to Spire Missouri\u2019s new rate design, higher ISRS charges, higher volumes, and customer growth.\nThe Gas Marketing segment also experienced strong operating results, as the benefits of geographic expansion have mostly offset the return of more normal market conditions and higher operating expenses.\nNet economic earnings were $195.1 ($3.73 per diluted share) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, up from $183.7 ($3.72 per diluted share) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2018. Earnings reflect a $16.7 increase for Gas Utility, partly offset by a $3.5 net economic earnings decrease experienced by Gas Marketing and by a $1.8 higher net economic loss in Other. These fluctuations are described in more detail below. Earnings per share and net economic earnings per share were further impacted by the issuance of 2.3 million common shares in May 2018, and the dividends earned from the $250.0 in preferred shares issued in May 2019. Dividends earned on cumulative preferred shares are deducted from net income in the calculation of earnings per share.\nGas Utility\nGas Utility net income increased by $46.1, while net economic earnings increased $16.7 in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Both measures benefited from the 2018 rate case redesign at Spire Missouri, and from weather patterns that were favorable compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2019 net income was negatively impacted by $9.3 in after-tax impacts relating to ISRS rulings against Spire Missouri. Fiscal 2018 net income was negatively impacted by the $23.6 after-tax expense related to Missouri rate case write-offs and by a $17.0 one-time tax expense related to the implementation of the TCJA.\nGas Marketing\nThe Gas Marketing segment reported net income totaling $18.5 for fiscal 2019, versus net income of $24.9 during fiscal 2018, with 2018 benefitting from favorable fair value mark-to-market valuations and unusually favorable market conditions. Net economic earnings for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, was $19.4, a decrease of $3.5 from the twelve months ended September 30, 2018 as the benefits of geographic expansion were more than offset by a return of more normal market conditions and higher operating expenses.\nOther\nThe Company\u2019s other non-utility activities generated a net loss of $24.4 for fiscal 2019, compared to net income of $44.9 for fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2018 reflects a $78.2 tax benefit resulting from the implementation of the TCJA, partly offset by higher acquisition and restructuring activities. Net economic loss was $24.1 for fiscal 2019, an increase of $1.8 compared to fiscal 2018. The increased loss reflects higher corporate interest costs and a $15.4 loss from Spire Storage, partially offset by increased allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) income for Spire STL Pipeline.\nOperating Revenues and Operating Expenses\nConsolidated\nSpire\u2019s operating revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 were $12.6 lower than for the twelve months ending September 30, 2018. Operating revenues decreased by $27.6 at the Gas Utility segment and were $12.1 higher in the Gas Marketing segment. The Gas Utility decrease was due principally to lower gas cost recoveries, rate case TCJA customer givebacks, impacts at Spire Missouri relating to ISRS rulings, and weather/volumetric impacts (net of volume mitigation) that were only partly offset by Missouri rate design changes, higher ISRS, and favorable Spire Alabama Rate Stabilization and Equalization (RSE) renewal and giveback. The Gas Marketing increase was primarily due to higher volumes that offset the impact of slightly lower pricing.\nSpire\u2019s contribution margin increased $17.9 compared with the same twelve-month period last year. The growth in contribution margin was primarily attributable to the Gas Utility segment, up $19.6, with Spire Missouri up $11.0 and Spire Alabama up $7.0, with remaining growth from the utilities of Spire EnergySouth. Gas Marketing\u2019s contribution margin was down $5.7, reflecting a decline in basis differentials that was only partly offset by higher volumes combined with geographic expansion. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the Gas Utility segment, driven principally by continued infrastructure investment in both Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama. Gas Utility operation and maintenance (\u201cO&M\u201d) expenses were lower in the current year driven primarily by the Missouri rate case write-offs in the prior year. These fluctuations are described in more detail below.\nGas Utility\nOperating Revenues - Gas Utility operating revenues for fiscal 2019 decreased $27.6 compared to fiscal 2018, and was attributable to the following factors:\nAs shown in the table above, the decrease in revenues was driven primarily by a $30.2 reduction in gas cost recoveries, rate case TCJA customer givebacks totaling $24.3, $12.4 attributable to volumetric usage, and a $12.2 impact due to ISRS rulings. These impacts were only partly offset by an increase of $32.2 relating to the rate design changes at Spire Missouri, an increase in ISRS of $8.7, a $4.6 increase relating to Spire Alabama\u2019s RSE renewal and giveback, and $2.7 attributable to customer growth.\nContribution Margin -- Gas Utility contribution margin was $967.1 for fiscal 2019, a $19.6 increase over the same period last year. The increase was attributable to the following factors:\nThe increase was primarily attributable to the $32.2 increase resulting from the 2018 Missouri rate cases resets. Contribution margin also benefited from $8.7 higher ISRS charges, $5.1 due to volumes and colder weather in the current year (net of weather mitigation), a $4.6 increase relating to Spire Alabama\u2019s RSE renewal and giveback, and $2.7 attributable to customer growth. These positive impacts were only partly offset by rate case TCJA customer givebacks totaling $24.3 from both Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, and $12.2 relating to ISRS rulings against Spire Missouri.\nOperating Expenses - Gas Utility O&M expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 decreased $8.0 from last year. Removing last year\u2019s $38.4 of Missouri rate case write-offs, and the $19.6 net year-over-year increase due to the transfer of mix of service and non-service postretirement benefits costs to other income and expense, O&M increased $10.8. Of this increase, $9.0 relates to higher employee benefits and energy efficiency costs that resulted from the 2018 Missouri rate cases. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 increased $12.4 from the same period last year principally the result of continued infrastructure capital spending, with $8.7 of the increase attributable to Spire Missouri and $3.0 attributable to Spire Alabama.\nGas Marketing\nOperating Revenues - Gas Marketing operating revenue for the year ended September 30, 2019 increased $12.1 from the prior year. The variance in revenues reflects the effect of a $9.3 favorable mark-to-market adjustment on derivatives combined with higher total volumes, partly offset by the impact of marginally lower general pricing levels. Average commodity pricing for the year ended September 30, 2019 was approximately $2.670/MMBtu versus approximately $2.681/MMBtu for fiscal 2018, a decrease of $0.011/MMBtu.\nContribution Margin - Gas Marketing contribution margin was $35.6 for fiscal 2019, a $5.7 decrease compared to the same period last year. This reflects geographic expansion that created additional opportunities to optimize the segment\u2019s supply, transportation and storage portfolio that was more than offset by a return to more normal market conditions, reflected in the narrowed basis differentials in the current year.\nOther\nOther operating revenue increased $5.0 for the year ended September 30, 2019 compared to 2018, driven principally by gas storage revenues and slightly higher reinsurance premiums. Other operating expenses were $1.3 higher than the prior year primarily due to gas storage operations.\nInterest Charges\nConsolidated interest charges during the year ended September 30, 2019 increased $6.0 versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by net long-term debt issuances and higher rates and levels of short-term borrowings. Short-term rates averaged 2.7% in the current year versus 2.0% for the prior year and, for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, average short-term borrowings were $574.5 and $408.6, respectively. Partly offsetting these factors was an increase in the non-cash AFUDC income for Spire STL Pipeline compared to the prior year.\nIncome Taxes\nConsolidated income tax expense during the year ended September 30, 2019 was $34.5, compared to a $26.5 tax benefit for fiscal 2018. This increase of $61.0 is primarily the result of the $60.1 fiscal 2018 revaluation benefit of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet that were not reflected in net economic earnings. The remaining increase in income tax is primarily the result of the effects of higher pre-tax book income in the current year, partly offset by an increase in amortization of excess deferred income taxes.\nSpire Missouri\nSummary Operating Results\nOperating revenues during the year ended September 30, 2019 increased $6.2 from the same period last year. Revenues were impacted primarily by the $9.4 increase attributable to the new rate design (net of TCJA giveback), combined with higher ISRS charges of $8.7, and customer growth of $2.7. These positive impacts on the revenue growth were partly offset by $12.2 in impacts relating to ISRS rulings and volume impacts (net of weather mitigation) of $3.6.\nContribution margin for the year ended September 30, 2019 increased $11.0 from the prior year. Contribution margin benefited from the $9.4 increase attributable to the new rate design (net of TCJA giveback), combined with higher ISRS charges of $8.7, customer growth of $2.7, and the $2.8 increase due to the combined impacts of volumetric usage and higher off-system sales. These positive impacts were only partly offset by the $12.2 in adjustments relating to the ISRS rulings.\nO&M expenses for the year ended September 30, 2019 were $11.0 lower than the prior year. Removing last year\u2019s $38.4 of Missouri rate case write-offs, and the $16.9 net year-over-year increase due to the transfer of mix of service and non-service postretirement benefits costs to other income and expense, O&M increased $10.5. Of this increase, $9.0 relates to higher employee benefits and energy efficiency costs that resulted from the 2018 Missouri rate cases. Depreciation and amortization increased $8.7, reflecting continued infrastructure investments throughout Missouri. Interest expense in the current year was $2.8 greater than prior year, the result of higher short-term borrowings and higher average effective interest rates. Income taxes were $45.9 higher for the year ended September 30, 2019 versus the prior year. This increase is primarily the result of the $45.2 fiscal 2018 revaluation benefit of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.\nTemperatures experienced in Spire Missouri\u2019s service area during fiscal 2019 were 5% colder than the prior year and 8% colder than normal. Total system therms sold and transported were 1,805.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared with 1,759.8 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of 3%. Total off-system therms sold and transported outside of Spire Missouri\u2019s service area decreased 44% to 38.5 million for fiscal 2019 compared with 68.6 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease in off-system therms was the direct result of the increase in demand experienced for system therms.\nSpire Alabama\nSummary Operating Results\nOperating revenues for the year ended September 30, 2019 decreased $35.2 versus the comparable period ended September 30, 2018. Of the decrease, $27.8 related to lower gas cost recoveries, $8.8 was the result of weather and usage impacts, $1.7 was attributable to lower gross receipt taxes, along with approximately $1.5 associated with rate reductions to customers due to tax savings from the TCJA. Partly offsetting these negative impacts was a $4.6 increase relating to favorable RSE renewal and giveback.\nContribution margin increased $7.0 versus the prior year, as a favorable RSE adjustment of approximately $4.6 and a $3.9 increase due to weather/volumetric impacts (net of weather mitigation) were only slightly offset by the $1.5 impact of the customer rate reduction resulting from the TCJA.\nO&M expenses for the year ended September 30, 2019 increased $3.8 versus the year ended September 30, 2018. Removing the $2.4 net year-over-year increase due to the transfer of mix of service and non-service postretirement benefits costs to other income and expense, O&M increased $1.4. Depreciation and amortization was $3.0 higher versus the same period last year, the result of continued infrastructure investment throughout Spire Alabama\u2019s service territory.\nInterest expense increased $4.4. The increase was primarily driven by net long-term debt issuances and higher rates and levels of short-term borrowings. Income tax expense is $61.1 lower than the prior year, primarily the result of 2018 being burdened with the $60.7 deferred tax revaluation impact resulting from the implementation of the TCJA.\nTemperatures in Spire Alabama\u2019s service area during the year ended September 30, 2019 were 6% warmer than last year, and approximately 6% warmer than historical norms. Spire Alabama\u2019s total therms sold and transported were 1,083.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2019, compared with 1,020.8 million last year, a 6% increase.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nFor discussions of regulatory matters for Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama, see Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nThe Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have evaluated or are in the process of evaluating the impact that recently issued accounting standards will have on their financial position or results of operations upon adoption. For disclosures related to the adoption of new accounting standards, see the New Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nINFLATION\nThe accompanying financial statements reflect the historical costs of events and transactions, regardless of the purchasing power of the dollar at the time. Due to the capital-intensive nature of the businesses of the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, the most significant impact of inflation is on the depreciation of utility plant. Rate regulation, to which the Utilities are subject, allows recovery through its rates of only the historical cost of utility plant as depreciation. The Utilities expect to incur significant capital expenditures in future years, primarily related to the planned increased replacements of distribution plant. The Utilities believe any higher costs experienced upon replacement of existing facilities will be recovered through the normal regulatory process.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment and estimates in preparing our financial statements:\nRegulatory Accounting - The Utilities account for their regulated operations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 980, Regulated Operations. The provisions of this accounting guidance require, among other things, that financial statements of a rate-regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators, where appropriate. These actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non-rate-regulated enterprises. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates. Also, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities). Management believes that the current regulatory environment supports the continued use of these regulatory accounting principles and that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process. For Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, management believes the following represent the more significant items recorded through the application of this accounting guidance:\nPGA Clause - Spire Missouri\u2019s PGA clauses allows it to flow through to customers, subject to a prudence review by the MoPSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies, including the costs, cost reductions and related carrying costs associated with the use of natural gas derivative instruments to hedge the purchase price of natural gas. The difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the PGA clauses are recorded as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities that are recovered or refunded in a subsequent period. The PGA clauses also permit the application of carrying costs to all over- or under-recoveries of gas costs, including costs and cost reductions associated with the use of derivative instruments, and also provide for a portion of income from off-system sales and capacity release revenues to be flowed through to customers.\nGSA Rider - Spire Alabama\u2019s rate schedules for natural gas distribution charges contain a GSA rider, established in 1993, which permits the pass-through to customers of changes in the cost of gas supply. Spire Alabama\u2019s tariff provides a temperature adjustment mechanism, also included in the GSA, that is designed to moderate the impact of departures from normal temperatures on Spire Alabama\u2019s earnings. The temperature adjustment applies primarily to residential, small commercial and small industrial customers. Other non-temperature weather related conditions that may affect customer usage are not included in the temperature adjustment. In prior years, Spire Alabama entered into cash flow derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on its gas supply. Spire Alabama recognizes all derivatives at fair value as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. Any realized gains or losses are passed through to customers using the mechanisms of the GSA rider in accordance with Spire Alabama\u2019s APSC approved tariff and are recognized as a\nregulatory asset or regulatory liability. All derivative commodity instruments in a gain position are valued on a discounted basis incorporating an estimate of performance risk specific to each related counterparty. Derivative commodity instruments in a loss position are valued on a discounted basis incorporating an estimate of performance risk specific to Spire Alabama. Spire Alabama currently has no active gas supply derivative positions.\nISRS -The ISRS allows Spire Missouri expedited recovery for its investment to upgrade its infrastructure and enhance its safety and reliability without the necessity of a formal rate case. Spire Missouri records ISRS revenues as authorized by the MoPSC and estimates the probability and amount of any refunds based on commission precedent, current legal rulings, the opinion of legal counsel, and other considerations.\nEmployee Benefits and Postretirement Obligations - Pension and postretirement obligations are calculated by actuarial consultants that utilize several statistical factors and other assumptions provided by management related to future events, such as discount rates, returns on plan assets, compensation increases, and mortality rates. For the Utilities, the amount of expense recognized and the amounts reflected in other comprehensive income are dependent upon the regulatory treatment provided for such costs, as discussed further below. Certain liabilities related to group medical benefits and workers\u2019 compensation claims, portions of which are self-insured and/or contain \u201cstop-loss\u201d coverage with third-party insurers to limit exposure, are established based on historical trends.\nThe amount of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs recognized in the financial statements related to the Utilities\u2019 qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans is based upon allowances, as approved by the MoPSC (for Spire Missouri) and as approved by the APSC (for Spire Alabama). The allowances have been established in the rate-making process for the recovery of these costs from customers. The differences between these amounts and actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs incurred for financial reporting purposes are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. GAAP also requires that changes that affect the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans, but that are not yet required to be recognized as components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs, be reflected in other comprehensive income. For the Utilities\u2019 qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, amounts that would otherwise be reflected in other comprehensive income are deferred with entries to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities.\nThe tables below reflect the sensitivity of Spire\u2019s plans to potential changes in key assumptions:\n*\nExcludes the impact of regulatory deferral mechanism. See Note 13, Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 for information regarding the regulatory treatment of these costs.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets - Long-lived assets classified as held and used are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Whether impairment has occurred is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets with the carrying value of the assets. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the Company recognizes an impairment charge equal to the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. In the period in which the Company determines an asset meets held-for-sale criteria, an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the book value exceeds its fair value less cost to sell.\nOn July 1, 2020, Spire\u2019s Board of Directors, based upon the recommendation of senior management, revised the development plan for Spire Storage, resulting in an impairment charge of $140.8 related to Spire Storage assets in the quarter ended June 30, 2020. The revision was driven by the realization that a longer time horizon will be required for optimization and positioning of the storage facility to serve energy markets in the western United States. Among other factors, evaluations of the continuing evolution of market dynamics in the region led management to update models of various development alternatives. Separately in the quarter ended June 30, 2020, Spire recorded impairment charges totaling $7.8 related to two commercial compressed natural gas fueling stations as a result of revised projections reflecting lower diesel prices and slower conversions of Class 8 vehicles. The fair values used in measuring the impairment charges were determined with an expected present value technique using a discounted cash flow method under an income approach. Our impairment loss calculations required management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate fair values of the assets. This involved estimating cash flows, useful lives, and current market value for similar assets and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. Cash flow projections were based on assumptions about future market demand and achievement of certain operational capabilities. Assumptions were selected from a range of reasonably possible amounts and were supported by relevant and reliable data. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to additional impairments that could be material. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate asset impairment losses.\nIncome Taxes - Income tax calculations require estimates due to book-tax differences, estimates with respect to regulatory treatment of certain items, and uncertainty in the interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Critical assumptions and judgments also include projections of future taxable income to determine the ability to utilize net operating losses and credit carryforwards prior to their expiration. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management regularly assesses financial statement tax provisions to identify any change in regulatory treatment or tax related estimates and assumptions that could have a material impact on cash flows, financial position and/or results of operations.\nFor further discussion of significant accounting policies, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nLIQUIDITY\nThe Company\u2019s short-term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder months when the Utilities borrow money to cover the lag between when they purchase natural gas and when their customers pay for that gas. Changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas (including cash payments for margin deposits associated with Spire Missouri\u2019s use of natural gas derivative instruments), variations in the timing of collections of gas cost under the Utilities\u2019 PGA clauses and GSA riders, the seasonality of accounts receivable balances, and the utilization of storage gas inventories cause short-term cash requirements to vary during the year and from year to year, and may cause significant variations in the Company\u2019s cash provided by or used in operating activities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $19.0 from 2019 to 2020 and decreased $5.7 from 2018 to 2019, primarily as a result of fluctuations in working capital items.\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company used $206.7 less cash in investing activities than in fiscal 2019. The major driver of the reduction was lower capital expenditures, down $184.9 versus the prior year. Spire STL Pipeline, which was placed into service in the first fiscal quarter of 2020, accounted for $97.4 of the reduction, and expenditures at Spire Storage were $59.6 below prior year levels. Capital expenditures at the Utilities were down $29.1, while remaining focused on infrastructure upgrades and new business development. Utility capital expenditures resume growth in fiscal 2021 and beyond, while total Company capital expenditures are planned to be $590.o for fiscal 2021.\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company used $306.6 more cash in investing activities than in 2018. Capital expenditures increased $323.9 from fiscal 2018 to 2019, primarily as a result of $110.5 higher expenditures for the Spire STL Pipeline project and a $118.9 increase in infrastructure upgrades, new business development and investment to support customer growth across Missouri and Alabama. A further $89.9 in expenditures related to the development of Spire Storage.\nNet cash provided by financing activities declined $211.8 in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019, the major driver being the prior year issuance of preferred stock that generated $242.0 in proceeds. Year-over-year net debt issuance increased by $32.3, and the issuance of common stock generated $21.6 more cash in fiscal 2020 than in fiscal 2019. These increases in cash were only partly offset by a $20.4 increase in common and preferred stock dividends in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $282.7 from 2018 to 2019. The increase in 2019 versus 2018 was primarily due to the issuance of preferred shares for $242.0 and an increase in net debt issuance of $189.2. These increases were only partly offset by the $135.2 reduction in funds received from common stock issuances in 2019 versus 2018.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company\u2019s, Spire Missouri\u2019s and Spire Alabama\u2019s access to capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs, may depend on the credit rating of the entity that is accessing the capital markets. Their debt is rated by two rating agencies: Standard & Poor\u2019s Corporation (\u201cS&P\u201d) and Moody\u2019s Investors Service (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d). As of September 30, 2020, the debt ratings of the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, shown in the following table, remain at investment grade with a stable outlook.\nIt is management\u2019s view that the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have adequate access to capital markets and will have sufficient capital resources, both internal and external, to meet anticipated capital requirements, which primarily include capital expenditures, interest payments on long-term debt, scheduled maturities of long-term debt, short-term seasonal needs and dividends.\nThe effects of COVID-19 on the U.S. capital markets may significantly impact Spire. We rely on access to the capital markets to fund our capital requirements. These uncertain economic conditions may also result in the inability of our customers to pay for services and could have an impact on our liquidity. Still, considering our financing as described in Note 7, Notes Payable and Credit Agreements, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8, we believe we have sufficient access to cash to meet our needs.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nBank deposits were used to support working capital needs of the business. Spire had no temporary cash investments as of September 30, 2020 or 2019. Due to lower yields available to Spire on short-term investments, the Company elected to provide all of Spire Missouri\u2019s and Spire Alabama\u2019s short-term funding through intercompany lending during the past fiscal year.\nShort-term Debt\nThe Utilities\u2019 short-term borrowing requirements typically peak during the colder months, while most of the Company\u2019s other needs are less seasonal. These short-term cash requirements can be met through the sale of commercial paper or through the use of a revolving credit facility. For information about these resources, see Note 7, Notes Payable and Credit Agreements, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 and \u201cInterest Rate Risk\u201d under \u201cMarket Risk\u201d below.\nLong-term Debt and Equity\nAt September 30, 2020, including the current portion but excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, Spire had long-term debt totaling $2,500.0, of which $1,098.0 was issued by Spire Missouri, $475.0 was issued by Spire Alabama, and $237.0 was issued by other subsidiaries. For more information about long-term debt, see Note 6 of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 and \u201cInterest Rate Risk\u201d under \u201cMarket Risk\u201d below.\nOn November 12, 2019, Spire Missouri issued and sold to certain institutional purchasers in a private placement $275.0 of 2.84% first mortgage bonds due November 15, 2029. Interest is payable semi-annually. The bonds are secured by a mortgage and deed of trust and rank equal in right to payment with all Spire Missouri\u2019s other first mortgage bonds. Spire Missouri used the proceeds to repay its $100.0 floating-rate note and for other general corporate purposes.\nOn December 2, 2019, Spire Alabama issued and sold to certain institutional investors in a private placement $100.0 of 2.88% Series 2019B Senior Notes due December 1, 2029. Interest is payable semi-annually. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of Spire Alabama and rank equal in right to payment with all its other senior unsecured indebtedness. Spire Alabama used the proceeds to repay short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.\nOn December 23, 2019, Spire STL Pipeline issued and sold notes to certain institutional investors in a $135.0 private placement. Interest is payable semi-annually at 2.95%, and principal repayment is scheduled annually in accordance with a 15-year amortization schedule with an average life of 9.2 years. Proceeds were used to repay short-term debt.\nOn June 16, 2020, Spire Missouri purchased and cancelled a portion of its outstanding first mortgage bonds, including $5.7 of its 7% bonds due 2029, $0.8 of its 6% bonds due 2034, $0.5 of its 6.15% bonds due 2036, and $0.1 of its 4.625% bonds due 2043.\nSpire Missouri was authorized by the MoPSC to issue registered securities (first mortgage bonds, unsecured debt and preferred stock), common stock, and private placement debt in an aggregate amount of up to $500.0 for financings placed any time before September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2020, $125.0 remained available under this authorization. Spire Alabama has no standing authority to issue long-term debt and must petition the APSC for each planned issuance. On March 24, 2020, the APSC approved an application for up to $150.0 of additional long-term debt financing.\nSpire has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the issuance and sale of up to 250,000 shares of common stock under its Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan. There were 207,254 and 201,148 shares at September 30, 2020 and November 16, 2020, respectively, remaining available for issuance under this Form S-3. Spire and Spire Missouri also have a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC for the issuance of various equity and debt securities, which expires on May 14, 2022.\nOn February 6, 2019, Spire entered into an \u201cat-the-market\u201d equity distribution agreement, supplemented as of May 14, 2019, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $150.0. Those shares are issued pursuant to Spire\u2019s universal shelf registration statement referenced above and a prospectus supplement dated May 14, 2019. Under this program, in the year ended September 30, 2020, Spire issued 446,619 shares, generating $32.0 of proceeds net of issuance costs, and in the year ended September 30, 2019, Spire issued 179,630 shares, generating $14.4 of proceeds net of issuance costs.\nOn May 21, 2019, Spire issued 5.90% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, resulting in $242.0 of proceeds net of issuance costs.\nIncluding the current portion of long-term debt, the Company\u2019s long-term consolidated capitalization at September 30, 2020, consisted of 50% equity, compared to 55% equity at September 30, 2019. For more information about equity, see Note 5 of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nAs of September 30, 2020, Spire had contractual obligations with payments due as summarized below:\n(a)\nIncludes interest payments over the terms of the debt. Interest is calculated using the applicable interest rate and outstanding principal for each instrument with the terms ending at each instrument\u2019s stated maturity. See Note 6, Long-Term Debt, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\n(b)\nLease obligations are primarily for office space and power operated equipment. Additional payments will be incurred if renewal options are exercised under the provisions of certain agreements.\n(c)\nThese purchase obligations represent the minimum payments required under existing natural gas transportation and storage contracts and natural gas supply agreements in the Gas Utility and Gas Marketing segments. These amounts reflect fixed obligations as well as obligations to purchase natural gas at future market prices, calculated using September 30, 2020 forward market prices. Each of the Utilities generally recovers costs related to its purchases, transportation and storage of natural gas through the operation of its PGA clause or GSA rider, subject to prudence review by the appropriate regional public service commission. Variations in the timing of collections of gas costs from customers may affect short-term cash requirements. Additional contractual commitments are generally entered into prior to or during the heating season.\n(d)\nThese purchase obligations primarily reflect miscellaneous agreements for the purchase of materials and the procurement of services necessary for normal operations.\n(e)\nLong-term liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits, totaling $13.2, have been excluded from the table above because the timing of future cash outflows, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated. Also, commitments related to pension and postretirement benefit plans have been excluded from the table above. The Company expects to contribute $47.8 to its qualified, trusteed pension plans and $0.6 to its non-qualified pension plans during fiscal 2021. With regard to the postretirement benefits, the Company anticipates it will contribute $2.0 to the qualified trusts and $0.5 directly to participants from Spire Missouri funds during fiscal 2021. For further discussion of the Company\u2019s pension and postretirement benefit plans, refer to Note 13, Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nThe Utilities and other Spire subsidiaries own and operate natural gas distribution, transmission and storage facilities, the operations of which are subject to various environmental laws, regulations and interpretations. While environmental issues resulting from such operations arise in the ordinary course of business, such issues have not materially affected the Company\u2019s, Spire Missouri\u2019s or Spire Alabama\u2019s financial position and results of operations. As environmental laws, regulations and their interpretations change, however, the Company and the Utilities may be required to incur additional costs. For information relative to environmental matters, see Contingencies in Note 16 of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAt September 30, 2020, the Company had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements, other than surety bonds, and letters of credit entered into in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not expect to engage in any significant off-balance sheet financing arrangements in the near future.\nMARKET RISK\nCommodity Price Risk\nGas Utility\nThe Utilities\u2019 commodity price risk, which arises from market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, is primarily managed through the operation of Spire Missouri\u2019s PGA clauses and Spire Alabama\u2019s GSA rider. The PGA clauses and GSA rider allows the Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC and APSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies. Spire Missouri is allowed the flexibility to make up to three discretionary PGA changes during each year, in addition to its mandatory November PGA change, so long as such changes are separated by at least two months. Spire Missouri is able to mitigate, to some extent, changes in commodity prices through the use of physical storage supplies and regional supply diversity. The Utilities also have risk management policies that allow for the purchase of natural gas derivative instruments with the goal of managing its price risk associated with purchasing natural gas on behalf of its customers. These policies prohibit speculation. As of September 30, 2020, Spire Missouri had active natural gas derivative positions, but Spire Alabama did not. Costs and cost reduction, including carrying costs, associated with the use of natural gas derivative instruments are allowed to be passed on to customers through the operation of the PGA clauses or GSA rider. Accordingly, the Utilities do not expect any adverse earnings impact as a result of the use of these derivative instruments. However, the timing of recovery for cash payments related to margin requirements may cause short-term cash requirements to vary. For more information about the Utilities\u2019 natural gas derivative instruments, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nGas Marketing\nIn the course of its business, Spire\u2019s non-regulated gas marketing subsidiary, Spire Marketing, enters into contracts to purchase and sell natural gas at fixed prices and natural gas index-based prices. Commodity price risk associated with these contracts has the potential to impact earnings and cash flows. To minimize this risk, Spire Marketing has a risk management policy that provides for daily monitoring of a number of business measures, including fixed price commitments. In accordance with the risk management policy, Spire Marketing manages the price risk associated with its fixed price commitments. This risk is currently managed either by closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed-prices or through the use of natural gas futures, options and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to lock in margins. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, Spire Marketing\u2019s unmatched fixed-price positions were not material to Spire\u2019s financial position or results of operations.\nAs mentioned above, Spire Marketing uses natural gas futures, options and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the NYMEX and ICE to manage the commodity price risk associated with its fixed-price natural gas purchase and sale commitments. These derivative instruments may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases or sales. Such accounting treatment, if elected, generally permits a substantial portion of the gain or loss to be deferred from recognition in earnings until the period that the associated forecasted purchase or sale is recognized in earnings. To the extent a hedge is effective, gains or losses on the derivatives will be offset by changes in the value of the hedged forecasted transactions. Information about the fair values of Spire Marketing\u2019s exchange-traded/cleared natural gas derivative instruments is presented below:\nCertain of Spire Marketing\u2019s physical natural gas derivative contracts are designated as normal purchases or normal sales, as permitted by GAAP. This election permits the Company to account for the contract in the period the natural gas is delivered. Contracts not designated as normal purchases or normal sales, including those designated as trading activities, are accounted for as derivatives with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the periods prior to settlement.\nBelow is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for physical natural gas contracts accounted for as derivatives, none of which will settle beyond fiscal 2022:\nFor further details related to Spire Marketing\u2019s derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nCounterparty Credit Risk\nSpire Marketing has concentrations of counterparty credit risk in that a significant portion of its transactions are with energy producers, utility companies and pipelines. These concentrations of counterparties have the potential to affect the Company\u2019s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that each of these three groups may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk with certain individually significant counterparties. To the extent possible, Spire Marketing enters into netting arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate exposure to credit risk. It is also exposed to credit risk associated with its derivative contracts designated as normal purchases and normal sales. Spire Marketing closely monitors its credit exposure and, although uncollectible amounts have not been significant, increased counterparty defaults are possible and may result in financial losses and/or capital limitations. For more information on these and other concentrations of credit risk, including how Spire Marketing manages these risks, see Note 11, Concentrations of Credit Risk, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk associated with its short-term debt issuances. Based on average short-term borrowings during fiscal 2020, an increase of 100 basis points in the underlying average interest rate for short-term debt would have caused an increase in interest expense (and a decrease in pre-tax earnings and cash flows) of approximately $5.8 on an annual basis. Portions of such an increase may be offset through the Utilities\u2019 application of PGA and GSA carrying costs. At September 30, 2020, Spire had fixed-rate long-term debt totaling $2,500.0. Spire Missouri had fixed-rate long-term debt totaling $1,098 and Spire Alabama had fixed-rate long-term debt of $475.0, all included in Spire\u2019s total long-term debt. While the long-term debt issues are fixed-rate, they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change. However, increases or decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Company were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity. Under GAAP applicable to the Utilities\u2019 regulated operations, losses or gains on early redemptions of long-term debt would typically be deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and amortized over a future period.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company entered into a three-year interest rate swap with a fixed interest rate of 3.250% and a notional amount of $100.0 to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates on future interest rate payments. The Company recorded a $53.7 mark-to-market loss to comprehensive income on this swap for twelve months ended September 30, 2020. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company entered into multiple interest rate swaps with fixed interest rates ranging from 0.921% to 1.3105% for a total notional amount of $150.0 to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates on future interest rate payments. The Company recorded a $0.5 mark-to-market loss to comprehensive income for these swaps for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020.\nRefer to Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional details on the Company\u2019s interest rate swap transactions.",

Interim Financial Information (Unaudited)\nManagement Reports on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nSpire Inc.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. Spire Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nSpire Inc.\u2019s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of Spire Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2020, of the Company and our report dated November 18, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nNovember 18, 2020\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Spire Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Spire Inc. and subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 18, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRegulatory Matters - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 15 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company accounts for their regulated operations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 980, Regulated Operations. The provisions of this accounting guidance require, among other things, that financial statements of a rate-regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators, where appropriate. These actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non-rate-regulated enterprises. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates. Also, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities).\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Missouri, Alabama, and Mississippi Public Service Commissions (the \u201cCommissions\u201d), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of natural gas companies within their respective geographies. The Company has stated that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process.\nAccounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items, including property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; and depreciation expense, and affects multiple disclosures in the Company\u2019s financial statements. There is a risk that the Commissions will not approve full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. As a result, we identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of current and future regulatory orders on events that have occurred as of September 30, 2020, and the judgments made by management to support their assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures. Management judgments included assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs or (2) refunds to customers or future reduction in rates. Given that management\u2019s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these rate-impacted account balances and disclosures, and the related judgments, requires specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation due to the inherent complexities associated with the specialized rules related to accounting for the effects of cost-based regulation.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n\u2022\nWe tested the effectiveness of management\u2019s controls over evaluating the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of management\u2019s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n\u2022\nWe evaluated the Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments, in the financial statements.\n\u2022\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company in Missouri, Alabama, and Mississippi; regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, and filings made by interveners; and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions\u2019 treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.\n\u2022\nWe obtained from management the regulatory orders that support the probability of recovery, refund, and/or future reduction in rates for regulatory assets and liabilities and assessed management\u2019s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.\nEvaluation of Spire Storage Asset Impairment - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company evaluates for impairment long-lived assets classified as held and used when events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the respective asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. The carrying value of the asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable, the Company recognizes an impairment charge equal to the amount of the carrying value of the asset that exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $140.8 million related to their Spire Storage West LLC (\u201cStorage\u201d) long-lived assets (the \u201casset group\u201d) after it was determined that their carrying value was not recoverable due to a revision in future business development plans. The Company measured the impairment loss by estimating the fair value of the asset group using a discounted cash flow model (the \u201cmodel\u201d). The estimation of fair value required management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group under various business development plans, future market demand, operational capabilities, and the selection of a discount rate. Significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period.\nWe identified the estimation of the fair value of the Storage asset group as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of auditor judgment and an increased level of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s assumptions in determining the fair value, including those related to revenue forecasts and the \u201cterminal value\u201d used to determine estimated future cash flows under various business development plans, and the selection of a discount rate.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the estimation of the fair value of the Storage asset group included the following, among others:\n\u2022\nWe tested the effectiveness of management\u2019s controls over the Storage asset impairment evaluation, including those over the key assumptions used in the estimation of the fair value of the asset group, including revenue forecasts, terminal value, and selection of a discount rate.\n\u2022\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of key assumptions used by management in the fair value determination by:\no\nComparing revenue and cash flow projections to current executed contracts, capital improvement plans, and third-party reports about future market demand,\no\nComparing assumed operational capabilities to internal development plans and third-party reports about asset viability,\no\nComparing the various development plans considered to internal communications to management and the Board of Directors,\no\nComparing estimated terminal value to comparable precedent transactions involving external parties, and\no\nPerforming sensitivity analyses of the key assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value estimate that would result from changes in the assumptions.\n\u2022\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management\u2019s assumptions involving revenue forecasts by determining if the revenue forecasts were consistent with:\no\nExecuted storage contracts,\no\nThird-party reports regarding future market demand, value of contracts, and operational capabilities of the Storage sites, and\no\nVarious business development plans communicated to management and the Board of Directors of Spire Inc.\n\u2022\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management\u2019s assumptions involving terminal value by determining whether the terminal value was consistent with comparable precedent transactions involving external parties.\n\u2022\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow model by:\no\nTesting the mathematical accuracy of the model, and\no\nEvaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate used in the model by developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nNovember 18, 2020\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1953.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholder and the Board of Directors of Spire Missouri Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Spire Missouri Inc.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION - These notes are an integral part of the accompanying audited financial statements of Spire Inc. (\u201cSpire\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) presented on a consolidated basis, Spire Missouri Inc. (\u201cSpire Missouri\u201d) and Spire Alabama Inc. (\u201cSpire Alabama\u201d). Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama are wholly owned subsidiaries of Spire. Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth Inc. (\u201cSpire EnergySouth\u201d) are collectively referred to as the \u201cUtilities.\u201d The subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth are Spire Gulf Inc. and Spire Mississippi Inc. Unless otherwise indicated, references to years herein are references to the fiscal years ending September 30 for the Company and its subsidiaries.\nThe accompanying audited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Spire include the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries. Transactions and balances between consolidated entities have been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements of Spire. In compliance with GAAP, transactions between Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama and their affiliates, as well as intercompany balances on their balance sheets, have not been eliminated from their separate financial statements.\nNATURE OF OPERATIONS - Spire has two reportable segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing. The Gas Utility segment consists of the regulated natural gas distribution operations of the Company and is the core business segment of Spire in terms of revenue and earnings. The Gas Utility segment is comprised of the operations of: Spire Missouri, serving St. Louis, Kansas City, and other areas in Missouri; Spire Alabama, serving central and northern Alabama; and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth, serving the Mobile, Alabama area and south-central Mississippi. The Gas Marketing segment includes Spire\u2019s primary gas-related business, Spire Marketing Inc. (\u201cSpire Marketing\u201d), which provides non-regulated natural gas services, primarily in the central and southern United States (U.S.). The activities of other subsidiaries are reported as Other and are described in Note 14, Information by Operating Segment. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama each have a single reportable segment.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSYSTEM OF ACCOUNTS - The accounts of the Utilities are maintained in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the applicable state public service commissions, which systems substantially conform to that prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).\nPROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT -\nUtility Plant - Utility plant is stated at original cost. The cost of additions to utility plant includes contracted work, direct labor and materials, allocable overheads and an allowance for funds used during construction. The costs of units of property retired, replaced or renewed are removed from utility plant and are charged to accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs of property and replacement and renewal of items determined to be less than units of property are charged to maintenance expenses.\nFor Spire Missouri, utility plant is depreciated on a straight-line basis at rates based on estimated service lives of the various classes of property. In fiscal year 2020, the average depreciation and amortization expense averaged 2.9%, while in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, annual depreciation and amortization expense averaged 3.0% of the original cost of depreciable and amortizable property.\nFor Spire Alabama, depreciation is provided using the composite method of depreciation on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of utility property at rates approved by the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC). The composite depreciation rate in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately 3.1%.\nNon-utility Property - Non-utility property is recorded at the original cost of acquisition or construction, which includes material, labor, contractor services and, for FERC-regulated projects, an allowance for funds used during construction. Repairs, replacements and renewals of items of property determined to be less than a unit of property or that do not increase the property\u2019s life or functionality are charged to maintenance expense. Upon retirement or sale of non-utility property, the original cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the income statements. Costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related software. If software is retired prior to being fully amortized, the difference is recorded as a loss in the income statements.\nAccrued Capital Expenditures - Accrued capital expenditures, shown in the following table, are excluded from capital expenditures in the statements of cash flows until paid.\nASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS - Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama record legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets in the period in which the obligations are incurred, if sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligations. Obligations are recorded as both a cost of the related long-lived asset and as a corresponding liability. Subsequently, the asset retirement costs are depreciated over the life of the asset and the asset retirement obligations are accreted to the expected settlement amounts. The Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama record asset retirement obligations associated with certain safety requirements to purge and seal gas distribution mains upon retirement, the plugging and abandonment of storage wells and other storage facilities, specific service line obligations, and certain removal and disposal obligations related to components of Spire Missouri\u2019s, Spire Alabama\u2019s and Spire Gulf\u2019s distribution systems and general plant. Asset retirement obligations recorded by Spire\u2019s other subsidiaries are not material. As authorized by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC) and APSC, Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and Spire Gulf accrue future asset removal costs associated with their property, plant and equipment even if a legal obligation does not exist. Such accruals are provided for through depreciation expense and are recorded with corresponding credits to regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets. When those utilities retire depreciable utility plant and equipment, they charge the associated original costs to accumulated depreciation and amortization, and any related removal costs incurred are charged to regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets. The difference between removal costs recognized in depreciation rates and the accretion expense and depreciation expense recognized for financial reporting purposes is a timing difference between recovery of these costs in rates and their recognition for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, these differences are deferred as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets. In the rate setting process, the regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets are excluded from the rate base upon which those utilities have the opportunity to earn their allowed rates of return.\nIn fiscal 2020, Spire Alabama refined certain assumptions and estimates used in calculating its asset retirement obligations, resulting in both an increase in cost to retire gas distribution assets and a change in the timing of the related cash outflows. As a result of this change in estimate, which the Company believes is more precise, Spire Alabama recorded a $221.1 increase to its asset retirement obligations. Related adjustments were made to regulatory assets and utility plant, with no impact on earnings. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of asset retirement obligations at September 30, as reported in the balance sheets.\nREGULATED OPERATIONS - The Utilities account for their regulated operations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 980, Regulated Operations. This topic sets forth the application of GAAP for those companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third-party regulator. The provisions of this accounting guidance require, among other things, that financial statements of a regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators, where appropriate. These actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non-regulated enterprises. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates. In addition, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities). Management believes that the current regulatory environment supports the continued use of these regulatory accounting principles and that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process. See additional discussion on regulated operations in Note 15, Regulatory Matters.\nNATURAL GAS AND PROPANE GAS - For Spire Missouri\u2019s eastern region, inventory of natural gas in storage is priced on a last in, first out (LIFO) basis and inventory of propane gas in storage is priced on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis. For the rest of the Gas Utility segment, inventory of natural gas in storage is priced on the weighted average cost basis. The replacement cost of Spire Missouri\u2019s natural gas for current use in eastern Missouri at September 30, 2020, and September 30, 2019, was less than the LIFO cost by $12.5 and $17.0, respectively. The carrying value of the Utilities\u2019 inventory is never adjusted to a lower net realizable value or market value because, pursuant to Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clauses or a Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider, actual gas costs are recovered in customer rates. Natural gas and propane gas storage inventory in Spire\u2019s other operating segments is recorded at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS - Spire\u2019s acquisitions were accounted for using business combination accounting. Under this method, the purchase price paid by the acquirer is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date based on their fair value.\nIn December 2017, the Company acquired an 80% voting interest in a natural gas storage facility in Wyoming. The transaction was valued at $24.8, consisting of $16.0 in cash and a $10.0 non-interest-bearing note valued at $8.8. In October 2018, the Company completed the exercise of its right to call the remaining 20% voting interest in that facility and settled the related note for a combined total of $17.0. In May 2018, the Company expanded its operations by acquiring 100% of a neighboring natural gas storage facility for $12.2 in cash. Together, these storage operations are referred to herein as \u201cSpire Storage.\u201d\nGOODWILL - Goodwill is measured as the excess of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred over the amount of acquisition-date identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities. At September 30, 2020, goodwill included in Spire\u2019s Gas Utility and Gas Marketing segments was $210.2 and zero, respectively, with the remainder held at the corporate level. Goodwill amounts have not changed since fiscal 2017, and there are no accumulated impairment losses. Spire and Spire Missouri evaluate goodwill for impairment as of July 1 of each year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. At July 1, 2020 and 2019, Spire and Spire Missouri conducted qualitative assessments and determined goodwill was not impaired. The Company updated the assessments as of September 30, 2020, determining that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.\nIMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS - Long-lived assets classified as held and used are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Whether impairment has occurred is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets with the carrying value of the assets. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the Company recognizes an impairment charge equal to the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. In the period in which the Company determines an asset meets held-for-sale criteria, an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the book value exceeds its fair value less cost to sell.\nOn July 1, 2020, Spire\u2019s Board of Directors, based upon the recommendation of senior management, revised the development plan for Spire Storage, resulting in an impairment charge of $140.8 related to Spire Storage assets (non-utility property on the balance sheet) in the quarter ended June 30, 2020. The revision was driven by the realization that a longer time horizon will be required for optimization and positioning of the storage facility to serve energy markets in the western United States. Among other factors, evaluations of the continuing evolution of market dynamics in the region led management to update models of various development alternatives. Separately in the quarter ended June 30, 2020, Spire recorded impairment charges totaling $7.8 related to two commercial compressed natural gas fueling stations (also non-utility property) as a result of revised projections reflecting lower diesel prices and slower conversions of Class 8 vehicles. The fair values used in measuring the impairment charges were determined with an expected present value technique using a discounted cash flow method under an income approach.\nDERIVATIVES - In the course of their business, certain subsidiaries of Spire enter into commitments associated with the purchase or sale of natural gas. Certain of their derivative natural gas contracts are designated as normal purchases or normal sales and, as such, are excluded from the scope of FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Those contracts are accounted for as executory contracts and recorded on an accrual basis. Revenues and expenses from such contracts are recorded gross. Contracts not designated as normal purchases or normal sales are recorded as derivatives with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the periods prior to physical delivery. Certain of Spire Marketing\u2019s wholesale purchase and sale transactions are classified as trading activities for financial reporting purposes. Under GAAP, revenues and expenses associated with trading activities are presented on a net basis in Gas Marketing operating revenues (or expenses, if negative) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. This net presentation has no effect on operating income or net income. Refer to Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, for more information about derivatives.\nINCOME TAXES - Spire and its subsidiaries account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax basis and for tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. The effects on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in enacted tax rates is recognized in income or loss for non-regulated operations, and in a regulatory asset or regulatory liability for regulated operations. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with authoritative guidance. The authoritative guidance addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed, or expected to be claimed, on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Spire may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits of the position. Tax-related interest and penalties, if any, are classified as a liability on the balance sheets. For additional information on the accounting for income taxes, refer to Note 12, Income Taxes.\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH - All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. Such instruments are carried at cost, which approximates market value. Outstanding checks on the Company\u2019s and Utilities\u2019 bank accounts in excess of funds on deposit create book overdrafts (which are funded at the time checks are presented for payment) and are classified as Other in the Current Liabilities section of the balance sheets. Changes in book overdrafts are reflected as Operating Activities in the statements of cash flows. In Spire\u2019s statements of cash flows, total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash included $17.0 of restricted cash reported in \u201cOther\u201d current assets on Spire\u2019s balance sheet as of September 30, 2018 (in addition to amounts shown as \u201cCash and cash equivalents\u201d). This restricted cash was an escrow deposit for the purchase of the remaining 20% interest in a natural gas storage business and the settlement of the related note payable, and the transaction was completed on October 25, 2018.\nNATURAL GAS RECEIVABLE - Spire Marketing enters into natural gas transactions with natural gas pipeline and storage companies known as park and loan arrangements. Under the terms of the arrangements, Spire Marketing purchases natural gas from a third party and delivers that natural gas to the pipeline or storage company for the right to receive the same quantity of natural gas from that company at the same location in a future period. These arrangements are accounted for as non-monetary transactions under GAAP and are recorded at the carrying amount. As such, natural gas receivables are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost, which includes related fees associated with the transactions. In the period that the natural gas is returned to Spire Marketing, concurrent with the sale of the natural gas to a third party, the related natural gas receivable is expensed in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In conjunction with these transactions, Spire Marketing usually enters into New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) natural gas futures, options, and swap contracts or fixed price sales agreements to protect against market changes in future sales prices.\nEARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE - GAAP requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS). EPS is computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method for computing EPS that treats a participating security as having rights to earnings that would otherwise have been available to common shareholders. Certain of the Company\u2019s stock-based compensation awards pay non-forfeitable dividends to the participants during the vesting period and, as such, are deemed participating securities. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding that are increased for additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive non-participating securities were converted to common shares, pursuant to the treasury stock method. Shares attributable to equity units, non-participating stock options and time-vested restricted stock/units are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the effect would be antidilutive. Shares attributable to non-participating performance-contingent restricted stock awards are only included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share to the extent the underlying performance and/or market conditions are satisfied (a) prior to the end of the reporting period or (b) would be satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related contingency period and the result would be dilutive. The Company\u2019s EPS computations are presented in Note 4, Earnings Per Common Share.\nTRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES - Transactions between affiliates of the Company have been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements of Spire. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama borrowed funds from the Company and incurred related interest, as reflected in their separate financial statements, and they participated in normal intercompany shared services transactions. In addition, Spire Missouri\u2019s other transactions with affiliates included:\nIn the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, Spire Alabama had natural gas purchases from and sales to Spire Marketing totaling $6.3 and $0.3, respectively.\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS - Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the amounts due from customers, including unbilled amounts. Estimates of the collectability of trade accounts receivable are based on historical trends, age of receivables, economic conditions, credit risk of specific customers, and other factors. Accounts receivable are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are deemed to be uncollectible.\nFINANCE RECEIVABLES - Spire Alabama finances third party contractor sales of merchandise including gas furnaces and appliances. At September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, Spire Alabama\u2019s finance receivable totaled approximately $9.4 and $11.7, respectively. Financing is available only to qualified customers who meet creditworthiness thresholds for customer payment history and external agency credit reports. Spire Alabama relies upon ongoing payments as the primary indicator of credit quality during the term of each contract. The allowance for credit losses is recognized using an estimate of write-off percentages based on historical experience. Delinquent accounts are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and, absent evidence of debt repayment, after 90 days are due in full and assigned to a third-party collection agency. The remaining finance receivable is written off approximately 12 months after being assigned to the third-party collection agency. Spire Alabama had finance receivables past due 90 days or more of $0.3 at September 30, 2020 and $0.4 at September 30, 2019.\nGROUP MEDICAL AND WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION RESERVES - The Company self-insures its group medical and workers\u2019 compensation costs and carries stop-loss coverage in relation to medical claims and workers\u2019 compensation claims. Reserves for amounts incurred but not reported are established based on historical cost levels and lags between occurrences and reporting.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS - Certain assets and liabilities are recognized or disclosed at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.\nThe levels of the hierarchy are described below:\n\u2022\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\u2022\nLevel 2 - Pricing inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability as of the reporting date. These inputs are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.\n\u2022\nLevel 3 - Pricing that is based upon inputs that are generally unobservable that are based on the best information available and reflect management\u2019s assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability.\nAssessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements may require judgment and may affect the valuation of the asset or liability and its placement within the fair value hierarchy. Additional information about fair value measurements is provided in Note 8, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Note 9, Fair Value Measurements, and Note 13, Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION - The Company accounts for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The Company measures stock-based compensation awards at fair value at the date of grant and recognizes the compensation cost of the awards over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are recognized in the period they occur. Refer to Note 3, Stock-Based Compensation, for further discussion of the accounting for the Company\u2019s stock-based compensation plans.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama adopted the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and related amendments (collectively, \u201cASC 606\u201d), in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts at October 1, 2018. The core principle of ASC 606 is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new standard, an entity must identify the performance obligations in a contract, determine the transaction price and allocate the price to specific performance obligations to recognize revenue when the obligation is completed. In addition, ASC 606 requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in no change to how Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama recognize revenue, and therefore, no cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings was required, and there was no significant impact to financial results after adoption. The adoption did result in changes to the disclosures about revenue, which are included in Note 2, Revenue. Some revenue arrangements, such as alternative revenue programs and certain derivative contracts, are excluded from the scope of ASC 606 and, therefore, are presented separately in disclosures.\nAlso effective October 1, 2018, Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, with no material impact on interim or annual financial statements. The amended guidance requires that the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs be presented within the same line item in the income statement as other compensation costs (except for the amount being capitalized), while other components are to be presented outside the subtotal of operating income and are no longer eligible for capitalization (e.g., as part of utility plant). The amended guidance is applied retrospectively for income statement presentation and prospectively for capitalization. The Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama elected the practical expedient permitting the use of the amounts disclosed in its pension and other postretirement benefit plan note for the prior comparative periods as the estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirements. Accordingly, for the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama reclassified net benefit costs (income) of $14.4, $17.2 and $(2.0), respectively, from \u201coperation and maintenance\u201d to \u201cother income (expense), net.\u201d For Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama, and the Company\u2019s other rate-regulated entities, all components of net benefit cost have historically been recovered from customers as a component of utility plant and will continue to be recovered in the same manner over the depreciable lives of the related plant assets; therefore, for those entities, the components that are no longer eligible to be capitalized as a component of plant under GAAP are reported as regulatory assets.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This guidance permits companies to make an election to reclassify stranded income tax effects from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCI), to retained earnings. The Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama adopted this guidance in the quarter ended September 30, 2018, and the related reclassifications are shown on the statements of shareholders\u2019 equity of the Company and Spire Missouri. There was no effect for Spire Alabama.\nThe Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, along with related ASU Nos. 2018-01, 2018-10, 2018-11, 2018-20 and 2019-01 (collectively, \u201cASC 842\u201d), using a modified retrospective transition method for leases existing at, or entered into after, October 1, 2019. Under the selected transition method, comparative periods in the financial statements are presented under ASC 840 (previous lease accounting guidance). ASC 842 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for almost all lease contracts based on the present value of lease payments. It provides new guidelines for identifying and classifying a lease, and classification affects the pattern and income statement line item for the related expense. The Company and its subsidiaries elected a package of three practical expedients permitted by the standard, allowing them not to reassess existing contracts for (1) whether it is or contains a lease, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. They also elected to use the benefit of hindsight in determining both the lease term and impairments associated with any existing leases, which resulted in lease terms that best represent management\u2019s expectations with respect to use of the underlying asset but did not result in recognition of any impairment. Finally, they elected not to assess whether existing land easements are leases under ASC 842. The adoption of ASC 842 impacted the balance sheets through recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases but did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment or significant impacts to income or cash flows. For other lease policy elections and disclosures about leases, see Note 17, Leases.\nSpire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama adopted the guidance in ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, and related ASU Nos. 2018-16, 2019-04, and 2019-10 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. The amendments in these ASUs more closely align the results of hedge accounting with risk management activities through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results in the financial statements. They did not have a significant impact on the financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which was later supplemented by ASU Nos. 2018-19, 2019-04, 2019-05 and 2019-11. The standard replaces the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d model with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model for certain instruments, including trade receivables, requiring measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. It also requires entities to record credit loss allowances for available-for-sale securities rather than impair the carrying amount of the securities. Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama will initially apply the new standard for the quarter ending December 31, 2020, using a modified retrospective method of adoption. Based on the credit quality of the existing available-for sale securities portfolio, no allowance for credit losses will be recognized at adoption for those investments. The ASU did not result in any significant modifications to the Company\u2019s policies related to recognizing an allowance on trade receivables, and the adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on Spire\u2019s, Spire Missouri\u2019s and Spire Alabama\u2019s financial statements.\nRECLASSIFICATIONS - Spire\u2019s consolidated statements of income historically showed Gas Utility operating revenues and expense line items separately from Gas Marketing and other operations. The current presentation shows operating revenues and expense line items on a consolidated basis. Disaggregated data is presented in Note 14, Information by Operating Segment. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.\n2. REVENUE\nThe following tables show revenue disaggregated by source and customer type.\nThe Utilities sell natural gas to residential and other customers. The sale of natural gas is governed by the various state utility commissions, which set rates, charges, and terms and conditions of service, collectively included in a \u201ctariff.\u201d The performance obligation, which relates to the promise to provide natural gas, is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the natural gas, and revenue is recognized accordingly.\nThe Utilities\u2019 transportation revenue relates to the promise to transport the specified quantities of natural gas at tariff rates. This performance obligation is satisfied over time as the gas is transported, and revenue is recognized as invoiced monthly.\nThe Utilities have alternative revenue programs (ARPs), which represent an agreement between the utility and its regulator, currently consisting of decoupling mechanisms (also known as weather normalization adjustments) and incentive programs (primarily Alabama\u2019s Cost Control Measure). When the criteria to recognize additional (or reduced) revenue from ARPs have been met, the Utilities establish a regulatory asset (or liability). When amounts previously recognized for ARPs are billed, the Utilities reduce the regulatory asset (or liability) and increase (or decrease) accounts receivable. Billed amounts, which are part of the overall tariff paid by customers, are included in revenue from contracts with customers, while the change in the related regulatory asset or liability is presented as revenue from ARPs. Depending on whether the beginning accrued ARP balance was a regulatory asset or liability and depending on the size and direction of the current period accrual, the amount presented as revenue from ARPs could be negative.\nThe Utilities read meters and bill customers on monthly cycles. Spire Missouri, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi record their gas utility revenues from gas sales and transportation services on an accrual basis that includes estimated amounts for gas delivered but not yet billed. The accruals for unbilled revenues are reversed in the subsequent accounting period when meters are actually read and customers are billed. Spire Alabama records natural gas distribution revenues in accordance with the tariff established by the APSC. Unbilled revenue is accrued in an amount equal to the related gas cost, as profit margin is not considered earned until billed. Spire\u2019s other subsidiaries, including Spire Marketing, record revenues when earned, as the product is delivered or as services are performed.\nGas Marketing\u2019s contracts are derivatives. The wholesale contracts (with producers, municipalities, and utility companies) are subject to derivative accounting. The retail contracts (with large commercial and industrial customers) are designated as \u201cnormal purchase, normal sale\u201d arrangements and are therefore accounted for as revenue from contracts with customers. The performance obligation is satisfied over time by the transfer of control of natural gas to the customer, and revenue is recognized as invoiced monthly.\nPayments are generally required within 30 days of billing, and contracts generally do not have a significant financing component. Spire\u2019s revenues are not subject to significant returns, refunds, or warranty obligations.\nSpire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama have elected to apply a \u201cright to invoice\u201d practical expedient, recognizing revenue for volumes delivered for which they have a right to invoice, as long as that amount corresponds with the value to the customer. Disclosures about remaining performance obligations are not required because either contracts have an original expected duration of one year or less, or revenue is recognized under the right to invoice practical expedient, or both.\nSales taxes imposed on applicable Spire Alabama and Spire Missouri sales are billed to customers. These amounts are not recorded in the statements of income but are recorded as tax collections payable and included in the \u201cOther\u201d line of the Current Liabilities section of the balance sheets.\nGross receipts taxes associated with the Company\u2019s natural gas utility services are imposed on the Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama and billed to its customers. The expense amounts (shown in the table below) are reported gross in the \u201cTaxes, other than income taxes\u201d line in the statements of income, and corresponding revenues are reported in \u201cOperating Revenues.\u201d\n3. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Spire 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (EIP) was approved by shareholders of Spire on January 29, 2015 and amended on November 9, 2018. The purpose of the EIP is to encourage directors, officers, and key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to contribute to the Company\u2019s success and align their interests with that of shareholders. To accomplish this purpose, the Compensation Committee (\u201cCommittee\u201d) of Spire\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) may grant awards under the EIP that may be earned by achieving performance objectives and/or other criteria as determined by the Committee. Under the terms of the EIP, officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, as determined by the Committee, are eligible to be selected for awards. The EIP provides for restricted stock, restricted stock units, qualified and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, and performance shares payable in stock, cash, or a combination of both. The EIP generally provides a minimum vesting period of at least three years for each type of award, with pro rata vesting permitted during the minimum three-year vesting period. The maximum number of shares reserved for issuance under the EIP is 1,000,000.\nThe Company issues new shares to satisfy employee restricted stock awards.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nDuring fiscal 2020, the Company granted 91,662 performance-contingent restricted share units to executive officers and key employees at a weighted average grant date fair value of $76.19 per share. This number represents the target shares that can be earned pursuant to the terms of the awards. The share units have a performance period ending September 30, 2023. While the participants have no interim voting rights on these share units, dividends accrue during the performance period and are paid to the participants upon vesting but are subject to forfeiture if the underlying share units do not vest.\nThe number of share units that will ultimately vest is dependent upon the attainment of certain levels of earnings and other strategic goals, as well as the Company\u2019s level of total shareholder return (TSR) during the performance period relative to a comparator group of peer companies. This TSR provision is considered a market condition under GAAP and is discussed further below. The maximum amount of shares that can be earned pursuant to the terms of the awards is 200% of the target units granted.\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of performance-contingent restricted share units granted during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was $80.72 and $79.88 per share, respectively.\nFiscal 2020 activity of restricted stock units subject to performance and/or market conditions is presented below:\nFor the year ended September 30, 2020, the total number of shares that could be issued if all outstanding award grants attain maximum performance payout is 519,888.\nDuring fiscal 2020, the Company granted 33,350 shares of time-vested restricted stock to executive officers and key employees at a weighted average grant date fair value of $76.13 per share. Unless forfeited based on terms of the agreements, these shares will vest in fiscal 2021. In the interim, participants receive full voting rights and dividends, which are not subject to forfeiture. The weighted average grant date fair value of time-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded to employees during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was $76.66 and $76.60 per share, respectively.\nDuring fiscal 2020, the Company granted 10,560 shares of time-vested restricted stock to non-employee directors at a weighted average grant date fair value of $84.58 per share. These shares vested in fiscal 2020, six months after the grant date. The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock awarded to non-employee directors during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was $78.69 and $63.20 per share, respectively.\nTime-vested restricted stock and stock unit activity for fiscal 2020 is presented below:\nFor restricted stock and stock units (performance-contingent and time-vested) that vested during fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company withheld 41,353 shares, 28,731 shares and 34,922 shares, respectively, at weighted average prices of $77.07, $79.23 and $81.65 per share, respectively, pursuant to elections by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations. The total fair value of restricted stock (performance-contingent and time-vested) that vested during fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $9.8, $7.6, and $10.5, respectively, and the related tax benefit was $3.7, $2.9, and $4.0, respectively. None of the tax benefits have been realized.\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company gave participants in the EIP the ability to defer a portion or all of their award. Participants have elected to defer 59,408 shares and 80,760 shares (at target payout) in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Based on actual performance, these awards will be issued in cash, not shares, once the performance requirements have been achieved, so related amounts are reflected as temporary equity on the consolidated balance sheet.\nEquity Compensation Costs\nCompensation cost for performance-contingent restricted stock and stock unit awards is based upon the probable outcome of the performance conditions. For shares or units that do not vest or that are not expected to vest due to the outcome of the performance conditions (excluding market conditions), no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed.\nThe fair value of awards of performance-contingent and time-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units, not subject to the TSR provision, are estimated using the closing price of the Company\u2019s stock on the grant date. For those awards that do not pay dividends during the vesting period, the estimate of fair value is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the Company\u2019s common stock during the performance period, discounted using an appropriate U.S. Treasury yield. For shares subject to the TSR provision, the estimated impact of this market condition is reflected in the grant date fair value per share of the awards. Accordingly, compensation cost is not reversed to reflect any actual reductions in the awards that may result from the TSR provision. However, if the Company\u2019s TSR during the performance period ranks below the level specified in the award agreements, relative to a comparator group of companies, and the Committee elects not to reduce the award (or reduce by a lesser amount), this election would be accounted for as a modification of the original award and additional compensation cost would be recognized at that time. The grant date fair value of the awards subject to the TSR provision awarded during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was valued by a Monte Carlo simulation model that assessed the probabilities of various TSR outcomes. The significant assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulations are as follows:\nThe risk-free interest rate was based on the yield on U.S. Treasury securities matching the vesting period. A zero percent dividend yield was used, which is mathematically equivalent to the assumption that dividends are reinvested as they are paid. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company\u2019s stock. Volatility assumptions were also made for each of the companies included in the comparator group. The vesting period is equal to the performance period set forth in the terms of the award.\nThe amounts of compensation cost recognized for share-based compensation arrangements are presented below:\nAs of September 30, 2020, there was $10.8 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.75 years.\n4. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE\n5. SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nSpire\nPreferred Stock\nAt September 30, 2020 and 2019, Spire had authorized 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock.\nOn May 21, 2019, Spire completed the public offering of 10,000,000 depositary shares (the \u201cDepositary Shares\u201d), each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of the Company\u2019s 5.90% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $25.00 per share, with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d). The transaction resulted in $242.0 of net proceeds, after deducting commissions and sale expenses, which proceeds were used to (i) refinance long-term and short-term Spire debt and (ii) fund capital expenditures at both the Utilities and Spire\u2019s gas-related businesses.\nDividends on the Preferred Stock, when declared by the Board, will be payable on the liquidation preference amount, on a cumulative basis, quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of February, May, August and November of each year, beginning on August 15, 2019. Dividends will be payable out of amounts legally available for the payment of dividends at an annual rate equal to 5.90% of the liquidation preference per share of Preferred Stock (equivalent to $25.00 per Depositary Share). Dividends will accumulate daily and be cumulative from May 21, 2019.\nUnder the terms of the Preferred Stock, the Company\u2019s ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase or redeem, shares of its common stock or any class or series of capital stock of the Company that rank junior to the Preferred Stock will be subject to certain restrictions in the event that the Company does not declare and pay the full cumulative dividends on the Preferred Stock through the most recently completed quarterly dividend period.\nSpire may, at its option, redeem the Preferred Stock (i) in whole, but not in part, at any time prior to August 15, 2024, within 120 days after a ratings event where a rating agency amends, clarifies or changes the criteria it uses to assign equity credit for securities such as the Preferred Stock, at a redemption price in cash equal to $25,500 per share, or (ii) in whole or in part, from time to time, on or after August 15, 2024, at a redemption price in cash equal to $25,000 per share, plus, in each case, all accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether declared or not) up to such redemption date.\nShareholders of the Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights with respect to matters that generally require the approval of voting stockholders. The limited voting rights of holders of the Preferred Stock include the right to vote on certain matters that may affect the preference or special rights of the Preferred Stock. In addition, if and whenever dividends on any shares of Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for at least six dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors then constituting the Board shall automatically be increased by two (to be elected by the holders of the Preferred Stock) until all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock have been paid in full.\nATM Program\nOn February 6, 2019, Spire entered into an at-the-market (ATM) equity distribution agreement, supplemented as of May 14, 2019, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $150.0. Proceeds from this program are intended to be used (i) to fund, in part, investments related to the construction of infrastructure and infrastructure improvements in the Utilities, as well as pipelines and storage, and (ii) for general corporate purposes, including repayment of short-term debt and the adjustment from time to time of the Company\u2019s capital structure. Under this program, for the year ended September 30, 2020, Spire issued 446,619 shares, generating $32.0 of proceeds net of issuance costs, and for the year ended September 30, 2019, Spire issued 179,630 shares, generating $14.4 of proceeds net of issuance costs.\nOther Equity Information\nSpire has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the issuance and sale of up to 250,000 shares of common stock under its Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan. There were 207,254 and 201,148 shares at September 30, 2020 and November 13, 2020, respectively, remaining available for issuance under this Form S-3. Spire also has a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC for the issuance of various equity and debt securities, which expires on May 14, 2022.\nSpire Missouri\nSubstantially all of Spire Missouri\u2019s plant is subject to the liens of its first mortgage bonds. The mortgage contains several restrictions on Spire Missouri\u2019s ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock or to make loans to its parent company. These mortgage restrictions are applicable regardless of whether the stock is publicly held or held solely by Spire Missouri\u2019s parent company. Under the most restrictive of these provisions, no cash dividend may be declared or paid if, after the dividend, the aggregate net amount spent for all dividends after September 30, 1953 would exceed a maximum amount determined by a formula set out in the mortgage. Under that formula, the maximum amount is the sum of $8.0 plus earnings applicable to common stock (adjusted for stock repurchases and issuances) for the period from September 30, 1953 to the last day of the quarter before the declaration or payment date for the dividends. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the amount under the mortgage\u2019s formula that was available to pay dividends was $1,269.4 and $1,182.4, respectively. Thus, all of Spire Missouri\u2019s retained earnings were free from such dividend restrictions as of those dates.\nSpire Missouri has a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC for the issuance of various equity and debt securities, which expires on May 14, 2022. Spire Missouri was authorized by the MoPSC to issue registered securities (first mortgage bonds, unsecured debt and preferred stock), common stock, and private placement debt in an aggregate amount of up to $500.0 for financings placed any time before September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2020, $125.0 remained available under this authorization.\nAt September 30, 2020 and 2019, Spire Missouri had authorized 1,480,000 shares of preferred stock, but none were issued and outstanding.\nSpire Alabama\nAt September 30, 2020 and 2019, Spire Alabama had authorized 120,000 shares of preferred stock, but none were issued and outstanding.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of income taxes, recognized in the balance sheets at September 30 were as follows:\nIncome tax expense (benefit) recorded for items of other comprehensive income (loss) reported in the statements of comprehensive income is calculated by applying statutory federal, state, and local income tax rates applicable to ordinary income. The tax rates applied to individual items of other comprehensive income (loss) are similar within each reporting period. For the periods presented, Spire Alabama had no AOCI balances.\n6. LONG-TERM DEBT\nThe composition of long-term debt as of September 30 is shown in the following tables.\nMaturities of long-term debt for Spire on a consolidated basis, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama for the five fiscal years after September 30, 2020 are as follows:\nThe long-term debt agreements of Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama contain customary financial covenants and default provisions. As of September 30, 2020, there were no events of default under these financial covenants.\nSpire\nAt September 30, 2020, including the current portion but excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, Spire had long-term debt totaling $2,500.0, of which $1,098.0 was issued by Spire Missouri, $475.0 was issued by Spire Alabama and $237.0 was issued by other subsidiaries. All long-term debt bears fixed rates and is subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change. However, increases and decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Company were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity. Under GAAP applicable to the Utilities\u2019 regulated operations, losses or gains on early redemption of long-term debt would typically be deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and amortized over a future period. Interest expense shown on Spire\u2019s consolidated statement of income is net of capitalized interest totaling $5.8, $6.8 and $2.6 for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs indicated in Note 5, Shareholders\u2019 Equity, Spire has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC for the issuance of equity and debt securities.\nSpire Missouri\nAt September 30, 2020, including the current portion (none) but excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, Spire Missouri had long-term debt totaling $1,098.0. All long-term debt bears fixed rates and is subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change. Interest expense shown on Spire Missouri\u2019s statement of comprehensive income is net of capitalized interest totaling $0.8, $1.9 and $0.9 for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs indicated in Note 5, Shareholders\u2019 Equity, Spire Missouri has a shelf registration on Form S-3 on file with the SEC for issuance of first mortgage bonds, unsecured debt and preferred stock, which expires on May 14, 2022. Spire Missouri was authorized by the MoPSC to issue registered securities (first mortgage bonds, unsecured debt and preferred stock), common stock, and private placement debt in an aggregate amount of up to $500.0 for financings placed any time before September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2020, $125.0 remained available under this authorization.\nSubstantially all of Spire Missouri\u2019s plant is subject to the liens of its first mortgage bonds. The mortgage contains several restrictions on Spire Missouri\u2019s ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock, which are described in Note 5, Shareholders\u2019 Equity.\nSpire Alabama\nAt September 30, 2020, including the current portion but excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, Spire Alabama had fixed-rate long-term debt totaling $475.0. While these long-term debt issues are fixed-rate, they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change. Interest expense shown on Spire Alabama\u2019s statement of income is net of capitalized interest totaling $1.9 for the year ended September 30, 2020.\nBecause Spire Alabama has no standing authority to issue long-term debt, it must petition the APSC for each planned issuance. On March 24, 2020, the APSC approved an application for up to $150.0 of additional long-term debt financing.\n7. NOTES PAYABLE AND CREDIT AGREEMENTS\nSpire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have a syndicated revolving credit facility pursuant to a loan agreement with 11 banks, expiring October 31, 2023. The loan agreement has an aggregate credit commitment of $975.0, including sublimits of $300.0 for Spire, $475.0 for Spire Missouri and $200.0 for Spire Alabama. These sublimits may be reallocated from time to time among the three borrowers within the $975.0 aggregate commitment, with commitment fees applied for each borrower relative to its credit rating. Spire may use its line to provide for the funding needs of various subsidiaries. The agreement also contains financial covenants limiting each borrower\u2019s consolidated total debt, including short-term debt, to no more than 70% of its total capitalization. As defined in the line of credit, on September 30, 2020, total debt was less than 60% of total capitalization for each borrower.\nSpire has a commercial paper program (\u201cCP Program\u201d) pursuant to which it may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes. Amounts available under the CP Program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time, with the aggregate face or principal amount of the notes outstanding under the CP Program at any time not to exceed $975.0. The notes may have maturities of up to 365 days from date of issue.\nOn March 26, 2020, Spire entered into a new loan agreement with two banks providing for a term loan of $150.0, which was immediately fully funded and matures on March 25, 2021, subject to optional prepayment by Spire. The term loan bears interest at the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the loan agreement) plus 0.85% per annum. Proceeds were used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nInformation about Spire\u2019s consolidated short-term borrowings and about Spire Missouri\u2019s and Spire Alabama\u2019s borrowings from Spire is presented in the following table. As of September 30, 2020, $449.8 of Spire\u2019s short-term borrowings were used to support lending to the Utilities.\n8. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:\n9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe information presented below categorizes the assets and liabilities in the balance sheets that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition.\nThe mutual funds included in Level 1 are valued based on exchange-quoted market prices of individual securities. The mutual funds included in Level 2 are valued based on the closing net asset value per unit.\nDerivative instruments included in Level 1 are valued using quoted market prices on the NYMEX or the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Derivative instruments classified in Level 2 include physical commodity derivatives that are valued using broker or dealer quotation services whose prices are derived principally from, or are corroborated by, observable market inputs. Also included in Level 2 are certain derivative instruments that have values that are similar to, and correlate with, quoted prices for exchange-traded instruments in active markets. Derivative instruments included in Level 3 are valued using generally unobservable inputs that are based upon the best information available and reflect management\u2019s assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability. There were no material Level 3 balances as of September 30, 2020 or 2019. The Company\u2019s and the Utilities\u2019 policy is to recognize transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy, if any, as of the beginning of the interim reporting period in which circumstances change or events occur to cause the transfer.\nThe mutual funds are included in \u201cOther investments\u201d on the Company\u2019s balance sheets and in \u201cOther Property and Investments\u201d on Spire Missouri\u2019s balance sheets. Derivative assets and liabilities, including receivables and payables associated with cash margin requirements, are presented net on the balance sheets when a legally enforceable netting agreement exist between the Company, Spire Missouri or Spire Alabama and the counterparty to the derivative contract. For additional information on derivative instruments, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.\nSpire\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Alabama\nSpire Alabama occasionally utilizes a gasoline derivative program to stabilize the cost of fuel used in operations. As of September 30, 2020, and September 30, 2019, there were no gasoline derivatives outstanding.\n10. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nSpire\nSpire Missouri has a risk management policy to utilize various derivatives, including futures contracts, exchange-traded options and swaps for the explicit purpose of managing price risk associated with purchasing and delivering natural gas on a regular basis to customers in accordance with its tariffs. The objective of this policy is to limit Spire Missouri\u2019s exposure to natural gas price volatility and to manage, hedge and mitigate substantial price risk. Further discussion of this policy can be found in the Spire Missouri section.\nFrom time to time Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama purchase NYMEX futures and options contracts to help stabilize operating costs associated with forecasted purchases of gasoline and diesel fuels used to power vehicles and equipment. Further information on these derivatives can be found in the Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama sections, respectively.\nIn the course of its business, Spire\u2019s gas marketing subsidiary, Spire Marketing (including a wholly owned subsidiary), enters into commitments associated with the purchase or sale of natural gas. Certain of Spire Marketing\u2019s derivative natural gas contracts are designated as normal purchases or normal sales and, as such, are excluded from the scope of ASC Topic 815 and are accounted for as executory contracts on an accrual basis. Any of Spire Marketing\u2019s derivative natural gas contracts that are not designated as normal purchases or normal sales are accounted for at fair value. At September 30, 2020, the fair values of 278.3 million MMBtu of non-exchange-traded natural gas commodity contracts were reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Of these contracts, 233.1 million MMBtu will settle during fiscal 2021, and 35.7 million MMBtu, 5.8 million MMBtu, 1.3 million MMBtu, 1.6 million MMBtu, and 0.8 million MMBtu will settle during fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026, respectively. These contracts have not been designated as hedges; therefore, changes in the fair value of these contracts are reported in earnings each period.\nFurthermore, Spire Marketing manages the price risk associated with its fixed-priced commitments by either closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed prices or through the use of NYMEX or ICE futures, swap, and option contracts to lock in margins.\nAt September 30, 2020, Spire Marketing\u2019s unmatched fixed-price positions were not material to Spire\u2019s financial position or results of operations. Spire Marketing\u2019s NYMEX and ICE natural gas futures, swap and option contracts used to lock in margins may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions for financial reporting purposes.\nIn August 2018, Spire entered into a three- year interest rate swap with a fixed interest rate of 2.7675% and a notional amount of $100.0 to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company settled this position, resulting in a loss of $2.5 which will be amortized to interest expense over the hedged periods. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company entered into a three-year interest rate swap with a fixed interest rate of 3.250% and a notional amount of $100.0 to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates on future interest rate payments. The Company recorded a cumulative $53.7 mark-to-market loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss on this swap at September 30, 2020. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company entered into multiple interest rate swaps with fixed interest rates ranging from 0.921% to 1.3105% for a total notional amount of $150.0 to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates on future interest rate payments. The Company recorded a $0.5 mark-to-market loss to comprehensive income for these swaps for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company entered into a ten-year interest rate swap with a fixed interest rate of 0.761% and a notional amount of $40.0 to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates on future interest rate payments. In the fourth quarter of 2020 the Company settled this hedged position, resulting in a loss of $0.3 which will be amortized to interest expense over the hedged periods.\nThe Company\u2019s and Spire Missouri\u2019s exchange-traded/cleared derivative instruments consist primarily of NYMEX and ICE positions. The NYMEX is the primary national commodities exchange on which natural gas derivatives are traded. Open NYMEX and ICE natural gas futures and swap positions at September 30, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nAt September 30, 2020, neither Spire Missouri nor Spire Marketing had any further price mitigation in place.\nDerivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions are recognized on the balance sheets of the Company at fair value, and the change in fair value of the effective portion of these hedge instruments is recorded, net of income tax, in other comprehensive income or loss (OCI). Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCI) is a component of Total Common Stock Equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI into earnings when the hedged items affect net income, using the same revenue or expense category that the hedged item impacts. Based on market prices at September 30, 2020, it is expected that an immaterial amount of unrealized gains will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Income of the Company during the next twelve months. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the items that are being hedged in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n*\nGains and losses on Spire Missouri\u2019s natural gas derivative instruments, which are not designated as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes, are deferred pursuant to the Missouri Utilities\u2019 PGA clauses and initially recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. These gains and losses are excluded from the table above because they have no direct impact on the statements of income. Such amounts are recognized in the statements of income as a component of Regulated Gas Distribution Natural and Propane Gas operating expenses when they are recovered through the PGA clause and reflected in customer billings.\n*\nThe fair values of Derivative Assets and Derivative Liabilities exclude the fair value of cash margin receivables or payables with counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Fair value amounts of derivative contracts (including the fair value amounts of cash margin receivables and payables) for which there is a legal right to set off are presented net on the balance sheets. As such, the gross balances presented in the table above are not indicative of the Company\u2019s net economic exposure. Refer to Note 9, Fair Value Measurements, for information on the valuation of derivative instruments.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of the amounts in the tables above to the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nAdditionally, at September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $7.6 and $8.1, respectively, in cash margin receivables not offset with derivatives, which are presented in Accounts Receivable - Other.\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Missouri has a risk management policy to utilize various derivatives, including futures contracts, exchange-traded options, swaps and over-the-counter instruments for the explicit purpose of managing price risk associated with purchasing and delivering natural gas on a regular basis to customers in accordance with its tariffs. The objective of this policy is to limit Spire Missouri\u2019s exposure to natural gas price volatility and to manage, hedge and mitigate substantial price risk. This policy strictly prohibits speculation and permits Spire Missouri to hedge current physical natural gas purchase commitments or forecasted or anticipated future peak (maximum) physical need for natural gas delivered. Costs and cost reductions, including carrying costs, associated with Spire Missouri\u2019s use of natural gas derivative instruments are allowed to be passed on to Spire Missouri customers through the operation of its PGA clause, through which the MoPSC allows Spire Missouri to recover gas supply costs, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC. Accordingly, Spire Missouri does not expect any adverse earnings impact as a result of the use of these derivative instruments.\nSpire Missouri does not designate these instruments as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes because gains or losses associated with the use of these derivative instruments are deferred and recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, and, as a result, have no direct impact on the statements of income.\nThe timing of the operation of the PGA clause may cause interim variations in short-term cash flows, because Spire Missouri is subject to cash margin requirements associated with changes in the values of these instruments. Nevertheless, carrying costs associated with such requirements are recovered through the PGA clause.\nFrom time to time, Spire Missouri purchases NYMEX futures and options contracts to help stabilize operating costs associated with forecasted purchases of gasoline and diesel fuels used to power vehicles and equipment used in the course of its business. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions pursuant to ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The gains or losses on these derivative instruments are not subject to Spire Missouri\u2019s PGA clause. At September 30, 2020, Spire Missouri had an immaterial amount of gasoline futures contracts outstanding.\nDerivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions are recognized on the balance sheets at fair value and the change in the fair value of the effective portion of these hedge instruments is recorded, net of income tax, in OCI. AOCI is a component of Total Common Stock Equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI into earnings when the hedged items affect net income, using the same revenue or expense category that the hedged item impacts. Based on market prices at September 30, 2020, it is expected that an immaterial amount of pre-tax gains will be reclassified into the statements of income during fiscal 2021. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the items that are being hedged in the statements of cash flows.\nSpire Missouri\u2019s derivative instruments consist primarily of NYMEX positions. The NYMEX is the primary national commodities exchange on which natural gas derivatives are traded. Open NYMEX natural gas futures positions at September 30, 2020 were as follows:\nAt September 30, 2020, Spire Missouri had no other price mitigation derivatives in place.\n*\nGains and losses on Spire Missouri\u2019s natural gas derivative instruments, which are not designated as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes, are deferred pursuant to the Spire Missouri\u2019s PGA clauses and initially recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. These gains and losses are excluded from the table above because they have no direct impact on the Statements of Income. Such amounts are recognized in the Statements of Income as a component of Regulated Gas Distribution Natural and Propane Gas operating expenses when they are recovered through the PGA clause and reflected in customer billings.\n*\nThe fair values of Derivative Assets and Derivative Liabilities exclude the fair value of cash margin receivables or payables with counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Fair value amounts of derivative contracts (including the fair value amounts of cash margin receivables and payables) for which there is a legal right to set off are presented net on the Balance Sheets. As such, the gross balances presented in the table above are not indicative of Spire Missouri\u2019s net economic exposure. Refer to Note 9, Fair Value Measurements, for information on the valuation of derivative instruments.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of the amounts in the tables above to the amounts presented in Spire Missouri\u2019s Balance Sheets:\nAdditionally, at September 30, 2019 and 2018, Spire Missouri had $7.2 and $7.8, respectively, in cash margin receivables not offset with derivatives, which are presented in Accounts Receivable - Other.\nSpire Alabama\nSpire Alabama periodically employs a gasoline derivative program to help stabilize operating costs associated with forecasted purchases of gasoline and diesel fuels used to power vehicles and equipment used in the course of its business. The gains or losses on these derivative instruments are not subject to Spire Alabama\u2019s GSA rider. The level of contracts outstanding as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 were not material.\n11. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK\nSpire\u2019s Gas Utility segment serves 1.7 million customers in three states across multiple rate classes resulting in a significant amount of revenue diversity. Credit risk is mitigated by the high percentage of residential customers as well as the geographic diversity of the Utilities, though customers for each of the Utilities are concentrated in a single state.\nSpire Marketing\u2019s accounts receivable attributable to utility companies and their marketing affiliates totaled $73.0 at September 30, 2020. The concentration of transactions with these counterparties has the potential to affect the Company\u2019s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that customers in this group may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry, or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk with certain individually significant counterparties. At September 30, 2020, the amounts included in accounts receivable from its five largest counterparties (in terms of net accounts receivable exposure) totaled $35.7. Four of these five counterparties are investment-grade rated integrated utilities, while the fifth is not rated but is a subsidiary of an investment-grade rated company.\nTo manage these risks, Spire Marketing has established procedures to determine the creditworthiness of its counterparties. These procedures include obtaining credit ratings and credit reports, analyzing counterparty financial statements to assess financial condition, and considering the industry environment in which the counterparty operates. This information is monitored on an ongoing basis. In some instances, Spire Marketing may require credit assurances such as prepayments, letters of credit, or parental guaranties. In addition, Spire Marketing may enter into netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties in the energy industry with whom it conducts both sales and purchases of natural gas. Where there is no netting arrangement, Spire Marketing records accounts receivable, accounts payable, and prepayments for physical sales and purchases of natural gas on a gross basis. Sales are typically made on an unsecured credit basis with payment due the month following delivery. Accounts receivable amounts are closely monitored and provisions for uncollectible amounts are accrued when losses are probable.\n12. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama are subject to federal income tax as well as income tax in various state and local jurisdictions. Spire files a consolidated federal income tax return and various state income tax returns and allocates income taxes to Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and its other subsidiaries as if each entity were a separate taxpayer.\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was as follows:\nThe effective income tax rate varied from the federal statutory income tax rate for each year due to the following:\n*\nOther consists primarily of property adjustments.\nThe significant items comprising the net deferred tax liability or asset as of September 30 were as follows:\n**\nFor Spire, Other consists primarily of goodwill-related liabilities.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was signed into law on December 22, 2017, with an effective date of January 1, 2018, for substantially all of the provisions. This comprehensive act includes significant reform of the current income tax code including changes in the calculation for business entities and a reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The specific provisions related to regulated public utilities in the TCJA generally allow for the continued deductibility of interest expense, the elimination of full expensing for tax purposes of certain property acquired after September 27, 2017 and the continuation of certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits.\nASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires that the effects of changes in tax laws be recognized in the period in which the new law is enacted. It also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. For the Company\u2019s regulated entities, the changes in deferred taxes related to the regulated operations are recorded as either an offset to or creation of a regulatory asset or liability and may be subject to refund to customers in future periods. The changes in deferred taxes that are not associated with rate making (including all changes for the Company\u2019s non-regulated operations) are recorded as adjustments to deferred tax expense or benefit.\nAs indicated in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company\u2019s regulated operations accounting for income taxes is impacted by ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. Reductions in deferred income tax balances due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate resulted in amounts previously collected from utility customers for these deferred taxes becoming refundable to such customers, generally through reductions in future rates. The TCJA includes provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes are to be passed back to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits. In fiscal 2018, the MoPSC Amended Report and Order took effect and the estimated excess accumulated deferred income tax began to be returned to Spire Missouri customers in rates. The amount being returned is estimated with a tracker established to defer the difference from the estimated amounts to the actual amounts once the actual amounts have been calculated. Excess accumulated deferred taxes of $8.4 were returned by Spire Missouri during both fiscal 2020 and 2019. The treatment for accumulated deferred income tax balances for Spire Alabama, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi is yet to be determined by state regulators.\nThe Company recorded the TCJA impacts in fiscal 2018, including the impact of the federal income tax rate reduction and the revaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities. The total adjustments recorded, before reduction for amounts returned to customers, for the year ended September 30, 2018, were as follows:\nIn assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considers all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years, the timing of deferred tax liability reversals, projected future taxable income, taxable income in carryback years, and tax planning strategies to assess the need for a valuation allowance. Based upon this evidence, management believes it is more likely than not the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets, except for the contribution carryforward valuation allowances noted below.\nThe Company had federal and state loss carryforwards of approximately $726.8 at September 30, 2020. The loss carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal 2030 for certain state purposes and fiscal 2035 for federal and other states purposes. The Company also had contribution carryforwards of approximately $9.3 at September 30, 2020, which began to expire this year. The Company has a valuation allowance of $3.6, as a portion of the contribution carryforward will not be realized prior to its expiration. The Company also has various tax credit carryforwards of approximately $2.9 along with a valuation allowance of $0.1 as a portion of these tax credits began to expire in 2020.\nSpire Missouri had federal and state loss carryforwards of approximately $207.8 at September 30, 2020 on a separate company basis, which begin to expire in fiscal 2035. For federal tax purposes, these loss carryforwards may be utilized against income from another member of the consolidated group. Spire Missouri also has contribution carryforwards of approximately $5.4 at September 30, 2020 that began to expire this year. Spire Missouri has a valuation allowance of $3.0, as a portion of the contribution carryforward will not be realized prior to its expiration. Spire Missouri also has approximately $2.0 of various tax credit carryforwards, and a valuation allowance of $0.1 as a portion of these tax credits began to expire in 2020.\nOn a separate company basis, Spire Alabama had federal and state loss carryforwards of approximately $443.5 at September 30, 2020. The loss carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal 2030 for state purposes and fiscal 2035 for federal purposes. For federal tax purposes, these loss carryforwards may be utilized against income from another member of the consolidated group.\nThe Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama recognize the tax benefit from a tax position only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Unrecognized tax benefits are reported as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for an operating loss carryforward to the extent the recognition of the benefit would impact the operating loss carryforward, pursuant to ASU 2013-11. In addition, pursuant to the TCJA, the deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward was revalued in fiscal 2018 based on the federal tax law change. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of unrecognized tax benefits:\nAs of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate were $2.9 and $2.5 , respectively, for the Company and $2.7 and $2.2, respectively, for Spire Missouri. It is reasonably possible that events will occur in the next 12 months that could increase or decrease the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits. The Company and Spire Missouri do not expect that any such change will be significant to the balance sheets. Spire Alabama reported no unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nThe Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama record potential interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as interest expense and other income deductions, respectively. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, interest accrued associated with uncertain tax positions was de minimis, and no penalties were accrued.\nThe Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama are no longer subject to examination for fiscal years prior to 2017, except to the extent the net operating losses from prior years are reviewed.\n13. PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nPension Plans\nThe pension plans of Spire consist of plans for employees at Spire Missouri, the employees of Spire Alabama and employees of the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth.\nSpire Missouri has non-contributory, defined benefit, trusteed forms of pension plans covering the majority of their employees. Plan assets consist primarily of corporate and U.S. government obligations and a growth segment consisting of exposure to equity markets, commodities, real estate and inflation-indexed securities, achieved through derivative instruments.\nSpire Alabama has non-contributory, defined benefit, trusteed forms of pension plans covering the majority of its employees. Qualified plan assets are comprised of mutual and commingled funds consisting of U.S. equities with varying strategies, global equities, alternative investments, and fixed income investments.\nThe net periodic pension costs include the following components:\nOther changes in plan assets and pension benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income or loss include the following:\nSpire pension obligations are driven by separate plan and regulatory provisions governing Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and Spire EnergySouth pension plans.\nPursuant to the provisions of Spire Missouri\u2019s and Spire Alabama\u2019s pension plans, pension obligations may be satisfied by monthly annuities, lump-sum cash payments, or special termination benefits. Lump-sum payments are recognized as settlements (which can result in gains or losses) only if the total of such payments exceeds the sum of service and interest costs in a specific year. Special termination benefits, when offered, are also recognized as settlements which can result in gains or losses. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, two Spire Missouri plans and one Spire Alabama plan met the criteria for settlement recognition, requiring re-measurement of the obligation under those plans using updated census data and assumptions for discount rate and mortality. For the remeasurements, the discount rates for the Missouri plans were updated to 2.85% at September 30, 2020 (from 3.2% at September 30, 2019), and the discount rate for the Alabama plan was updated to 2.95% (from 3.20%). Lump-sum payments recognized as settlements during fiscal year 2020 was $89.3 ($74.5 attributable to Spire Missouri and $14.8 to Spire Alabama).\nNo Spire plans met the criteria for settlement recognition for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.\nPursuant to a MoPSC Order, the return on plan assets is based on the market-related value of plan assets implemented prospectively over a four-year period. Gains or losses not yet includible in pension cost are amortized only to the extent that such gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. Such excess is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants.\nEffective April 19, 2018, the pension cost for Spire Missouri\u2019s western territory (Missouri West) included in customer rates was reduced from $9.9 to $5.5 per year, the pension cost included in Spire Missouri\u2019s eastern territory (Missouri East) customer rates was increased from $15.5 to $29.0 per year. Over an amortization period of eight years, Missouri East rates also include the amortization of $173.0 of assets for pension and other postretirement benefits, and Missouri West rates will be reduced by the amortization of a $26.2 net liability for pension and other postretirement benefits.\nThe difference between these amounts and pension expense as calculated pursuant to the above and that otherwise would be included in the statements of income and statements of comprehensive income is deferred as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability.\nThe following table shows the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the pension benefit obligation at September 30:\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the fair value of plan assets at September 30:\nThe following table sets forth the amounts recognized in the balance sheets at September 30:\nPre-tax amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss not yet recognized as components of net periodic pension cost consist of:\nAt September 30, 2020, the following pre-tax amounts are expected to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost during fiscal 2020:\nThe assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension costs for Spire Missouri are as follows:\nThe assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension costs for Spire Alabama are as follows:\nThe discount rate is based on long-term, high quality bond indices at the measurement date. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the investment portfolio. Assumed projected rates of return for each asset class were selected after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns. The overall expected rate of return for the portfolio was developed based on the target allocation for each class.\nThe assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations are as follows:\nFollowing are the year-end projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for plans that have a projected benefit obligation and an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets:\nFollowing are the targeted and actual plan assets by category as of September 30 of each year for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama:\n*\nIncludes cash for 2020. For 2019, includes cash and funds invested in real estate, commodities, natural resources and inflation-protected securities.\nSpire Missouri\u2019s investment policies are designed to maximize, to the extent possible, the funded status of the plans over time, and minimize volatility of funding and costs. The policy seeks to maximize investment returns consistent with these objectives and Spire Missouri\u2019s tolerance for risk. The duration of plan liabilities and the impact of potential changes in asset values on the funded status are fundamental considerations in the selection of plan assets. Outside investment management specialists are utilized in each asset class. Such specialists are provided with guidelines, where appropriate, designed to ensure that the investment portfolio is managed in accordance with the policy. The policy seeks to avoid significant concentrations of risk by investing in a diversified portfolio of assets, currently including a growth (equity) component and a liability-driven (debt) component. Investments in corporate, U.S. government and agencies, and, to a lesser extent, international debt securities seek to provide duration matching with plan liabilities, and typically have investment grade ratings and reflect allocations across various entities and industries. There are also exposures to additional asset types in the target portfolio: commodities, real estate and inflation-indexed securities. For the Missouri East plan, the investment policy permits the use of derivative instruments, which may be used to achieve the desired market exposure of an index, adjust portfolio duration, or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation. The growth strategy utilizes a combination of derivative instruments and debt securities to achieve diversified exposure to equity and other markets while generating returns from the fixed-income investments and providing further duration matching with the liabilities. Performance and compliance with the guidelines are regularly monitored. The policy calls for increased allocations to debt securities as the funded status improves.\nSpire Alabama employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets with a prudent level of risk. Risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, corporate financial condition and market conditions. Spire Alabama has developed an investment strategy that focuses on asset allocation, diversification and quality guidelines. The investment goals are to obtain an adequate level of return to meet future obligations of the plans by providing above average risk-adjusted returns with a risk exposure in the mid-range of comparable funds. Investment managers are retained by Spire Alabama to manage separate pools of assets. Funds are allocated to such managers in order to achieve an appropriate, diversified, and balanced asset mix. Comparative market and peer group benchmarks are utilized to ensure that investment managers are performing satisfactorily. Spire Alabama seeks to maintain an appropriate level of diversification to minimize the risk of large losses in a single asset class. Accordingly, plan assets for the pension plans do not have a concentration of assets in a single entity, industry, country, commodity or class of investment fund.\nFollowing are expected pension benefit payments for the succeeding five fiscal years, and in aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, for Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama:\nThe funding policy of Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama is to contribute an amount not less than the minimum required by government funding standards nor more than the maximum deductible amount for federal income tax purposes. Spire Missouri\u2019s contributions to the pension plans in fiscal 2021 are anticipated to be $36.4 into the qualified trusts, and $0.6 into the non-qualified plans. Spire Alabama\u2019s contributions to the pension plans in fiscal 2021 are anticipated to be $11.3 into the qualified trusts.\nOther Postretirement Benefits\nSpire and the Utilities provide certain life insurance benefits at retirement. Spire Missouri plans provide for medical insurance after early retirement until age 65. For retirements prior to January 1, 2015, the Missouri West plans provided medical insurance after retirement until death. The Spire Alabama plans provide medical insurance upon retirement until death for certain retirees depending on the type of employee and the date the employee was originally hired.\nNet periodic postretirement benefit costs consist of the following components:\nOther changes in plan assets and postretirement benefit obligations recognized in OCI include the following:\nPursuant to a MoPSC Order, the return on plan assets is based on the market-related value of plan assets implemented prospectively over a four-year period. Gains and losses not yet includible in postretirement benefit cost are amortized only to the extent that such gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. Such excess is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. Effective April 18, 2018, the recovery in rates for Spire Missouri\u2019s postretirement benefit plans is based on an annual allowance of $8.6. The difference between these amounts and postretirement benefit cost based on the above and that otherwise would be included in the statements of income and statements of comprehensive income is deferred as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the postretirement benefit obligation at September 30:\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the fair value of plan assets at September 30:\nThe following table sets forth the amounts recognized in the balance sheets at September 30:\nPre-tax amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss not yet recognized as components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost consist of:\nAt September 30, 2020, the following pre-tax amounts are expected to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic postretirement benefit cost during fiscal 2020:\nThe assumptions used to calculate net periodic postretirement benefit costs for Spire Missouri are as follows:\nThe assumptions used to calculate net periodic postretirement benefit costs for Spire Alabama are as follows:\nThe discount rate is based on long-term, high quality bond indices at the measurement date. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the investment portfolio. Assumed projected rates of return for each asset class were selected after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns. The overall expected rate of return for the portfolio was developed based on the target allocation for each class.\nThe assumptions used to calculate the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations are as follows:\nThe assumed medical cost trend rates at September 30 are as follows:\nThe following table presents the effects of an assumed 1% change in the assumed medical cost trend rate:\nFollowing are the targeted and actual plan assets by category as of September 30 of each year for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama:\nMissouri and Alabama state laws provide for the recovery in rates of costs accrued pursuant to GAAP provided that such costs are funded through an independent, external funding mechanism. The Utilities have established Voluntary Employees\u2019 Beneficiary Association and Rabbi Trusts as external funding mechanisms. Their investment policies seek to maximize investment returns consistent with their tolerance for risk. Outside investment management specialists are utilized in each asset class. Such specialists are provided with guidelines, where appropriate, designed to ensure that the investment portfolio is managed in accordance with policy. Performance and compliance with the guidelines is regularly monitored. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama currently invest in mutual funds which are rebalanced periodically to the target allocation. The mutual funds are diversified across U.S. stock and bond markets, and for Spire Alabama, international stock markets.\nFollowing are expected postretirement benefit payments for the succeeding five fiscal years, and in aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter for Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama:\nThe Utilities\u2019 funding policy is to contribute amounts to the trusts equal to the periodic benefit cost calculated pursuant to GAAP as recovered in rates. For Spire Missouri, contributions to the postretirement plans in fiscal 2021 are anticipated to be $4.8 to the qualified trusts and $0.6 paid directly to participants from Spire Missouri funds. It is not anticipated that contributions will be made to the Spire Alabama postretirement plans in fiscal 2021.\nOther Plans\nSpire Services Inc. sponsors a 401(k) plan that cover substantially all employees of Spire Inc. and its subsidiaries. The plan allows employees to contribute a portion of their base pay in accordance with specific guidelines. The cost of the defined contribution plan for Spire Inc. totaled $13.6, $13.8, and $12.5 for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Spire Missouri provides a match of such contributions within specific limits. The cost of the defined contribution plan for Spire Missouri amounted to $9.5, $10.0, and $9.0 for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Spire Alabama also provides a match of employee contributions within specific limits. The cost of the defined contribution plan for Spire Alabama amounted to $3.4 , $3.1, and $3.0 for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nFair Value Measurements of Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Assets\nSpire\nThe table below categorizes the fair value measurements of the Spire pension plan assets:\nThe table below categorizes the fair value measurements of Spire\u2019s postretirement plan assets:\nCash and cash equivalents include money market mutual funds valued based on quoted market prices.

INFORMATION BY OPERATING SEGMENT\nThe Company has two reportable segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing. The Gas Utility segment is the aggregation of the operations of the Utilities. The Gas Marketing segment includes the results of Spire Marketing, a subsidiary engaged in the non-regulated marketing of natural gas and related activities, including utilizing natural gas storage contracts for providing natural gas sales. Other components of the Company\u2019s consolidated information include:\n\u2022\nunallocated corporate items, including certain debt and associated interest costs;\n\u2022\nSpire STL Pipeline, a subsidiary of Spire which has constructed and, as of November 2019, operates a 65-mile FERC-regulated pipeline to deliver natural gas into eastern Missouri;\n\u2022\nSpire Storage, a subsidiary of Spire providing physical natural gas storage services; and\n\u2022\nSpire\u2019s subsidiaries engaged in the operation of a propane pipeline, the compression of natural gas, and risk management, among other activities.\nAccounting policies are described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intersegment transactions include sales of natural gas from Spire Marketing to Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, sales of natural gas from Spire Missouri to Spire Marketing, sales of natural gas from Spire Alabama to Spire Marketing, propane transportation services provided by Spire NGL Inc. to Spire Missouri, and propane storage services provided by Spire Missouri to Spire NGL Inc.\nManagement evaluates the performance of the operating segments based on the computation of net economic earnings. Net economic earnings exclude from reported net income the after-tax impacts of fair value accounting and timing adjustments associated with energy-related transactions, the impacts of acquisition, divestiture and restructuring activities, and the largely non-cash impacts of other non-recurring or unusual items such as certain regulatory, legislative or GAAP standard-setting actions. In fiscal 2019, this included impacts from ISRS rulings against Spire Missouri. In fiscal 2018, these items included the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the write-off of certain long-standing assets as a result of disallowances in Spire Missouri\u2019s rate proceedings.\n15. REGULATORY MATTERS\nAs discussed below for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, the Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clauses and Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) riders allow the Utilities to pass through to customers the cost of purchased gas supplies. Regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities related to the PGA clauses and the GSA rider are both labeled Unamortized Purchased Gas Adjustments herein.\nThe following regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities were reflected in the Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2020 and 2019.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s regulatory assets are not earning a return and are shown in the schedule below:\nLike all the Company\u2019s regulatory assets, these regulatory assets are expected to be recovered from customers in future rates. The recovery period for the future income taxes due from customers and pension and other postretirement benefit costs could be 20 years or longer, based on current Internal Revenue Service guidelines and average remaining service life of active participants, respectively. The other items not earning a return are expected to be recovered over a period not to exceed 15 years, consistent with precedent set by the MoPSC. Spire Alabama does not have any regulatory assets that are not earning a return.\nSpire Missouri\nAs authorized by the MoPSC, the PGA clause allows Spire Missouri to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies. To better match customer billings with market natural gas prices, Spire Missouri is allowed to file to modify, on a periodic basis, the level of gas costs in its PGA. Certain provisions of the PGA clause are included below:\n\u2022\nSpire Missouri has a risk management policy that allows for the purchase of natural gas derivative instruments with the goal of managing price risk associated with purchasing natural gas on behalf of its customers. The MoPSC clarified that costs, cost reductions, and carrying costs associated with the Utility\u2019s use of natural gas derivative instruments are gas costs recoverable through the PGA mechanism.\n\u2022\nThe tariffs allow Spire Missouri flexibility to make up to three discretionary PGA changes during each year, in addition to its mandatory November PGA change, so long as such changes are separated by at least two months.\n\u2022\nSpire Missouri is authorized to apply carrying costs to all over- or under-recoveries of gas costs, including costs and cost reductions associated with the use of derivative instruments, including cash payments for margin deposits.\n\u2022\nThe MoPSC approved a plan applicable to Spire Missouri\u2019s gas supply commodity costs under which it retains a portion of cost savings associated with the acquisition of natural gas below an established benchmark level. This gas supply cost management program allows Spire Missouri to retain 10% of cost savings, up to a maximum of $3.0 annually. Spire Missouri did not record any such incentive compensation under the plan during the three fiscal years reported. Incentives recorded under the plan, if any, are included in Gas Utility Operating Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income and under Operating Revenues on Spire Missouri\u2019s Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nPursuant to the provisions of the PGA clause, the difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the PGA clause are reflected as a deferred charge or credit at the end of the fiscal year. At that time, the balance is classified as a current asset or current liability and recovered from, or credited to, customers over an annual period commencing in November. The balance in the current account is amortized as amounts are reflected in customer billings.\nThe PGA clause also provides for the treatment of income from off-system sales and capacity release revenues. Pre-tax income from off-system sales and capacity release revenues is shared with customers, with an estimated amount assumed in PGA rates. The difference between the actual amount allocated to customers for each fiscal year and the estimated amount assumed in PGA rates is recovered from, or credited to, customers over an annual period commencing in the subsequent November. Before April 19, 2018, the customer share of such income ranged from 70% to 85%. In the latest rate cases (discussed in the following paragraphs), the multiple sharing tiers and percentages were eliminated in favor of a single sharing percentage under which customers receive 75% (and Spire Missouri receives 25%) of the net margins achieved as a result of such off-system sales and capacity releases.\nOn March 7, 2018, the MoPSC issued its order in two general rate cases (docketed as GR-2017-0215 and GR-2017-0216), approving new tariffs that became effective on April 19, 2018. Certain provisions of the order allow less future recovery of certain deferred or capitalized costs than estimated based upon previous rate proceedings, and management determined that the related regulatory assets should be written down or off in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the second quarter of 2018. The charges totaled $38.4 for the year ended September 30, 2018, and are included primarily in operation and maintenance expense on the statements of income and in other cash flows from operating activities on the statements of cash flows. The after-tax reduction to net income and earnings per share was $23.6 and $0.49, respectively. The charges related to the long-standing pension and real estate assets, totaling $30.6, were excluded in the determination of 2018 net economic earnings, as shown in Note 14, Information by Operating Segment. On April 25, 2018, Spire Missouri filed an appeal of the MoPSC\u2019s order related to the disallowance of certain pension costs incurred prior to 1997 ($28.8), real estate sold in 2014 ($1.8), and rate case expenses ($0.9) to Missouri\u2019s Southern District Court of Appeals. On March 15, 2019, the appeal was denied by the Southern District Court of Appeals, and Spire Missouri requested review by the Missouri Supreme Court, which agreed to take the case. Oral arguments were made before the Missouri Supreme Court on January 29, 2020. The case is awaiting a decision.\nSpire Missouri filed Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge (ISRS) applications which were approved by the MoPSC and the costs associated therewith were included in new tariffs that went into effect from its last general rate cases on April 19, 2018. Since then, ISRS filings became effective on October 8, 2018, May 25, 2019, November 16, 2019, and May 25, 2020, bringing total authorized future annualized ISRS revenues for Spire Missouri to $40.3 as of September 30, 2020. An incremental $7.0 annualized ISRS rate increase was approved by the MoPSC on November 12, 2020, this increase is expected to be effective in late November or early December 2020.\nOn November 19, 2019, the Missouri Western District Court of Appeals issued rulings (\u201cISRS rulings\u201d) that determined certain capital investments in 2016 through 2018 were not eligible for recovery under the ISRS. The ISRS rulings upheld appeals by the OPC that contested recovery of portions of Spire Missouri\u2019s ISRS and overturned the three prior MoPSC decisions. As a result of the rulings, Spire Missouri recorded a $12.2 provision for fiscal year 2019 and an additional $4.8 in the first half of fiscal year 2020. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, Spire Missouri reached a settlement with the MoPSC staff and the OPC to resolve these cases, which was subsequently approved by the MoPSC. Pursuant to the settlement, Spire Missouri has made a customer refund in the total amount of $15.0 as a one-time bill credit issued in August 2020. The favorable difference between the total provision and the actual settlement was recorded to earnings in the third quarter.\nAdditional ISRS appeals were taken by Spire Missouri and the OPC relating to the January 2019 ISRS filings with annual authorized revenue of $12.4, as approved by the MoPSC effective May 25, 2019, and the July 2019 ISRS filings with annual authorized revenue totaling $8.8, which was approved by the MoPSC effective November 16, 2019. The January 2019 ISRS decision has been upheld by the Western District, resulting in no revenue change or customer refund. On October 20, 2020, the Western District issued its opinion in the July 2019 case upholding the MoPSC\u2019s decision, resulting in no revenue change or customer refund.\nHouse Bill 2120 was passed by the General Assembly on May 15, 2020, and signed into law by Missouri Governor Parson on July 2, 2020, clarifying which infrastructure investments qualify for ISRS recovery under the statute governing the ISRS mechanism. The provisions of the bill became effective August 28, 2020, and apply to new ISRS applications made on or after that date.\nIn September 2020, Spire Missouri, the MoPSC staff and the OPC reached a Unanimous Stipulation and Agreement regarding Spire Missouri\u2019s request for an Accounting Authority Order (AAO) pertaining to certain costs and lost customer fee revenue related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2020, the MoPSC issued an order approving that agreement and granting an AAO. Accordingly, Spire Missouri recorded a regulatory asset of $3.8 as of September 30, 2020, related to the deferral of applicable costs and is tracking lost customer fee revenue. All ratemaking treatment of the deferrals and any revenue recoveries is reserved for consideration in Spire Missouri\u2019s next general rate case.\nOn October 8, 2020, Spire Missouri filed a Notice of Intended Rate Case Filing with the MoPSC, indicating its intention to initiate a general base rate case more than 60 days following the filing of the notice. The notice indicates Spire Missouri\u2019s intention to seek rate recovery for investments made since its last general rate case, as well as a need to reset the ISRS cap which has been reached for its western operating unit. The notice further indicates Spire Missouri\u2019s intention to further unify its operating units through the anticipated tariff filings.\nSpire Alabama\nEffective January 1, 2014, Spire Alabama\u2019s allowed range of return on average common equity (ROE) was 10.5% to 10.95% with an adjusting point of 10.8%. Spire Alabama was eligible to receive a performance-based adjustment of 5 basis points to the ROE adjusting point, based on meeting certain customer satisfaction criteria. Under its Rate Stabilization and Equalization (RSE) rate-setting process, the APSC conducts quarterly reviews to determine whether Spire Alabama\u2019s ROE at the end of the rate year will be within the allowed range of return. Reductions in rates can be made quarterly to bring the projected ROE within the allowed range; increases, however, are allowed only once each rate year, effective December 1, and cannot exceed 4% of prior-year revenues. In October 2018, the APSC approved the renewal of RSE through September 30, 2022, with several modifications. Effective October 1, 2018, Spire Alabama\u2019s allowed range of ROE is 10.15% to 10.65% with an adjusting point of 10.4%. Spire Alabama is eligible to receive a performance-based adjustment of +/- 10 basis point to the ROE adjusting point, based upon the terms of the newly approved Accelerated Infrastructure Modernization (AIM) Program tariff. The 5-basis point adjustment for certain customer satisfaction criteria has been removed. Other modifications include an equity limitation as a percent of total capitalization from 56.5% to 55.5% and adjustments to the Cost Control Measure (CCM) as noted below.\nOn November 25, 2019, Spire Alabama filed an increase for rate year 2020 of $5.9, which became effective December 1, 2019. On October 26, 2020, Spire Alabama made its annual RSE rate filing with the APSC, presenting the utility\u2019s budget for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2021, including net income and a calculation of allowed ROE. The AIM mechanism provides for a 10 basis-point increase in the allowed ROE each year if a prescribed number of pipeline miles are replaced. Spire Alabama exceeded the threshold for 2020 and accordingly filed for a 10.5% ROE for fiscal 2021.\nSpire Alabama\u2019s rate schedules for natural gas distribution charges contain a GSA rider which permits the pass-through to customers of changes in the cost of gas supply. Spire Alabama\u2019s tariff provides a temperature adjustment mechanism, also included in the GSA rider, which is designed to moderate the impact of departures from normal temperatures on Spire Alabama\u2019s earnings. The temperature adjustment applies primarily to residential, small commercial and small industrial customers. Other non-temperature weather-related conditions that may affect customer usage are not included in the temperature adjustment. In November 2019, the APSC approved Spire Alabama\u2019s proposal to establish a mechanism under its GSA rider allowing the utility to create value through off-system sales of excess natural gas supply and capacity and to retain 25% of the value created while giving 75% of the value to customers. The mechanism was effective with the establishment of new rates on December 1, 2019. Spire Alabama filed a GSA rate decrease effective February 1, 2020, of approximately $13.9 (on an annual basis) primarily attributable to lower natural gas prices and results of the off-system sale and capacity release share program.\nThe inflation-based CCM, established by the APSC, allows for annual increases to operation and maintenance (\u201cO&M\u201d) expense. If rate year O&M expense falls within the index range, no adjustment is required. If rate year O&M expense exceeds the index range, three-quarters of the difference is returned to customers through future rate adjustments. To the extent rate year O&M is less than the index range, Spire Alabama benefits by one-half of the difference through future rate adjustments. Certain items that fluctuate based on situations demonstrated to be beyond Spire Alabama\u2019s control may be excluded from the CCM calculation. Before fiscal 2019, the CCM index range was Spire Alabama\u2019s 2007 actual rate year O&M expense inflation-adjusted based on the June Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) each rate year, plus or minus 1.75%. Effective October 1, 2018, the CCM is calculated based upon O&M expense per customer and the index range is Spire Alabama\u2019s actual 2018 O&M expense adjusted for inflation and adjusted by 2/3 and 1/3 of the 2018 CCM differential (amount below the CCM range in 2018) in 2019 and 2020, respectively, plus or minus 1.50%. As of September 30, 2020, Spire Alabama recorded an RSE point of test giveback of $3.0 and a CCM benefit of $5.2 for rate year 2020, which will both be reflected in rates effective December 1, 2020. The CCM benefit was $5.9 for rate year 2019 and $9.7 for rate year 2018.\nOn June 28, 2010, the APSC approved a reduction in depreciation rates, effective June 1, 2010, and a regulatory liability to be recorded for Spire Alabama. Refunds from such negative salvage liability were passed back to eligible customers on a declining basis through lower tariff rates through rate year 2019 pursuant to the terms of the Negative Salvage Rebalancing (NSR) rider. The total amount refundable to customers was subject to adjustments for charges made to the Enhanced Stability Reserve (ESR) and other APSC-approved charges. The refunds were due to a re-estimation of future removal costs provided for through the prior depreciation rates. For fiscal 2019 and 2018, NSR amounts returned to customers were approximately $4.2 and $7.2, respectively.\nThe APSC approved an ESR in 1998, which was subsequently modified and expanded in 2010. As currently approved, the ESR provides deferred treatment and recovery for the following: (1) extraordinary O&M expenses related to environmental response costs; (2) extraordinary O&M expenses related to self-insurance costs that exceed $1.0 per occurrence; (3) extraordinary O&M expenses, other than environmental response costs and self-insurance costs, resulting from a single force majeure event or multiple force majeure events greater than $0.3 and $0.4, respectively, during a rate year; and (4) negative individual large commercial and industrial customer budget revenue variances that exceed $0.4 during a rate year. Spire Alabama is tracking costs and other impacts of COVID-19 in anticipation that some of these items could be recoverable under its ESR, but no related changes to regulatory assets or liabilities have been recorded to date. Charges to the ESR are subject to certain limitations which may disallow deferred treatment and which prescribe the timing of recovery. Funding to the ESR is provided as a reduction to the refundable negative salvage balance over its nine-year term beginning December 1, 2010. Subsequent to the nine-year period and subject to APSC authorization, Spire Alabama expects to be able to recover underfunded ESR balances over a five-year amortization period with an annual limitation of $0.7. Amounts in excess of this limitation are deferred for recovery in future years.\nSpire Alabama has APSC approval for an intercompany revolving credit agreement allowing Spire Alabama to borrow from Spire in a principal amount not to exceed $200.0 at any time outstanding in combination with its bank line of credit, and to loan to Spire in a principal amount not to exceed $25.0 at any time outstanding. Borrowings may be used for the following purposes: (a) meeting increased working capital requirements; (b) financing construction requirements related to additions, extensions, and replacements of the distribution systems; and (c) financing other expenditures that may arise from time to time in the normal course of business. In fiscal 2019, the APSC approved Spire Alabama\u2019s applications for $90.0 and $100.0 of long-term debt financing (issued January 15, 2019, and December 2, 2019, respectively). On March 24, 2020, the APSC approved an application for up to $150.0 of additional long-term debt financing for Spire Alabama.\nSpire\nIn addition to those discussed above for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, Spire is affected by the following regulatory matters.\nSpire Gulf has similar rate regulation to Spire Alabama. The RSE allowed range of ROE is 10.45% to 10.95% with an adjusting point of 10.7%. The CCM has the same return and similar recovery provisions when expenses exceed or are under a band of +/- 1.50% around the CPI-U inflated O&M per customer expense level from 2017, excluding expenses for pensions and gas bad debt. Additionally, it has a Cast Iron Main Replacement factor that provides an enhanced return on the pro-rata costs associated with cast iron main replacement exceeding 10 miles per year based on a 75% weighting for the equity content. Spire Gulf also has an ESR for negative revenue variances over $0.1 or a force majeure event expense of $0.1 (or two events that exceed $0.15), a Self Insurance Reserve for general liability coverage, and an Environmental Cost Recovery Factor that recovers 90% of prudently incurred costs for compliance with environmental laws, rules and regulations. It also has an APSC-approved intercompany revolving credit agreement with Spire to borrow in a principal amount not to exceed $50.0, and to loan up to $25.0. Spire Gulf recorded a July 31, 2020, point of test refund under the RSE rate mechanism for approximately $1.4 and also recorded a CCM benefit for rate year 2020 of $1.8. On October 23, 2020, Spire Gulf made its annual RSE rate filing with the APSC based on its budget for fiscal 2021 and an allowed ROE of 10.7%, reflecting an increase in annual revenue of $1.1, pending APSC review.\nSpire Gulf\u2019s rates were reduced $1.9 effective February 1, 2018, to reflect lower income taxes resulting from the TCJA.\nSpire Mississippi utilizes a formula rate-making process under the Rate Stabilization Adjustment (RSA) Rider. It is based on a formulaically derived return on equity (currently 9.79%), and is updated on an annual basis if the equity return on an end of period rate base is beyond the allowed return on equity by 1.0%, with 75% of any shortfall recovered through a rate increase and 50% of any excess resulting in a rate decrease. Updates may include known and measurable adjustments to historic costs from the 12 months ended June 30, submitted September 15 for an effective date of November 1, unless disputed by the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff (MPUS), with any disputes to be resolved by the MSPSC by January 15 of the following year. In December 2015, a Supplemental Growth Rider (SGR) was approved for a 3-year period to provide recovery of certain system expansion projects. On September 4, 2018, the SGR was extended to October 15, 2021. On February 5, 2019, the MSPSC approved an agreement between Spire Mississippi and the MPUS settling its Rates Stabilization and Adjustments filing that was made on September 14, 2018, resulting in a $0.7 increase in the annualized revenue requirement. New rates became effective March 1, 2019. On December 11, 2019, the MSPSC approved an agreement between Spire Mississippi and the MPUS settling its RSA filing that was made on August 30, 2019, resulting in a $0.3 increase in annual revenue. New rates became effective December 11, 2019. On August 28, 2020, Spire Mississippi filed its RSA for the rate year ended June 30, 2020, that reflected an increase to annual revenue totaling $0.6. This RSA filing is being reviewed by the MPUS.\nIn August 2018, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved an order issuing a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the Spire STL Pipeline (\u201cAugust 2018 Order\u201d), and in November 2018, the FERC issued a Notice to Proceed, allowing construction to begin. In November 2019, Spire STL Pipeline received FERC authorization to place the STL Pipeline into service. Also, in November 2019, the FERC issued an Order on Rehearing of the August 2018 Order dismissing or denying the outstanding requests for rehearing filed by several parties, dismissing the request for stay filed by one party, and noting the withdrawal of the request for rehearing by another party. On January 21, 2020, two of the rehearing parties filed petitions for review of the FERC\u2019s orders with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Spire STL Pipeline and Spire Missouri have intervened and filed responsive briefs in this proceeding, which remains pending.\nIn August 2019, Spire Storage filed with the FERC two Prior Notice Applications of its intent to convert a total of six existing observation wells into injection/withdrawal wells and to install related gas flowlines, fuel gas lines and fiber optic communication. The applications cleared FERC authorization in October and November 2019, and both projects remain under development. On October 9, 2020, Spire Storage filed with the FERC an Abbreviated Application for an Amendment of Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, Reaffirmation of Market-Based Rate Authority, and Related Authorizations pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act. The application requests authorization to expand capacity and increase pipeline connectivity at certain of Spire Storage\u2019s natural gas storage facilities in Wyoming.\n16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCommitments\nThe Company and the Utilities have entered into contracts with various counterparties, expiring on dates through 2032, for the storage, transportation, and supply of natural gas. Minimum payments required under the contracts in place at September 30, 2020, are estimated at $1,745.4, $1,410.3 and $229.7 for the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. Additional contracts are generally entered into prior to or during the heating season of November through April. The Utilities recover their costs from customers in accordance with their PGA clauses or GSA riders.\nSpire NGL Inc. is providing liquid propane transportation service to Spire Missouri pursuant to an approved FERC tariff and a contractual arrangement with Spire Missouri. In accordance with the terms of that agreement, Spire Missouri is obligated to pay Spire NGL Inc. approximately $1.0 annually, at current rates. The agreement will terminate March 31, 2021.\nA consolidated subsidiary is a general partner in an unconsolidated partnership that invests in real estate partnerships. The subsidiary and third parties are jointly and severally liable for the payment of mortgage loans in the aggregate outstanding amount of approximately $1.2 incurred in connection with various real estate ventures. Spire has no reason to believe that the other principal liable parties will not be able to meet their proportionate share of these obligations. Spire further believes that the asset values of the real estate properties are sufficient to support these mortgage loans.\nContingencies\nThe Company and the Utilities account for contingencies, including environmental liabilities, in accordance with accounting standards under the loss contingency guidance of ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nIn addition to matters noted below, the Company and the Utilities are involved in other litigation, claims, and investigations arising in the normal course of business. Management, after discussion with counsel, believes the final outcome will not have a material effect on the statements of income, balance sheets, and statements of cash flows of the Company, Spire Missouri, or Spire Alabama. However, there is uncertainty in the valuation of pending claims and prediction of litigation results.\nThe Company and the Utilities own and operate natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage facilities, the operations of which are subject to various environmental laws, regulations, and interpretations. While environmental issues resulting from such operations arise in the ordinary course of business, such issues have not materially affected the Company\u2019s or Utilities\u2019 financial position and results of operations. As environmental laws, regulations, and their interpretations change, the Company or the Utilities may incur additional environmental liabilities that may result in additional costs, which may be material.\nIn the natural gas industry, many gas distribution companies have incurred environmental liabilities associated with sites they or their predecessor companies formerly owned or operated where manufactured gas operations took place. The Utilities each have former manufactured gas plant (MGP) operations in their respective service territories. To the extent costs are incurred associated with environmental remediation activities, the Utilities would request authority from their respective regulators to defer such costs (less any amounts received from insurance proceeds or as contributions from other potentially responsible parties (PRPs)) and collect them through future rates.\nSpire Missouri\nSpire Missouri has identified three former MGP sites in the city of St. Louis, Missouri (the \u201cCity\u201d) where costs have been incurred and claims have been asserted. Spire Missouri has enrolled two of the sites in the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) Brownfields/Voluntary Cleanup Program (BVCP). The third site is the result of a relatively new claim assertion by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\nIn conjunction with redevelopment of one of the sites, Spire Missouri and another former owner of the site entered into an agreement (the \u201cRemediation Agreement\u201d) with the City development agencies, the developer, and an environmental consultant that obligates one of the City agencies and the environmental consultant to remediate the site and obtain a No Further Action letter from the MDNR. The Remediation Agreement also provides for a release of Spire Missouri and the other former site owner from certain liabilities related to the past and current environmental condition of the site and requires the developer and the environmental consultant to maintain certain insurance coverage, including remediation cost containment, premises pollution liability, and professional liability. The operative provisions of the Remediation Agreement were triggered on December 20, 2010, on which date Spire Missouri and the other former site owner, as full consideration under the Remediation Agreement, paid a small percentage of the cost of remediation of the site.\nSpire Missouri has not owned the second site for many years. In a letter dated June 29, 2011, the Attorney General for the State of Missouri informed Spire Missouri that the MDNR had completed an investigation of the site. The Attorney General requested that Spire Missouri participate in the follow up investigations of the site. In a letter dated January 10, 2012, Spire Missouri stated that it would participate in future environmental response activities at the site in conjunction with other PRPs that are willing to contribute to such efforts in a meaningful and equitable fashion. Accordingly, Spire Missouri entered into a cost sharing agreement for remedial investigation with other PRPs. To date, MDNR has not approved the agreement, so remedial investigation has not yet occurred.\nAdditionally, in correspondence dated November 30, 2016, Region 7 of the EPA has asserted that Spire Missouri is liable under Section 107(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) for alleged coal gas waste contamination at a third site in the northern portion of the City on which Spire Missouri operated a MGP. Spire Missouri has not owned or operated the site (also known as Station \u201cB\u201d) for over 70 years. Spire Missouri and the site owner have met with the EPA and reviewed its assertions. Both Spire Missouri and the site owner have notified the EPA that information and data provided by the EPA to date does not rise to the level of documenting a threat to the public health or environment. As such, Spire Missouri requested more information from the EPA, some of which would also be utilized to identify other former owners and operators of the site that could be added as PRPs. To date, Spire Missouri has not received a response from the EPA.\nSpire Missouri has notified its insurers that it seeks reimbursement for costs incurred in the past and future potential liabilities associated with these MGP sites. While some of the insurers have denied coverage and reserved their rights, Spire Missouri retains the right to seek potential reimbursements from them.\nOn March 10, 2015, Spire Missouri received a Section 104(e) information request under CERCLA from EPA Region 7 regarding the former Thompson Chemical/Superior Solvents site in the City. In turn, Spire Missouri issued a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the EPA on April 3, 2015, in an effort to identify the basis of the inquiry. The FOIA response from the EPA was received on July 15, 2015, and a response was provided to the EPA on August 15, 2015. Spire Missouri has received no further inquiry from the EPA regarding this matter.\nIn its western service area, Spire Missouri has seven owned MGP sites enrolled in the BVCP, including Joplin MGP #1, St. Joseph MGP #1, Kansas City Coal Gas Station B, Kansas City Station A Railroad area, Kansas City Coal Gas Station A North, Kansas City Coal Gas Station A South, and Independence MGP #2. Source removal has been conducted at all of the owned sites since 2003 with the exception of Joplin. On September 15, 2016, a request was made with the MDNR for a restrictive covenant use limitation with respect to Joplin. Remediation efforts at the seven sites are at various stages of completion, ranging from groundwater monitoring and sampling following source removal activities to the aforementioned request in respect to Joplin. As part of its participation in the BVCP, Spire Missouri communicates regularly with the MDNR with respect to its remediation efforts and monitoring activities at these sites. On May 11, 2015, MDNR approved the next phase of investigation at the Kansas City Station A North and Railroad areas.\nTo date, costs incurred for all Spire Missouri\u2019s MGP sites for investigation, remediation and monitoring these sites have not been material. However, the amount of costs relative to future remedial actions at these and other sites is unknown and may be material. The actual future costs that Spire Missouri may incur could be materially higher or lower depending upon several factors, including whether remediation will be required, final selection and regulatory approval of any remedial actions, changing technologies and government regulations, the ultimate ability of other PRPs to pay, and any insurance recoveries.\nIn 2013, Spire Missouri retained an outside consultant to conduct probabilistic cost modeling of 19 former MGP sites owned or operated by Spire Missouri. The purpose of this analysis was to develop an estimated range of probabilistic future liability for each site. That analysis, completed in August 2014, provided a range of demonstrated possible future expenditures to investigate, monitor and remediate all 19 MGP sites. Spire Missouri has recorded its best estimate of the probable expenditures that relate to these matters. The amount is not material.\nSpire Missouri and the Company do not expect potential liabilities that may arise from remediating these sites to have a material impact on their future financial condition or results of operations.\nSpire Alabama\nSpire Alabama is in the chain of title of nine former MGP sites, four of which it still owns, and five former manufactured gas distribution sites, one of which it still owns. Spire Alabama does not foresee a probable or reasonably estimable loss associated with these sites. Spire Alabama and the Company do not expect potential liabilities that may arise from remediating these sites to have a material impact on their future financial condition or results of operations.\nIn 2012, Spire Alabama responded to an EPA Request for Information Pursuant to Section 104 of CERCLA relating to the 35th Avenue Superfund Site located in North Birmingham, Jefferson County, Alabama. Spire Alabama was identified as a PRP under CERCLA for the cleanup of the site or costs the EPA incurs in cleaning up the site. At this point, Spire Alabama has not been provided information that would allow it to determine the extent, if any, of its potential liability with respect to the 35th Avenue Superfund Site and vigorously denies its inclusion as a PRP.\nSpire\nIn addition to those discussed above for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, Spire is aware of the following contingent matter.\nIn February 2018, the Company was made aware of a complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) by the South Alabama Center for Fair Housing and the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. The complaint alleges that Spire Gulf discriminated against unspecified residents of Eight Mile, Alabama, on the basis of race in violation of the Fair Housing Act by failing to adequately address the odorant release that occurred in 2008. The Company believes there is no basis for the complaint, HUD has no jurisdiction in the matter, and there will be no material impact on its future financial condition or results of operations.\n17. LEASES\nThe lease agreement covering the Company\u2019s primary office space in St. Louis extends through February 2035, with an option to renew for an additional five years. Spire Alabama\u2019s lease agreement for office space in Birmingham extends through January 2024. The lease agreement covering Spire Marketing and Spire Storage office space in Houston extends through December 2028, with options to terminate three years earlier or to renew for an additional five years. The renewal options in the St. Louis and Houston leases are reasonably certain to be exercised and are included in the lease term used to determine the right-of use assets and lease liabilities. The Company and its subsidiaries have other relatively minor rental arrangements for real estate and equipment with remaining terms of up to ten years.\nOperating lease cost, cash flow and noncash information for the year ended September 30, 2020, are shown in the following table.\nThe following table shows balance sheet and weighted-average information about operating leases as of September 30, 2020.\nFollowing is a maturity analysis by fiscal year for operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2020.\nThe aggregate rental expense for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and the annual minimum rental commitments for all leases having an initial or remaining non-cancelable term of more than one year as of September 30, 2019, were as follows (under ASC 840).\nThere are no significant finance leases, short-term leases, subleases, variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, restrictions or covenants pertaining to leases.\nThe Company elected, for all asset classes, not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases. Instead, the lease payments are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease payments are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The Company elected, for all asset classes, not to separate nonlease components from lease components and instead to account for each separate lease component and the nonlease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component.\nThe discount rate used for all the leases is the applicable incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. For a subsidiary lessee, the rate applicable to the subsidiary is used unless the lease terms are influenced by parent credit.\n18. INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)\nSpire\nIn the opinion of Spire, the quarterly information presented below for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 includes all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for such periods. Variations in consolidated operations reported on a quarterly basis primarily reflect the seasonal nature of the business of the Utilities.\nSpire Missouri\nIn the opinion of Spire Missouri, the quarterly information presented below for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 includes all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for such periods.
