    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nPlease refer to the Glossary of Terms for definitions of defined terms and abbreviations used in this combined Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEversource Energy, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and Hartford, Connecticut, is a public utility holding company subject to regulation by the FERC under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. We are engaged primarily in the energy delivery business through the following wholly-owned utility subsidiaries:\n\u2022The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Connecticut;\n\u2022NSTAR Electric Company (NSTAR Electric), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of eastern and western Massachusetts and owns solar power facilities;\n\u2022Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of New Hampshire;\n\u2022NSTAR Gas Company (NSTAR Gas), a regulated natural gas utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Massachusetts;\n\u2022Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts (EGMA), a regulated natural gas utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Massachusetts;\n\u2022Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), a regulated natural gas utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Connecticut; and\n\u2022Eversource Aquarion Holdings, Inc. (Aquarion), a utility holding company that owns three separate regulated water utility subsidiaries and collectively serves residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal and fire protection customers in parts of Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH also serve New England customers through Eversource Energy's electric transmission business. Along with NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas, each is doing business as Eversource Energy in its respective service territory.\nOn October 9, 2020, Eversource acquired certain assets and liabilities that comprised NiSource Inc.\u2019s natural gas distribution business in Massachusetts, which was previously doing business as Columbia Gas of Massachusetts (CMA). The natural gas distribution assets acquired from CMA were assigned to EGMA, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Eversource formed in 2020. The LNG assets acquired from CMA were assigned to Hopkinton LNG Corp.\nEversource Energy, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each report their financial results separately. We also include information in this report on a segment basis for Eversource Energy. Eversource Energy has four reportable segments: electric distribution, electric transmission, natural gas distribution and water distribution. These segments represent substantially all of Eversource Energy's total consolidated revenues. CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH do not report separate business segments.\nELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT\nEversource Energy's electric distribution segment consists of the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, which are engaged in the distribution of electricity to retail customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, respectively, and the solar power facilities of NSTAR Electric.\nELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION - CONNECTICUT - THE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY\nCL&P's distribution business consists primarily of the purchase, delivery and sale of electricity to its residential, commercial and industrial customers. As of December 31, 2020, CL&P furnished retail franchise electric service to approximately 1.27 million customers in 149 cities and towns in Connecticut, covering an area of approximately 4,400 square miles. CL&P does not own any electric generation facilities.\nRates\nCL&P is subject to regulation by the PURA, which, among other things, has jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities. CL&P's present general rate structure consists of various rate and service classifications covering residential, commercial and industrial services. CL&P's retail rates include a delivery service component, which includes distribution, transmission, conservation, renewable energy programs and other charges that are assessed on all customers.\nUnder Connecticut law, all of CL&P's customers are entitled to choose their energy suppliers, while CL&P remains their electric distribution company. For those customers who do not choose a competitive energy supplier, under SS rates for customers with less than 500 kilowatts of demand (residential customers and small and medium commercial and industrial customers), and LRS rates for customers with 500 kilowatts or more of demand (larger commercial and industrial customers), CL&P purchases power under standard offer contracts and passes the cost of the purchased power to customers through a combined charge on customers' bills.\nThe rates established by the PURA for CL&P are comprised of the following:\n\u2022An electric GSC, which recovers energy-related costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers that have not migrated to competitive energy suppliers. The GSC is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n\u2022A revenue decoupling adjustment that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by the PURA of $1.099 billion effective May 1, 2018, $1.127 billion effective May 1, 2019, and $1.158 billion effective May 1, 2020. These pre-established levels of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirements are also subject to adjustment at each of these dates in accordance with provisions of the April 2018 rate case settlement agreement.\n\u2022A distribution charge, which includes a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge to collect the costs of building and expanding the infrastructure to deliver electricity to customers, as well as ongoing operating costs to maintain the infrastructure.\n\u2022An Electric System Improvements (ESI) charge, which collects the costs of building and expanding the infrastructure to deliver electricity to customers above the level recovered through the distribution charge. The ESI also recovers costs associated with CL&P\u2019s system resiliency program, which was implemented as part of CL&P's rate case settlement agreement that was approved by PURA in April 2018. The ESI is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n\u2022An FMCC, which recovers any costs imposed by the FERC as part of the New England Standard Market Design, including locational marginal pricing, locational installed capacity payments, any costs approved by the PURA to reduce these charges, as well as other costs approved by PURA. The FMCC has both a bypassable component and a non-bypassable component, and is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n\u2022A transmission charge that recovers the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generating plants to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market. The transmission charge is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by the PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n\u2022A CTA charge, assessed to recover stranded costs associated with electric industry restructuring such as various IPP contracts. The CTA is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n\u2022An SBC, established to fund expenses associated with various hardship and low-income programs. The SBC is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n\u2022A Renewable Energy Investment Charge, which is used to promote investment in renewable energy sources. Amounts collected by this charge are deposited into the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund and administered by the Connecticut Green Bank.\n\u2022A Conservation Adjustment Mechanism (CAM) charge established to implement cost-effective energy conservation programs and market transformation initiatives. The CAM charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by the PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers through an approved adjustment to the following year\u2019s energy conservation spending plan budget.\nAs required by regulation, CL&P has entered into long-term contracts for the purchase of (i) products from renewable energy facilities, which may include energy, renewable energy certificates, or capacity, (ii) capacity-related contracts with generation facilities, and (iii) contracts for peaking capacity. Some of these contracts are subject to sharing agreements with UI, whereby CL&P is responsible for 80 percent and UI for 20 percent of the net costs or benefits. CL&P's portion of the costs and benefits of these contracts will be paid by, or refunded to, CL&P's customers.\nDistribution Rate Case: CL&P's distribution rates were established in an April 2018 PURA-approved rate case settlement agreement with rates effective May 1, 2018, and incremental step adjustments effective May 1, 2019 and May 1, 2020.\nSources and Availability of Electric Power Supply\nAs noted above, CL&P does not own any generation assets and purchases energy supply to serve its SS and LRS loads from a variety of competitive sources through requests for proposals. During 2020, CL&P supplied approximately 51 percent of its customer load at SS or LRS rates while the other 49 percent of its customer load had migrated to competitive energy suppliers. In terms of the total number of CL&P customers, this equates to 23 percent being on competitive supply, while 77 percent remain with SS or LRS. Because this customer migration is only for energy supply service, it has no impact on CL&P's electric distribution business or its operating income.\nCL&P periodically enters into full requirements contracts for SS loads for periods of up to one year. CL&P typically enters into full requirements contracts for LRS loads every three months. Currently, CL&P has full requirements contracts in place for 100 percent of its SS loads for the first half of 2021. For the second half of 2021, CL&P has 40 percent of its SS load under full requirements contracts and intends to purchase an additional 60 percent of full requirements. None of the SS load for 2022 has been procured. CL&P has full requirements contracts in place for its LRS loads through March 2021 and intends to purchase 100 percent of full requirements for the remainder of 2021.\nELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION - MASSACHUSETTS - NSTAR ELECTRIC COMPANY\nNSTAR Electric's distribution business consists primarily of the purchase, delivery and sale of electricity to its residential, commercial and industrial customers. As of December 31, 2020, NSTAR Electric furnished retail franchise electric service to approximately 1.45 million customers in Boston and 139 cities and towns in eastern and western Massachusetts, including Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and the greater Springfield metropolitan area, covering an aggregate area of approximately 3,200 square miles.\nNSTAR Electric does not own any generating facilities that are used to supply customers, and purchases its energy requirements from competitive energy suppliers.\nNSTAR Electric owns, operates and maintains a total of 70 MW of solar power facilities on twenty-two sites in Massachusetts. NSTAR Electric will sell energy from these facilities into the ISO-NE market, with proceeds credited to customers.\nRates\nNSTAR Electric is subject to regulation by the DPU, which, among other things, has jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, acquisition of securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities. The present general rate structure for NSTAR Electric consists of various rate and service classifications covering residential, commercial and industrial services.\nUnder Massachusetts law, all customers of NSTAR Electric are entitled to choose their energy suppliers, while NSTAR Electric remains their electric distribution company. NSTAR Electric purchases power from competitive suppliers on behalf of, and passes the related cost through to, its customers who do not choose a competitive energy supplier (basic service). Electric distribution companies in Massachusetts are required to obtain and resell power to retail customers through basic service for those who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier. Most of the residential customers of NSTAR Electric have continued to buy their power from NSTAR Electric at basic service rates. Most commercial and industrial customers have switched to a competitive energy supplier.\nThe Cape Light Compact, an inter-governmental organization consisting of the 21 towns and two counties on Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard, serves 200,000 customers through the delivery of energy efficiency programs, consumer advocacy, competitive electricity supply and green power options. NSTAR Electric continues to provide electric service to these customers including the delivery of power, maintenance of infrastructure, capital investment, meter reading, billing, and customer service.\nThe rates established by the DPU for NSTAR Electric are comprised of the following:\n\u2022A basic service charge that represents the collection of energy costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers that have not migrated to competitive energy suppliers, including costs related to charge-offs of uncollectible energy costs from customers. Basic service rates are reset every six months (every three months for large commercial and industrial customers). Additionally, the DPU has authorized NSTAR Electric to recover the cost of its NSTAR Green wind contracts through the basic service charge. Basic service costs are reconciled annually, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n\u2022A distribution charge, which includes a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge to collect the costs of building and expanding the distribution infrastructure to deliver electricity to its destination, as well as ongoing operating costs.\n\u2022A revenue decoupling adjustment that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by the DPU of $956 million on an annualized basis for 2018, $988 million for 2019, and $1.022 billion for 2020. Annual base distribution amounts are adjusted for inflation and filed for approval by the DPU on an annual basis, until the next rate case.\n\u2022A transmission charge that recovers the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generating plants to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market. The transmission charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n\u2022A transition charge that represents costs to be collected primarily from previously held investments in generating plants, costs related to existing above-market power contracts, and contract costs related to long-term power contract buy-outs. The transition charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n\u2022A renewable energy charge that represents a legislatively-mandated charge to support the Massachusetts Renewable Energy Trust Fund.\n\u2022An energy efficiency charge that represents a legislatively-mandated charge to collect costs for energy efficiency programs. The energy efficiency charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n\u2022Reconciling adjustment charges that recover certain DPU-approved costs, including pension and PBOP benefits, low income customer discounts, credits issued to net-metering facilities installed by customers, payments to solar facilities qualified under the state solar renewable energy target program, attorney general consultant expenses, long-term renewable contracts, company-owned solar facilities, vegetation management costs, credits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, grid modernization costs, and storm restoration. These charges are reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nNSTAR Electric has signed long-term commitments for the purchase of energy from renewable energy facilities.\nDistribution Rate Case: NSTAR Electric's distribution rates were established in a 2017 DPU-approved rate case with rates effective February 1, 2018. DPU-approved inflation-based adjustments to annual base distribution amounts were effective January 1, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\nService Quality Metrics: NSTAR Electric is subject to service quality (SQ) metrics that measure safety, reliability and customer service, and could be required to pay to customers a SQ charge of up to 2.5 percent of annual transmission and distribution revenues for failing to meet such metrics. NSTAR Electric will not be required to pay a SQ charge for its 2020 performance as the company achieved results at or above target for all of its SQ metrics in 2020.\nSources and Availability of Electric Power Supply\nAs noted above, NSTAR Electric does not own any generation assets (other than 70 MW of solar power facilities that produce energy that is sold into the ISO-NE market) and purchases its energy requirements from a variety of competitive sources through requests for proposals issued periodically, consistent with DPU regulations. NSTAR Electric enters into supply contracts for basic service for approximately 45 percent of its residential and small commercial and industrial (C&I) customers twice per year for twelve-month terms. NSTAR Electric enters into supply contracts for basic service for 18 percent of large C&I customers every three months.\nDuring 2020, NSTAR Electric supplied approximately 42 percent of its residential customer load, 29 percent of its small C&I customer load, and 6 percent of its large C&I customer load at basic service rates. The remainder of its customer load was distributed between municipal aggregation and competitive supply. Because customer migration is limited to energy supply service, it has no impact on NSTAR Electric\u2019s electric distribution business or operating income of NSTAR Electric.\nELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION - NEW HAMPSHIRE - PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\nPSNH's distribution business consists primarily of the purchase, delivery and sale of electricity to its residential, commercial and industrial customers. As of December 31, 2020, PSNH furnished retail franchise electric service to approximately 528,000 retail customers in 211 cities and towns in New Hampshire, covering an area of approximately 5,630 square miles.\nOn January 10, 2018, PSNH completed the sale of its thermal generation assets pursuant to a 2017 purchase and sale agreement. The thermal generation facilities included approximately 1,100 MW of coal, natural gas, biomass and oil-fired electricity generation facilities. On August 26, 2018, PSNH completed the sale of its hydroelectric generation assets pursuant to a separate 2017 purchase and sale agreement. For further information, see \"Generation Divestiture\" below. As of December 31, 2020, PSNH does not own any electric generation facilities.\nRates\nPSNH is subject to regulation by the NHPUC, which, among other things, has jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.\nUnder New Hampshire law, all of PSNH's customers are entitled to choose competitive energy suppliers. During 2020, approximately 21 percent of all of PSNH's customers (approximately 53 percent of load) were taking service from competitive energy suppliers.\nThe rates established by the NHPUC for PSNH are comprised of the following:\n\u2022A default energy service charge recovers energy-related costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers that have not migrated to competitive energy suppliers.\n\u2022A distribution charge, which includes kilowatt-hour and/or demand-based charges to recover costs related to the maintenance and operation of PSNH's infrastructure to deliver power to its destination, as well as power restoration and service costs. It also includes a customer charge to collect the cost of providing service to a customer; such as the installation, maintenance, reading and replacement of meters and maintaining accounts and records.\n\u2022A transmission charge that recovers the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generating plants to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market.\n\u2022An SCRC, which allows PSNH to recover its stranded costs, including above-market expenses incurred under mandated power purchase obligations, other long-term investments and obligations, and the remaining costs associated with the 2018 sales of its generation facilities.\n\u2022An SBC, which funds energy efficiency programs for all customers, as well as assistance programs for residential customers within certain income guidelines.\n\u2022A new Regulatory Reconciliation Adjustment (RRA) that reconciles the difference between certain estimated and actual costs included in base distribution rates, including costs related to regulatory assessments, vegetation management program expenses, property tax expenses, storm cost amortization updated for the actual cost of long-term debt and lost base revenues related to net metering.\nPSNH has signed long-term commitments for the purchase of energy from renewable energy facilities.\nThe default energy service charge and SCRC rates change semi-annually and the transmission and SBC rates change annually. These rates are reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the NHPUC, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nDistribution Rate Case: On June 27, 2019, the NHPUC approved a settlement agreement that was reached by PSNH, the NHPUC Staff, the Office of the Consumer Advocate, and another settling party, to implement a temporary annual base distribution rate increase of $28.3 million. Although new rates were implemented on August 1, 2019 to customers, the provisions of the temporary base distribution rate increase were effective July 1, 2019. The settlement agreement also permitted PSNH to recover approximately $68.5 million in unrecovered storm costs over a five-year period beginning August 1, 2019, with debt carrying charges, which is included in the temporary rate increase.\nOn May 28, 2019, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC for a permanent increase in base distribution rates of approximately $70 million, effective July 1, 2020, which included the temporary rate increase request. Temporary rates remained in effect with a reconciliation of permanent rates retroactive to July 1, 2019 once permanent rates were set.\nOn December 15, 2020, the NHPUC approved an October 9, 2020 settlement agreement on permanent rates between PSNH and all parties to the proceeding. The NHPUC approved a permanent rate increase of $45.0 million effective January 1, 2021, inclusive of the temporary rate increase referenced above. PSNH was also permitted three step increases, effective January 1, 2021, August 1, 2021, and August 1, 2022, to reflect plant additions in calendar years 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. On December 23, 2020, the NHPUC approved the first step adjustment for 2019 plant in service to recover a revenue requirement of $10.6 million, subject to reconciliation after completion of an audit, effective January 1, 2021. The settlement agreement also established an authorized regulatory ROE of 9.3 percent with a 54.4 percent common equity ratio in PSNH\u2019s capital structure and provided for a new tracker to recover regulatory assessments, vegetation management costs, property tax costs, and lost distribution revenue attributable to net metering.\nGeneration Divestiture\nOn January 10, 2018, PSNH completed the sale of its thermal generation assets. The original purchase price of $175 million was adjusted to reflect working capital adjustments, closing date adjustments and proration of taxes and fees prior to closing. As a result of these adjustments, net proceeds from the sale of the thermal assets totaled $116.8 million. On August 26, 2018, PSNH completed the sale of its hydroelectric generation assets. The original purchase price of $83 million was adjusted to reflect contractual adjustments, resulting in net proceeds of $77.2 million. The difference between the carrying value of the hydroelectric generation assets and the sale proceeds resulted in a gain of $17.3 million. An estimated gain from the sale of these assets was included as an offset to the total remaining costs associated with the sale of generation assets that were securitized on May 8, 2018.\nOn May 8, 2018, PSNH Funding issued $635.7 million of securitized RRBs pursuant to a finance order issued by the NHPUC on January 30, 2018 to recover remaining costs resulting from the divestiture of PSNH\u2019s generation assets, which included the deferred costs resulting from the sale of the thermal generation assets. These RRBs are secured by a non-bypassable charge recoverable from PSNH customers. PSNH recorded regulatory assets and other deferred costs in connection with the generation asset divestiture and the securitization of remaining costs, which are probable of recovery through collection of the non-bypassable charge.\nOn May 15, 2020, the NHPUC Audit Staff issued a final report on the audit of PSNH\u2019s generation asset divestiture-related costs and resulting securitized and stranded costs. The findings in the audit report as well as other aspects of the divestiture process were further investigated by NHPUC Staff through the discovery phase, which was completed in July 2020. On September 30, 2020, PSNH filed a settlement agreement on the generation asset divestiture-related costs with the NHPUC Audit Staff. The settlement agreement resolved all issues with respect to PSNH\u2019s divestiture of its generating assets and the recovery of $12.0 million of divestiture-related costs incurred above the $635.7 million amount previously securitized. On December 17, 2020, the NHPUC approved the additional $12.0 million proposed in the settlement agreement to be recovered over a one-year period through the SCRC rate beginning February 1, 2021.\nSources and Availability of Electric Power Supply\nPSNH does not own any generation assets and purchases energy supply from a variety of competitive suppliers for its energy service customers through requests for proposals issued twice per year, for six-month terms, for approximately 80 percent of its residential and small C&I customers and for 15 percent of its large C&I customers.\nDuring 2020, PSNH supplied approximately 46 percent of its customer load at default energy service rates while the other 54 percent of its customer load had migrated to competitive energy suppliers. Because this customer migration is only for energy supply service, it has no impact on PSNH\u2019s electric distribution business or its operating income.\nELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SEGMENT\nEach of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH owns and maintains transmission facilities that are part of an interstate power transmission grid over which electricity is transmitted throughout New England. Each of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, and most other New England utilities, are parties to a series of agreements that provide for coordinated planning and operation of the region's transmission facilities and the rules by which they acquire transmission services. Under these arrangements, ISO-NE, a non-profit corporation whose board of directors and staff are independent of all market participants, serves as the regional transmission organization of the New England transmission system.\nWholesale Transmission Rates\nWholesale transmission revenues are recovered through FERC-approved formula rates. Annual transmission revenue requirements include recovery of transmission costs and include a return on equity applied to transmission rate base. Transmission revenues are collected from New England customers, including distribution customers of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH. The transmission rates provide for an annual true-up of estimated to actual costs. The financial impacts of differences between actual and estimated costs are deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, transmission customers.\nFERC ROE Complaints\nFour separate complaints were filed at the FERC by combinations of New England state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, consumer advocates, consumer groups, municipal parties and other parties (collectively the \"Complainants\"). In each of the first three complaints, filed on October 1, 2011, December 27, 2012, and July 31, 2014, respectively, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE of 11.14 percent that had been utilized since 2005 and sought an order to reduce it prospectively from the date of the final FERC order and for the separate 15-month complaint periods. In the fourth complaint, filed April 29, 2016, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE billed of 10.57 percent and the maximum ROE for transmission incentive (incentive cap) of 11.74 percent, asserting that these ROEs were unjust and unreasonable.\nIn response to appeals of the FERC decision in the first complaint filed by the NETOs and the Complainants, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the Court) issued a decision on April 14, 2017 vacating and remanding the FERC's decision. On October 16, 2018, FERC issued an order on all four complaints describing how it intends to address the issues that were remanded by the Court. FERC proposed a new framework to determine (1) whether an existing ROE is unjust and unreasonable and, if so, (2) how to calculate a replacement ROE.\nOn November 21, 2019, FERC issued Opinion No. 569 affecting the two pending transmission ROE complaints against the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) transmission owners, in which FERC adopted a new methodology for determining base ROEs. Various parties sought rehearing. On December 23, 2019, the NETOs filed supplementary materials in the NETOs' four pending cases to respond to this new methodology because of the uncertainty of the applicability to the NETOs' cases. On May 21, 2020, the FERC issued its order in Opinion No. 569-A on the rehearing of the MISO transmission owners' cases, in which FERC again changed its methodology for determining the MISO transmission owners' base ROEs. Various parties appealed the MISO transmission owners' opinion. On November 19, 2020, the FERC issued Opinion No. 569-B denying rehearing of Opinion No. 569-A and reaffirmed the methodology previously adopted in Opinion No. 569-A. The new methodology differs significantly from the methodology proposed by FERC in its October 16, 2018 order to determine the NETOs' base ROEs in its four pending cases.\nGiven the significant uncertainty regarding the applicability of the FERC opinions in the MISO transmission owners' two complaint cases to the NETOs' pending four complaint cases, Eversource concluded that there is no reasonable basis for a change to the reserve or recognized ROEs for any of the complaint periods at this time. As well, Eversource cannot reasonably estimate a range of any gain or loss for any of the four complaint proceedings at this time.\nFor further information, see \"FERC Regulatory Matters - FERC ROE Complaints\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nTransmission Projects\nDuring 2020, we were involved in the planning, development and construction of a series of electric transmission projects that enhance system reliability and improve capacity. For more information on transmission projects, see \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures - Electric Transmission Business\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nNorthern Pass was Eversource's planned 1,090 MW HVDC transmission line that would have interconnected from the Qu\u00e9bec-New Hampshire border to Franklin, New Hampshire and an associated alternating current radial transmission line between Franklin and Deerfield, New Hampshire. As a result of a final decision received on July 19, 2019 from the New Hampshire Supreme Court, whereby the court denied Northern Pass\u2019 appeal and affirmed the NHSEC\u2019s denial of Northern Pass\u2019 siting application on NPT, Eversource concluded that construction of NPT was no longer probable and that there was no constructive path forward for the project. In 2019, Eversource terminated the project and permanently abandoned any further development. As a result, substantially all of the capitalized project costs, which totaled $318 million, certain of which were subject to cost reimbursement agreements, were impaired. In total, this resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $239.6 million within Operating Income on the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2019, and was reflected in the Electric Transmission segment. For further information, see \"Critical Accounting Policies - Impairment of Northern Pass Transmission\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nTransmission Rate Base\nTransmission rate base under our FERC-approved tariff primarily consists of our investment in transmission net utility plant less accumulated deferred income taxes. Under our FERC-approved tariff, and with the exception of transmission projects that received specific FERC approval to include CWIP in rate base, transmission projects generally enter rate base after they are placed in commercial operation. At the end of 2020, our estimated transmission rate base was approximately $8.0 billion, including approximately $3.6 billion at CL&P, $3.1 billion at NSTAR Electric, and $1.3 billion at PSNH.\nNATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT\nOn October 9, 2020, Eversource acquired certain assets and liabilities that comprised NiSource\u2019s natural gas distribution business in Massachusetts, which was previously doing business as CMA, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement (the Agreement) entered into on February 26, 2020 between Eversource and NiSource Inc. (NiSource). The cash purchase price was $1.1 billion, plus a target working capital amount of $69.6 million, which is subject to adjustment to reflect actual working capital as of the closing date that has not yet been finalized. Eversource financed the asset acquisition through a combination of debt and equity issuances in a ratio that was consistent with our consolidated capital structure. The natural gas distribution assets acquired from CMA were assigned to Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts (EGMA), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Eversource formed in 2020. The LNG assets acquired from CMA were assigned to Hopkinton LNG Corp.\nNSTAR Gas distributes natural gas to approximately 303,000 customers in 51 communities in central and eastern Massachusetts covering 1,067 square miles. EGMA distributes natural gas to approximately 332,000 customers in 65 communities throughout Massachusetts covering 1,206 square miles. Yankee Gas distributes natural gas to approximately 246,000 customers in 74 cities and towns in Connecticut covering 2,632 square miles. Total throughput (sales and transportation) in 2020 was approximately 66.9 Bcf for NSTAR Gas, 54.9 Bcf for EGMA, and 54.6 Bcf for Yankee Gas. Our natural gas businesses provide firm natural gas sales and transportation service to eligible retail customers who require a continuous natural gas supply throughout the year, such as residential customers who rely on natural gas for heating, hot water and cooking needs, as well as commercial and industrial customers that rely on natural gas for space heating, hot water, cooking and commercial and industrial applications.\nA portion of the storage of natural gas supply for NSTAR Gas and EGMA during the winter heating season is provided by Hopkinton LNG Corp., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Eversource Energy. NSTAR Gas has access to facilities consisting of a LNG liquefaction and vaporization plant and three above-ground cryogenic storage tanks having an aggregate capacity of 3.0 Bcf of liquefied natural gas and facilities that include additional storage capacity of 0.5 Bcf. Total vaporization capacity of these facilities is 0.21 Bcf per day. EGMA has access to approximately 1.8 Bcf of LNG and 0.2 Bcf of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) storage, with a total vaporization capacity of 0.17 Bcf per day. Yankee Gas owns a 1.2 Bcf LNG facility, which also has the ability to liquefy and vaporize up to 0.1 Bcf per day. This facility is used primarily to assist Yankee Gas in meeting its supplier-of-last-resort obligations and also enables it to provide economic supply and make economic refill of natural gas, typically during periods of low demand.\nNSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas generate revenues primarily through the sale and/or transportation of natural gas. All NSTAR Gas and EGMA retail customers have the ability to choose to purchase gas from third party marketers under the Massachusetts Retail Choice program. In the past year in Massachusetts, Retail Choice represented only approximately one percent of the total residential load, while Retail Choice represented approximately 59 percent of the total commercial and industrial load. Retail natural gas service in Connecticut is partially unbundled: residential customers in Yankee Gas' service territory buy natural gas supply and delivery only from Yankee Gas while commercial and industrial customers may choose their natural gas suppliers. Firm transportation service is offered to customers who purchase natural gas from sources other than NSTAR Gas, EGMA or Yankee Gas. NSTAR Gas and EGMA have the ability to offer interruptible transportation and interruptible natural gas sales service to high volume commercial and industrial customers. Yankee Gas offers interruptible transportation and interruptible natural gas sales service to commercial and industrial customers that have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel on short notice. NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas can interrupt service to these customers during peak demand periods or at any other time to maintain distribution system integrity.\nRates\nNSTAR Gas and EGMA are subject to regulation by the DPU and Yankee Gas is subject to regulation by PURA, which, among other things, have jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.\nRetail natural gas delivery and supply rates are established by the DPU and the PURA and are comprised of:\n\u2022A distribution charge consisting of a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge that collects the costs of building, maintaining, and expanding the natural gas infrastructure to deliver natural gas supply to its customers. This also includes collection of ongoing operating costs.\n\u2022A seasonal cost of gas adjustment clause (CGAC) at NSTAR Gas and EGMA that collects natural gas supply costs, pipeline and storage capacity costs, costs related to charge-offs of uncollected energy costs and working capital related costs. The CGAC is reset semi-annually with any difference being recovered from, or refunded to, customers during the following corresponding season. In addition, NSTAR Gas and EGMA file interim changes to the CGAC factor when the actual costs of natural gas supply vary from projections by more than five percent.\n\u2022A Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clause, which is evaluated monthly and allows Yankee Gas to recover the costs of the procurement of natural gas for its firm and seasonal customers. Differences between actual natural gas costs and collection amounts from September 1st through August 31st of each PGA year are deferred and then recovered from, or refunded to, customers during the following PGA year. Carrying charges on outstanding balances are calculated using Yankee Gas' weighted average cost of capital in accordance with the directives of the PURA.\n\u2022A local distribution adjustment clause (LDAC) at NSTAR Gas and EGMA that collects all energy efficiency and related program costs, environmental costs, pension and PBOP related costs, attorney general consultant costs, credits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, gas system enhancement program (GSEP) costs and costs associated with low income customers. The LDAC is reset annually with any difference being recovered from, or refunded to, customers during the following period and provides for the recovery of certain costs applicable to both sales and transportation customers.\n\u2022A Conservation Adjustment Mechanism (CAM) at Yankee Gas, which allows 100 percent recovery of conservation costs through this mechanism including program incentives to promote energy efficiency. A reconciliation of CAM revenues to expenses is performed annually with any difference being recovered from, or refunded to, customers with carrying charges during the following year.\n\u2022A Gas System Improvement (GSI) reconciliation mechanism at Yankee Gas, which collects the costs of certain Distribution Integrity Management Program (DIMP) and core capital plant in service above and beyond the level that is recovered through the distribution charge. The GSI is adjusted and reconciled annually, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n\u2022A System Expansion Rate (SER) Reconciliation Mechanism at Yankee Gas, which compares distribution system expansion investment costs and revenues for new customers, with the level projected in current distribution customer rates. This reconciliation is performed annually and customer rates are adjusted accordingly.\n\u2022A Revenue Decoupling Mechanism (RDM) at NSTAR Gas and EGMA that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by the DPU in 2020. The pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement is also subject to adjustment in accordance with provisions of the November 2020 NSTAR Gas distribution rate case and the October 2020 EGMA rate settlement agreement.\n\u2022A RDM at Yankee Gas that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by the PURA effective January 1, 2019, January 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021. The pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement is also subject to adjustment at each of these dates in accordance with provisions of the 2018 rate case settlement agreement.\nNSTAR Gas purchases financial contracts based on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas futures in order to reduce cash flow variability associated with the price for approximately one-third of its normal winter season natural gas supplies. These purchases are made under a program approved by the DPU in 2006. This practice attempts to minimize the impact of fluctuations in natural gas prices to NSTAR Gas' firm natural gas customers. These financial contracts do not procure natural gas supply. All costs incurred or benefits realized when these contracts are settled are included in the CGAC.\nNSTAR Gas is subject to SQ metrics that measure safety, reliability and customer service and could be required to pay to customers a SQ charge of up to 2.5 percent of annual distribution revenues for failing to meet such metrics. NSTAR Gas will not be required to pay a SQ charge for its 2020 performance as it achieved results at or above target for all of its SQ metrics in 2020.\nDistribution Rate Cases:\nNSTAR Gas: On October 30, 2020, the DPU approved a base distribution rate increase of $23.0 million effective November 1, 2020, compared to the original request of $38.0 million. NSTAR Gas' 2019 plant additions are allowed recovery beginning on November 1, 2021. Thus, the reduced revenue requirement reflects the removal of this recovery, among other adjustments. The DPU also approved NSTAR Gas' proposal to continue its ongoing Gas System Enhancement Program (GSEP), the inclusion of GSEP investments since 2015 into base rates, and the implementation of a 10-year performance-based ratemaking plan, which includes an inflation-based adjustment mechanism to annual base distribution rates. The decision allows an authorized regulatory ROE of 9.9 percent on a capital structure including 54.77 percent equity. The decision also approves a geothermal pilot program.\nYankee Gas: Yankee Gas distribution rates were set in a December 2018 PURA approved rate case settlement agreement, with rates effective November 15, 2018. The 2018 Yankee Gas settlement agreement required Yankee Gas to implement a GSI cost recovery mechanism to further invest capital to replace aging infrastructure. The GSI mechanism allows for recovery of costs associated with capital additions of approximately $26 million to $37 million annually, which is incremental to the $150 million included in base distribution rate base per year. The settlement agreement also provides Yankee Gas the opportunity to seek recovery of additional capital spending above these levels with PURA approval. PURA ordered an accelerated replacement program for Yankee Gas to fully replace its cast iron and bare steel facilities in 11 years and fully replace copper services and certain steel mains and services in 14 years from the date of the rate case. Yankee Gas was also authorized to continue its ongoing natural gas system expansion program, implement a revenue decoupling rate mechanism, and recover merger costs. The settlement agreement included a regulatory ROE of 9.3 percent. In addition, the distribution rates charged to customers were adjusted to reflect the prospective impacts of the lower federal corporate income tax rate, the overcollection of the lower income tax rate from January 1, 2018, and the EDIT from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Although new rates were effective January 1, 2019, the provisions of the settlement agreement took effect November 15, 2018. PURA also approved step adjustments effective January 1, 2019, January 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021.\nEGMA: On October 7, 2020, the DPU approved a rate settlement agreement with Eversource, EGMA, NiSource, Bay State, the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, the DOER and the Low-Income Weatherization and Fuel Assistance Program Network, which requested approval of the February 26, 2020 asset purchase agreement between Eversource and NiSource, as well as a rate stabilization plan, among other items. The settlement agreement included an authorized regulatory ROE of 9.70 percent as of January 1, 2021, a 53.25 percent equity component of its capital structure, and established rate base equal to $995 million as of the closing on October 9, 2020.\nThe approved rate stabilization plan includes base distribution rate increases of $13 million on November 1, 2021 and $10 million on November 1, 2022. The settlement agreement includes two rate base resets during an eight-year rate plan, occurring on November 1, 2024 and November 1, 2027. The two rate base resets adjust distribution rates to account for capital additions (including the roll-in of GSEP capital additions), depreciation expense, property taxes, and return on rate base for capital additions placed into service through December 31, 2023, for the first rate base reset occurring on November 1, 2024, and through December 31, 2026, for the second rate base reset occurring on November 1, 2027. Notwithstanding the two distribution rate increases, the two rate base reset provisions, and potential adjustments for qualifying exogenous events, EGMA agreed not to file for an increase or redesign of distribution base rates effective prior to November 1, 2028.\nThe settlement agreement also permits EGMA to seek recovery of both transaction and integration costs as a result of the asset acquisition after December 31, 2026, subject to DPU review and approval, and subject to certain conditions, such as demonstrating savings resulting from the acquisition.\nNatural Gas Replacement and Expansion\nMassachusetts: Pursuant to Massachusetts legislation, in October of each year, NSTAR Gas and EGMA file GSEP Plans with the DPU for the following construction year. The GSEP Program is designed to accelerate the replacement of certain natural gas distribution facilities in the system to less than 25 years. The GSEP includes a tariff that provides NSTAR Gas and EGMA an opportunity to collect the costs for the program on an annual basis through a reconciling factor. On April 30th each year, the DPU approves the GSEP rate recovery factor that goes into effect on May 1st.\nNSTAR Gas' distribution rate case application filed on November 8, 2019 included a proposal to include GSEP additions through 2018 into base distribution rates and to continue the operation of the GSEP mechanism for GSEP investments made after 2018. In addition, the filing included a proposal for a customer connection surcharge, which would be used to reduce up-front contribution in aid of construction (CIAC) costs for customers seeking to connect to the company\u2019s distribution system. On October 30, 2020, the DPU approved the Company\u2019s customer connection surcharge proposal, allowing the surcharge to be implemented beginning November 1, 2021.\nConnecticut: Yankee Gas' December 2018 PURA approved rate case settlement agreement included an accelerated pipeline replacement cost recovery program. The Gas System Improvement (GSI) rate recovers accelerated pipeline replacement as well as other capital investment through an annual reconciliation. The Company filed its first GSI reconciliation on March 1, 2019 for rates effective April 1, 2019 and will continue to file annually on March 1 for rates effective April 1.\nIn 2013, in accordance with Connecticut law and regulations, the PURA approved a comprehensive joint natural gas infrastructure expansion plan (the \"Expansion Plan\") filed by Yankee Gas and other Connecticut natural gas distribution companies. In January 2015, the PURA approved a joint settlement agreement proposed by Yankee Gas and other Connecticut natural gas distribution companies and regulatory agencies that clarified the procedures and oversight criteria applicable to the Expansion Plan. Yankee Gas received approval from PURA for its 2014 through 2019 System Expansion Reconciliations. The Company intends to file its 2020 System Expansion Reconciliation in March 2021 as required by PURA.\nSources and Availability of Natural Gas Supply\nNSTAR Gas maintains a flexible resource portfolio consisting of natural gas supply contracts, transportation contracts on interstate pipelines, market area storage and peaking services. NSTAR Gas purchases transportation, storage, and balancing services from Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company and Algonquin Gas Transmission Company, as well as other upstream pipelines that transport natural gas from major natural gas producing regions in the U.S., including the Gulf Coast, Mid-continent region, and Appalachian Shale supplies to the final delivery points in the NSTAR Gas service area. NSTAR Gas purchases all of its natural gas supply under a firm, competitively bid annual portfolio management contract. In addition to the firm transportation and natural gas storage supplies discussed above, NSTAR Gas utilizes on-system LNG facilities to meet its winter peaking demands. These LNG facilities are located within NSTAR Gas' distribution system and are used to liquefy and store pipeline natural gas during the warmer months for vaporization and use during the heating season. During the summer injection season, excess pipeline capacity and supplies are used to deliver and store natural gas in market area underground storage facilities located in Maryland and Pennsylvania. Stored natural gas is withdrawn during the winter season to supplement flowing pipeline supplies in order to meet firm heating demand. NSTAR Gas has firm underground storage contracts and total storage capacity entitlements of approximately 6.6 Bcf, of which 3.5 Bcf LNG storage is provided by Hopkinton LNG Corp. in facilities located in two different locations in Massachusetts.\nEGMA maintains a flexible resource portfolio consisting of natural gas supply contracts, transportation contracts on interstate pipelines, market area storage and peaking services. EGMA purchases transportation, storage, and balancing services from Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company and Algonquin Gas Transmission Company, as well as other upstream pipelines that transport natural gas from major natural gas producing regions in the U.S. as well as Canada, including the Gulf Coast, Mid-continent region, Appalachian Shale, and Dawn, Ontario supplies to the final delivery points in the EGMA service area. EGMA purchases the majority of its natural gas supply under a number of firm, competitively bid annual portfolio management contracts and manages a portion of its portfolio itself. In addition to the firm transportation and natural gas storage supplies discussed above, EGMA utilizes on-system LNG and LPG facilities to meet its winter peaking demands. These LNG and LPG facilities are located within EGMA\u2019s distribution system and are used to liquefy pipeline natural gas and/or receive liquefied natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas to be stored during the warmer months for vaporization and use during the heating season. During the summer injection season, excess pipeline capacity and supplies are used to deliver and store natural gas in market area underground storage facilities located in Maryland and Pennsylvania. Stored natural gas is withdrawn during the winter season to supplement flowing pipeline supplies in order to meet firm heating demand. EGMA has firm underground storage contracts and total storage capacity entitlements of approximately 6.6 Bcf, and 2.0 Bcf LNG and LPG storage located at eight different locations in Massachusetts.\nThe PURA requires Yankee Gas to meet the needs of its firm customers under all weather conditions. Specifically, Yankee Gas must structure its supply portfolio to meet firm customer needs under a design day scenario (defined as the coldest day in 30 years) and under a design year scenario (defined as the average of the four coldest years in the last 30 years). Yankee Gas also maintains a flexible resource portfolio consisting of natural gas supply contracts, transportation contracts on interstate pipelines, off-system storage and its on-system 1.2 Bcf LNG storage facility in Connecticut to meet consumption needs during the coldest days of winter. Yankee Gas obtains its interstate capacity from the three interstate pipelines that directly serve Connecticut: the Algonquin, Tennessee and Iroquois Pipelines, which connect to other upstream pipelines that transport natural gas from major natural gas producing regions, including the Gulf Coast, Mid-continent, Canadian regions and Appalachian Shale supplies.\nBased on information currently available regarding projected growth in demand and estimates of availability of future supplies of pipeline natural gas, each of NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas believes that in order to meet the long-term firm customer requirements in a reliable manner will necessitate a combination of pipeline, storage, and non-pipeline solutions.\nWATER DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT\nEversource Water Ventures, Inc., a Connecticut corporation, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eversource Aquarion Holdings, Inc. (Aquarion), operates three separate regulated water utilities in Connecticut (Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut, or AWC-CT), Massachusetts (Aquarion Water Company of Massachusetts, or AWC-MA) and New Hampshire (Aquarion Water Company of New Hampshire, or AWC-NH). These regulated companies provide water services to approximately 216,000 residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and fire protection and other customers, in 57 towns and cities in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 93 percent of Aquarion\u2019s customers were based in Connecticut.\nRates\nAquarion's water utilities are subject to regulation by the PURA, the DPU and the NHPUC in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, respectively. These regulatory agencies have jurisdiction over, among other things, rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.\nAquarion\u2019s general rate structure consists of various rate and service classifications covering residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal and fire protection services.\nThe rates established by the PURA, DPU and NHPUC are comprised of the following:\n\u2022A base rate, which is comprised of fixed charges based on meter/fire connection sizes, as well as volumetric charges based on the amount of water sold. Together these charges are designed to recover the full cost of service resulting from a general rate proceeding.\n\u2022In Connecticut, a revenue adjustment mechanism (RAM) that reconciles earned revenues, with certain allowed adjustments, on an annual basis, to the revenue requirement approved by the PURA in AWC-CT\u2019s last rate case (2013), which is an annual amount of $178.0 million.\n\u2022In Connecticut and New Hampshire, a water infrastructure conservation adjustment (WICA) charge, and in Massachusetts, an annual main replacement adjustment mechanism (MRAM) charge, which is applied between rate case proceedings and seeks recovery of allowed costs associated with eligible infrastructure improvement projects placed in-service. The WICA is updated semi-annually in Connecticut and annually in New Hampshire. In Connecticut, an annual WICA reconciliation mechanism reconciles earned WICA revenue to the approved WICA revenue with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n\u2022In Massachusetts, treatment plant surcharges, which are a series of three surcharges (one fixed and two volumetric in nature) that are designed to recover certain operating costs and the costs of the lease of the treatment plant located in Hingham. These surcharges were applicable only to customers in Hingham, Hull and Cohasset. On July 31, 2020, we sold our water system and treatment plant that supplies water to the towns of Hingham, Hull and North Cohasset to the town of Hingham, Massachusetts. For further information, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Massachusetts - Sale of Water System\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nSources and Availability of Water Supply\nOur water utilities obtain their water supplies from owned surface water sources (reservoirs) and groundwater supplies (wells) with a total supply yield of approximately 118 million gallons per day, as well as water purchased from other water suppliers. Approximately 99 percent of our annual production is self-supplied and processed at nine surface water treatment plants and numerous well stations, which are all located in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.\nThe capacities of Aquarion\u2019s sources of supply, and water treatment, pumping and distribution facilities, are considered sufficient to meet the present requirements of Aquarion\u2019s customers under normal conditions. On occasion, drought declarations are issued for portions of Aquarion\u2019s service territories in response to extended periods of dry weather conditions.\nOFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS\nEversource's offshore wind business includes ownership interests in North East Offshore and Bay State Wind, which together hold power purchase agreements (PPAs) and contracts for the Revolution Wind, South Fork Wind and Sunrise Wind projects, as well as offshore leases through BOEM. Our offshore wind projects are being developed and constructed through a joint and equal partnership with \u00d8rsted. This partnership also participates in new procurement opportunities for offshore wind energy in the Northeast U.S.\nEversource has a 50 percent ownership interest in North East Offshore, which holds the Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind projects, as well as a 257 square-mile ocean lease off the coasts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Eversource also has a 50 percent ownership interest in Bay State Wind, which holds the Sunrise Wind project. Bay State Wind's separate 300-square-mile ocean lease is located approximately 25 miles south of the coast of Massachusetts adjacent to the North East Offshore area. In aggregate, the Bay State Wind and the North East Offshore ocean lease sites jointly-owned by Eversource and \u00d8rsted could eventually develop at least 4,000 MW of clean, renewable offshore wind energy.\nRevolution Wind is a 704 MW offshore wind power project located approximately 15 miles south of the Rhode Island coast, and South Fork Wind is a 130 MW offshore wind power project located approximately 35 miles east of Long Island. Sunrise Wind is an 880 MW offshore wind facility, which will be developed 35 miles east of Montauk Point, Long Island. The completion dates for these projects are subject to federal permitting through BOEM, and engineering, state siting and permitting in New York and Rhode Island. For more information on these projects, see \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures - Offshore Wind Business\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nPROJECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nWe project to make capital expenditures of $17.03 billion from 2021 through 2025, of which we expect $10.90 billion to be in our electric and natural gas distribution segments, $4.31 billion to be in our electric transmission segment and $0.78 billion to be in our water distribution segment. We also project to invest $1.05 billion in information technology and facilities upgrades and enhancements. These projections do not include any expected investments related to our offshore wind partnership.\nFINANCING\nOur credit facilities and indentures require that Eversource parent and certain of its subsidiaries, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, NSTAR Gas, EGMA, Yankee Gas, and Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut, comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants as are customarily included in such agreements, including maintaining a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization of no more than 65 percent. All of these companies currently are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $1.02 billion of Eversource's long-term debt, including $450.0 million, $250.0 million, $282.0 million, and $40.2 million for Eversource parent, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, and Aquarion, respectively, will mature within the next 12 months.\nNUCLEAR FUEL STORAGE\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, and several other New England electric utilities are stockholders in three inactive regional nuclear generation companies, CYAPC, MYAPC and YAEC (collectively, the Yankee Companies). The Yankee Companies have completed the physical decommissioning of their respective nuclear power facilities and are now engaged in the long-term storage of their spent nuclear fuel. The Yankee Companies fund these costs through litigation proceeds received from the DOE and, to the extent necessary, through wholesale, FERC-approved rates charged under power purchase agreements with several New England utilities, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH. CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, in turn recover these costs from their customers through state regulatory commission-approved retail rates. The Yankee Companies collect amounts that we believe are adequate to recover the remaining plant closure and fuel storage cost estimates for the respective plants. We believe CL&P and NSTAR Electric will recover their shares of these obligations from their customers. PSNH has recovered its total share of these costs from its customers.\nWe consolidate the assets and obligations of CYAPC and YAEC on our consolidated balance sheet because our ownership and voting interests are greater than 50 percent of each of these companies.\nOTHER REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nGeneral\nWe are regulated by various federal and state agencies, including FERC, the SEC, and various state and/or local regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the industry and the service areas in which each of our companies operates, including the PURA, which has jurisdiction over CL&P, Yankee Gas, and Aquarion, the DPU, which has jurisdiction over NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Aquarion, and the NHPUC, which has jurisdiction over PSNH and Aquarion.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local requirements with respect to water quality, air quality, toxic substances, hazardous waste and other environmental matters. Additionally, major generation and transmission facilities may not be constructed or significantly modified without a review of the environmental impact of the proposed construction or modification by the applicable federal or state agencies.\nRenewable Portfolio Standards\nEach of the states in which we do business also has Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) requirements, which generally require fixed percentages of our energy supply to come from renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydropower, landfill gas, fuel cells and other similar sources.\nConnecticut's RPS statute requires increasing percentages of the electricity sold to retail customers to have direct ties to renewable sources. In 2020, the total RPS obligation was 29 percent and will ultimately reach 48 percent in 2030. CL&P is permitted to recover any costs incurred in complying with RPS from its customers through its GSC rate.\nMassachusetts' RPS program requires electricity suppliers to meet renewable energy standards. For 2020, the requirement was 27.71 percent, and will ultimately reach 39.31 percent in 2025. NSTAR Electric is permitted to recover any costs incurred in complying with RPS from its customers through rates. NSTAR Electric also owns renewable solar power facilities. The RECs generated from NSTAR Electric's solar power facilities are sold to other energy suppliers, and the proceeds from these sales are credited back to customers.\nNew Hampshire's RPS provision requires increasing percentages of the electricity sold to retail customers to have direct ties to renewable sources. In 2020, the total RPS obligation was 21.7 percent and it will ultimately reach 25.2 percent in 2025. The costs of the RECs are recovered by PSNH through rates charged to customers.\nHazardous Materials Regulations\nWe have recorded a liability for what we believe, based upon currently available information, is our reasonably estimable environmental investigation, remediation, and/or Natural Resource Damages costs for waste disposal sites for which we have probable liability. Under federal and state law, government agencies and private parties can attempt to impose liability on us for recovery of investigation and remediation costs at hazardous waste sites. As of December 31, 2020, the liability recorded for our reasonably estimable and probable environmental remediation costs for known sites needing investigation and/or remediation, exclusive of recoveries from insurance or from third parties, was $102.4 million, representing 63 sites. These costs could be significantly higher if additional remediation becomes necessary or when additional information as to the extent of contamination becomes available.\nThe most significant liabilities currently relate to future clean-up costs at former MGP facilities. These facilities were owned and operated by our predecessor companies from the mid-1800's to mid-1900's. By-products from the manufacture of natural gas using coal resulted in fuel oils, hydrocarbons, coal tar, purifier wastes, metals and other waste products that may pose a potential risk to human health and the environment. We currently have partial or full ownership responsibilities at former MGP sites that have a reserve balance of $92.2 million of the total $102.4 million as of December 31, 2020. MGP costs are recoverable through rates charged to our customers.\nElectric and Magnetic Fields\nFor more than twenty years, published reports have discussed the possibility of adverse health effects from electric and magnetic fields (EMF) associated with electric transmission and distribution facilities and appliances and wiring in buildings and homes. Although weak health risk associations reported in some epidemiology studies remain unexplained, most researchers, as well as numerous scientific review panels, considering all significant EMF epidemiology and laboratory studies, have concluded that the available body of scientific information does not support the conclusion that EMF affects human health.\nIn accordance with recommendations of various regulatory bodies and public health organizations, we reduce EMF associated with new transmission lines by the use of designs that can be implemented without additional cost or at a modest cost. We do not believe that other capital expenditures are appropriate to minimize unsubstantiated risks.\nGlobal Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emission Issues\nGlobal climate change and greenhouse gas emission issues have received an increased focus from state governments and the federal government. The EPA initiated a rulemaking addressing greenhouse gas emissions and, in 2009, issued a finding that concluded that greenhouse gas emissions are \"air pollution\" that endangers public health and welfare and should be regulated. The EPA has mandated greenhouse gas emission reporting beginning in 2011 for emissions for certain aspects of our business including volume of gas supplied to large customers and fugitive emissions of SF6 gas and methane.\nWe are continually evaluating the regulatory risks and regulatory uncertainty presented by climate change concerns. Such concerns could potentially lead to additional rules and regulations that impact how we operate our general utility business. These could include federal \"cap and trade\" laws, carbon taxes, and fuel and energy taxes. We expect that any costs of these rules and regulations would be recovered from customers.\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nFor information about Eversource Energy's executive officers, see Item 10, Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nEversource is committed to delivering reliable energy and superior customer service; expanding energy options for our region; environmental stewardship; a safe, diverse and fairly-compensated workforce; and community service and leadership.

We build employee engagement through continuous communication, developing talent, fostering teamwork and creating a diverse, inclusive workplace.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Eversource Energy employed a total of 9,299 employees, excluding temporary employees, of which 1,381 were employed by CL&P, 1,611 were employed by NSTAR Electric, and 745 were employed by PSNH. In addition, 3,373 were employed by Eversource Service, Eversource's service company, that provides support services to all Eversource operating companies. Approximately 50 percent of our employees are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Utility Workers Union of America or The United Steelworkers, and are covered by 14 collective bargaining agreements.\nSafety. At Eversource, our commitment to \u201cSafety First and Always\u201d is a principle and a mindset present in every job and every task, whether in the field, office or at home. A priority at Eversource is continuous improvement and safety is at the forefront as we continue to build a strong safety culture, embrace new technologies, and learn with our industry and community partners to improve safety performance. We use metrics such as Eversource Corporate Days Away Restricted Time (DART) and Preventable Motor Vehicle events, among others, to monitor safety performance. Our DART safety performance was 0.7 in 2020, measured by days away, restricted or transferred per 100 workers.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented our company-wide pandemic plan, which resulted in no employees losing their jobs due to the pandemic, and significant changes put in place that were in the best interest of our employees, customers, and communities. This included having nearly half of our employees working remotely, while implementing additional significant safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. For our employees performing essential functions that are required onsite, such as field crews and system operations, we have taken significant safety measures, including establishing social distancing measures, the use of personal protective equipment, increasing facility sanitization efforts, and enabling critical operations to be shifted to different control center locations if necessary. We continue to prepare for the re-entry of our employees working remotely. The plan is informed by public health guidance with the safety of our employees and customers as our highest priority. We are in the early phase of our re-entry plan and have returned fewer than 100 remote employees to the workplace. We have had increased short duration return to work for critical business needs, such as storm response and essential training. State and federal guidelines, external conditions, and critical business priorities continue to inform the pace of our re-entry plan. Significant health and safety measures and pandemic protocols will remain in place, including social distancing requirements, the use of personal protective equipment, sanitization efforts and employee training, for all employees currently working onsite and specific plans have been developed for our eventual re-entry to the workplace.\nDiversity & Inclusion. Our commitment to Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) is critical to building a diverse, empowered and engaged team that delivers great service safely to our customers. A diverse workforce and inclusive culture contribute to our success and sustainability by driving innovation and creating trusted relationships with our employees, customers, suppliers and community partners. Our hiring practices emphasize diversity and we encourage employees to embrace different people, perspectives and experiences in our workplace and within our communities. Additionally, our leadership behaviors underscore the importance of creating inclusive teams, where employees\u2019 voices and contributions are essential to delivering superior customer service.\nEversource\u2019s executive leadership team promotes and supports D&I by building diverse, inclusive work teams with high engagement, growing a pipeline of diverse talent, leveraging multiple perspectives to improve customer service, using diverse suppliers, engaging with multicultural organizations in our communities and supporting the work of the D&I council and business resource groups. Eversource continues to work toward a diverse workforce with a focus on women and minorities in leadership and has D&I goals and initiatives for diversity in leadership promotions and new hires, diverse external hires, diverse candidate slate, key talent, workforce representation, community and suppliers. Eversource drives accountability for D&I progress throughout the company and executive compensation is linked to meeting our D&I goals. In 2020, 47.6 percent of new hires and promotions into leadership roles were women or people of color.\nEversource's Board of Trustees is committed to diversity and inclusion and receives regular monthly progress updates. The Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Trustees seek diversity in gender, ethnicity and personal background when considering Trustee candidates. Our Board of Trustees has been recognized as one of the most diverse in our industry.\nCompensation, Health and Wellness Benefits. We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide competitive compensation and comprehensive benefit packages, including healthcare, life insurance, long-term disability insurance, death benefits, retirement plans (defined benefit pension plans or 401k Plan), an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, employee assistance programs, and tuition assistance, among many others. Eversource also provides wellness programs and benefits to encourage employees and their families to adopt and maintain healthy lifestyle habits.\nTalent Development, Training Programs and Education Opportunities. Eversource supports and develops its employees through training and development programs that build and strengthen employees\u2019 leadership and skill set. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have pivoted, and are providing employees with a variety of virtual classroom training opportunities. Continuous professional development is important to support our employees\u2019 ongoing success. These professional development programs include leadership effectiveness programs designed to develop new and current supervisors; a talent management process to identify high potential and emerging talent and ensure their development; a rotational associate engineering program; educational and professional development opportunities for employees who are recent college graduates; tuition assistance program; and paid internships and co-ops.\nStrategic workforce plans are developed every year as part of the annual business planning process to identify long-range needs to ensure that we acquire, develop and retain diverse, capable talent. This includes leveraging educational partnerships in critical craft and technical areas and developing proactive sourcing strategies to attract experienced professionals in highly technical roles in engineering, electric and gas operations, and energy efficiency. As part of this process, we identify critical roles and develop succession plans to ensure we have a capable supply of talent for the future.\nOver 800 new Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts employees (formerly Columbia Gas of Massachusetts employees) were welcomed and successfully onboarded in 2020. All Columbia Gas of Massachusetts employees who wanted to continue employment with Eversource were offered jobs.\nCommunity & Social Impact. Eversource and our employees support many programs, agencies, and not-for-profit organizations that support economic and community development, the environment, and initiatives that address local, high-priority concerns and needs. Eversource provides donations and other support to community agencies, including significant volunteer hours of our employees.\nSee Item 11, Executive Compensation, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the \u201cOur People\u201d section of our 2019 Sustainability Report located on our website, for more detailed information regarding our human capital programs and initiatives.

    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the matters set forth under \"Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\" included immediately prior to Item 1, Business, above, we are subject to a variety of material risks. Our susceptibility to certain risks, including those discussed in detail below, could exacerbate other risks. These risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our risk profile.\nCybersecurity and Data Privacy Risks:\nCyberattacks, including acts of war or terrorism, targeted directly on or indirectly affecting our systems or the systems of third parties on which we rely, could severely impair operations, negatively impact our business, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and adversely affect our reputation.\nA successful cyberattack on the information technology systems that control our transmission, distribution, gas and water systems or other assets could impair or prevent us from managing these systems and facilities, operating our systems effectively, or properly managing our data, networks and programs. The breach of certain information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and to repair system damage or security breaches and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation.\nWe have instituted safeguards to protect our information technology systems and assets. We deployed substantial technologies to system and application security, encryption and other measures to protect our computer systems and infrastructure from unauthorized access or misuse. We also interface with numerous external entities to improve our cybersecurity situational awareness. The FERC, through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), requires certain safeguards to be implemented to deter cyberattacks. These safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyberattacks. We maintain cyber insurance to cover damages and defense costs related to breaches of networks or operational technology, but it may be insufficient to cover all losses.\nAny such cyberattacks could result in loss of service to customers and a significant decrease in revenues, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe unauthorized access to and the misappropriation of confidential and proprietary customer, employee, financial or system operating information could adversely affect our business operations and adversely impact our reputation.\nIn the regular course of business, we, and our third-party suppliers, maintain sensitive customer, employee, financial and system operating information. We are required by various federal and state laws to safeguard this information. Cyber intrusions, security breaches, theft or loss of this information by cybercrime or otherwise could lead to the release of critical operating information or confidential customer or employee information, which could adversely affect our business operations or adversely impact our reputation, and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation. We maintain cyber insurance to cover damages and defense costs arising from unauthorized disclosure of, or failure to protect, private information, as well as costs for notification to, or for credit monitoring of, customers, employees and other persons in the event of a breach of private information. This insurance covers amounts paid to avert, prevent or stop a network attack or the disclosure of personal information, and costs of a qualified forensics firm to determine the cause, source and extent of a network attack or to investigate, examine and analyze our network to find the cause, source and extent of a data breach, but it may be insufficient to cover all losses. While we have implemented measures designed to prevent network attacks and mitigate their effects should they occur, these measures may not be effective due to the continually evolving nature of efforts to access confidential information.\nPandemic Risks, including COVID-19 Related Risks:\nAs evidenced by the global pandemic of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), global pandemics result in widespread disruption to the overall economic market and outlook, which could cause various unfavorable impacts to our customers, vendors, employees, regulators, and operations and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe continue to respond to COVID-19 by taking steps to mitigate the potential risks to Eversource posed by its spread. We provide a critical service to our customers, which means it is paramount that we keep our employees who operate our businesses safe, and minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to COVID-19. We have updated and implemented our company-wide pandemic plan to address specific aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This plan guides our emergency response, business continuity, and the precautionary measures we are taking on behalf of employees and our customers.\n\u2022Cybersecurity attacks: We, as well as others in the power and utility industry, have continued to experience significant events where outside parties, utilizing sophisticated methods, have attempted to compromise both our vendors and employees to try to gain access to our email systems, as well as attempting to access our other systems or networks. Eversource was not affected by the SolarWinds event. We continue to implement strong cybersecurity measures and have increased the education of our employees and contractors to ensure that our systems remain functional in order to both serve our operational needs with a remote workforce and to ensure uninterrupted service to our customers. Our incident response team works with compromised vendors to assist them in improving their security posture. We also continuously review and update our response plans to include responding to an event while in a remote work environment.\n\u2022Access to, or cost of, capital resources: We utilize the commercial paper market extensively for our short-term borrowing needs. At the onset of the pandemic in the United States, liquidity in the commercial paper credit market began to deteriorate rapidly. However, federal legislative actions, including actions taken by the Federal Reserve, have provided sufficient liquidity and stabilization of the credit markets. We continue to monitor the ability for us to access the global capital and credit markets; however, if we are unable to access these markets, then our financial condition may be adversely affected. We have had open, full access to the capital markets throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022Actions of regulators: We continue to work closely with our state regulatory commissions and consumer advocates on customer assistance measures, including payment plan options in order to mitigate the impact on customer rates in the future, as well as financial hardship and arrearage management programs for those customers who are unable to pay their utility bills. We developed these long-term solutions for customers in order to help minimize the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on customer receivable balances and customers\u2019 affordability in light of the current financial impact they may experience. We believe that we have in place, or are developing, successful mechanisms with our state regulatory commissions to recover our incremental costs associated with COVID-19, while balancing the impact on our customers\u2019 bills and our operating cash flows, however our financial condition may be adversely affected depending on the outcome of planned proceedings before our state regulatory commissions.\n\u2022Timing of strategic development opportunities: The successful execution of our timeline for developing our offshore wind projects is based on several factors, including state and federal siting and permitting approvals. We implemented, and continue to update, mitigation plans that addressed permitting delays due to COVID-19 work restrictions between March and June 2020 that resulted in a moderate impact to our offshore wind projects siting and permit filing timelines. However, we are unable to assess the potential impact that a reintroduction of work restrictions in response to a future resurgence in COVID-19 infections would have on our projects\u2019 timelines.\n\u2022Suppliers and Vendors: We have instituted measures to ensure our supply chain remains open to us; however, there could be global shortages that will impact our maintenance, capital programs, and storm response that we currently cannot anticipate.\n\u2022Loss of key personnel: We continue to adjust our pandemic plan to address various scenarios including reduced workforce levels and limited mutual aid in the event of a significant storm event. We have implemented remote work arrangements for our workforce by enabling nearly half of our employees to work from home and taking extra precautions for our field-based employees. We have taken significant safety measures to ensure adequate social distancing for our field crews to safely provide essential services to our customers. We have also adopted protocols to ensure the safety and health of those employees who work onsite in critical facilities. We continue to monitor COVID-19 developments affecting our workforce and will take additional precautions that we determine are necessary in order to mitigate the impacts. Although to date our workforce continues to be able to safely and reliably deliver our critical services to customers, we are unable to predict the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our employees.\nThe extent of the impact to us in the future will vary and depend in large part on the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic and the timing and extent of COVID-19 relief legislation, and the resulting impact on economic, health care and capital market conditions. The future impact will also depend on the outcome of planned proceedings before our state regulatory commissions to recover our incremental costs associated with COVID-19, which include uncollectible customer receivable expenses. As a result, we are currently unable to estimate the potential impact of COVID-19 to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nBusiness Risks:\nStrategic development opportunities associated with offshore wind or investment opportunities in electric transmission or clean-energy opportunities may not be successful, and projects may not commence operation as scheduled or be completed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects.\nWe are pursuing broader strategic development investment opportunities that will benefit the Northeast region related to the construction of offshore wind electric generation facilities, and investment opportunities in electric transmission facilities and other clean-energy infrastructure. The development of these activities involves numerous significant risks around schedule, cost, capacity factors, tax strategies and permitting (both on and offshore). Various external factors could result in increased costs or result in delays or cancellation of these projects. Risks include federal, state and local regulatory approval processes, new legislation impacting the industry, changes to federal income tax laws, economic events or factors, environmental and community concerns, design and siting issues, difficulties in obtaining required rights of way, competition from incumbent utilities and other entities, and actions of our strategic partners. Should any of these factors result in significant delays or cancellations, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected, or our future growth opportunities may not be realized as anticipated.\nEversource has a joint and equal partnership with \u00d8rsted for the development and operation of three offshore wind projects. Offshore wind is currently an emerging industry in the U.S., but it has a very robust operational and construction history in Europe. As such, siting, permitting, tax legislation, and supply chain are currently being addressed for the first time in the U.S. The projects currently being developed by our partnership may not achieve the results we anticipate. The partnership\u2019s ability to generate revenue from offshore wind projects depends on meeting our construction schedules, controlling cost overruns, maintaining continuing interconnection arrangements, power purchase agreements, or other market mechanisms as well as interconnecting utility and Regional Transmission Organizations rules, policies, procedures and FERC tariffs that permit future offshore wind project operations. After projects are placed in operation, capacity factors will directly affect revenues generated from these investments. Other factors that may have an adverse impact on our anticipated project returns include significant schedule delays resulting from federal, state or local permitting processes. Specifically, the approval from the BOEM is a critical path item in the projects' timeline. Any changes to tax laws or to Eversource\u2019s ability to monetize tax attributes associated with these projects could also have a material adverse effect on cash flows and project returns.\nAs a result of legislative and regulatory changes, the states in which we provide service have implemented new selection procedures for new major electric transmission, offshore wind and other clean energy facilities. These procedures require the review of competing projects and permit the selection of only those projects that are expected to provide the greatest benefit to customers. If the projects in which we have invested are not selected for construction, or even if our projects are selected, then legislative or regulatory actions could result in our projects not being probable of entering the construction phase, which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe outsource certain business functions to third-party suppliers and service providers, and substandard performance by those third parties could harm our business, reputation and results of operations.\nWe outsource certain services to third parties in areas including information technology, transaction processing, human resources, payroll and payroll processing and certain operational areas. As a result of our acquisition of the Columbia Gas of Massachusetts (CMA) assets from NiSource on October 9, 2020, we have entered into a Transition Services Agreement with NiSource whereby NiSource is performing certain services on behalf of our newly formed Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts in the areas of information technology, transaction processing, human resources, payroll and payroll processing and certain operational areas for periods ranging from 1 to 24 months. Outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to substandard quality of service delivery or substandard deliverables, which may result in missed deadlines or other timeliness issues, non-compliance (including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards) or reputational harm, which could negatively impact our results of operations. We also continue to pursue enhancements to standardize our systems and processes. If any difficulties in the operation of these systems were to occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations, or adversely affect our ability to work with regulators, unions, customers or employees.\nOur transmission and distribution systems may not operate as expected, and could require unplanned expenditures, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to properly operate our transmission and distribution systems is critical to the financial performance of our business. Our transmission and distribution businesses face several operational risks, including the breakdown, failure of, or damage to operating equipment, information technology systems, or processes, especially due to age; labor disputes; disruptions in the delivery of electricity, natural gas and water; increased capital expenditure requirements, including those due to environmental regulation; catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, a solar event, an electromagnetic event, or other similar occurrences; extreme weather conditions beyond equipment and plant design capacity; human error; and potential claims for property damage or personal injuries beyond the scope of our insurance coverage. Many of our transmission projects are expected to alleviate identified reliability issues and reduce customers' costs. However, if the in-service date for one or more of these projects is delayed due to economic events or factors, or regulatory or other delays, the risk of failures in the electric transmission system may increase. Any failure of our transmission and distribution systems to operate as planned may result in increased capital costs, reduced earnings or unplanned increases in operation and maintenance costs. The inability to recover a significant amount of such costs could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nNew technology and alternative energy sources could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nAdvances in technology that reduce the costs of alternative methods of producing electric energy to a level that is competitive with that of current electric production methods, could result in loss of market share and customers, and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive. These changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize energy, which could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses. Economic downturns or periods of high energy supply costs typically can lead to the development of legislative and regulatory policy designed to promote reductions in energy consumption and increased energy efficiency and self-generation by customers.\nThe loss of key personnel, the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, or the failure to maintain a positive relationship with our workforce could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nOur operations depend on the continued efforts of our employees. Retaining key employees and maintaining the ability to attract new employees are important to both our operational and financial performance. We cannot guarantee that any member of our management or any key employee at the Eversource parent or subsidiary level will continue to serve in any capacity for any particular period of time. In addition, a significant portion of our workforce in our subsidiaries, including many workers with specialized skills maintaining and servicing the electric, natural gas and water infrastructure, will be eligible to retire over the next five to ten years. Such highly skilled individuals cannot be quickly replaced due to the technically complex work they perform. We have developed strategic workforce plans to identify key functions and proactively implement plans to assure a ready and qualified workforce, but we cannot predict the impact of these plans on our ability to hire and retain key employees. Labor disputes, work stoppages or an inability to negotiate future collective bargaining agreements on commercially reasonable terms, as well as the intentional misconduct of employees or contractors, may also have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Environment and Catastrophic Events:\nThe effects of climate change, including severe storms, could cause significant damage to any of our facilities requiring extensive expenditures, the recovery for which is subject to approval by regulators.\nClimate change creates physical and financial risks to our operations. Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea levels and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events including drought. Customers\u2019 energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity. For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use. For water customers, conservation measures imposed by the communities we serve could impact water usage. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers\u2019 energy and water usage could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes.\nSevere weather, such as ice and snow storms, hurricanes, droughts, and other natural disasters, may cause outages and property damage, which may require us to incur additional costs that may not be recoverable from customers. The cost of repairing damage to our operating subsidiaries' facilities and the potential disruption of their operations due to storms, natural disasters or other catastrophic events could be substantial, particularly as regulators and customers demand better and quicker response times to outages. If, upon review, any of our state regulatory authorities finds that our actions were imprudent, some of those restoration costs may not be recoverable from customers. The inability to recover a significant amount of such costs could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We maintain property insurance, but it may be insufficient to cover all losses.\nContamination of our water supplies, the failure of dams on reservoirs providing water to our customers, or requirements to repair, upgrade or dismantle any of these dams, may disrupt our ability to distribute water to our customers and result in substantial additional costs, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur water supplies, including water provided to our customers, are subject to possible contamination from naturally occurring compounds or man-made substances.\nOur water systems include impounding dams and reservoirs of various sizes. Although we believe our dams are structurally sound and well-maintained, significant damage to these facilities, or a significant decrease in the water in our reservoirs, could adversely affect our ability to provide water to our customers until the facilities and a sufficient amount of water in our reservoirs can be restored. A failure of a dam could result in personal injuries and downstream property damage for which we may be liable. The failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers. Any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams may not be recoverable in rates and may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We maintain liability insurance, but it may be insufficient to cover all losses.\nPhysical attacks, including acts of war or terrorism, both threatened and actual, could adversely affect our ability to operate our systems and could adversely affect our financial results and liquidity.\nPhysical attacks, including acts of war or terrorism, both threatened and actual, that damage our transmission and distribution systems or other assets could negatively impact our ability to transmit or distribute energy, water, natural gas, or operate our systems efficiently or at all. Because our electric transmission systems are part of an interconnected regional grid, we face the risk of widespread blackouts due to grid disturbances or disruptions on a neighboring interconnected system. Similarly, our natural gas distribution system is connected to transmission pipelines, not owned by Eversource. If there was an attack on the transmission pipelines, it could impact our ability to deliver natural gas. If our assets were physically damaged and were not recovered in a timely manner, it could result in a loss of service to customers, a significant decrease in revenues, significant expense to repair system damage, costs associated with governmental actions in response to such attacks, and liability claims, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We maintain property and liability insurance, but it may be insufficient to cover all losses.\nRegulatory, Legislative and Compliance Risks:\nThe actions of regulators and legislators could significantly impact our ability to recover costs in a timely manner and can affect our earnings and liquidity.\nThe rates that our electric, natural gas and water companies charge their customers are determined by their state regulatory commissions and by the FERC. These commissions also regulate the companies' accounting, operations, the issuance of certain securities and certain other matters. The FERC also regulates the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at wholesale, accounting, issuance of certain securities and certain other matters, including reliability standards through NERC.\nUnder state and federal law, our electric, natural gas and water companies are entitled to charge rates that are sufficient to allow them an opportunity to recover their prudently incurred operating and capital costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, to attract needed capital and maintain their financial integrity, while also protecting relevant public interests. Each of these companies prepares and submits periodic rate filings with their respective regulatory commissions for review and approval, which allows for various entities to challenge our current or future rates, structures or mechanisms and could alter or limit the rates we are allowed to charge our customers and may not match the timing of when costs are incurred. Additionally, catastrophic events at other utilities could result in our regulators and legislators imposing additional requirements that may lead to additional costs for the Company.\nThere is no assurance that regulators will approve the recovery of all costs incurred by our electric, natural gas and water companies, including costs for construction, operation and maintenance, as well as a reasonable return on their respective regulated assets. The amount of costs incurred by the companies, coupled with increases in fuel and energy prices, could lead to consumer or regulatory resistance to the timely recovery of such costs, thereby adversely affecting our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe FERC has jurisdiction over our transmission costs recovery and our allowed ROEs. Certain outside parties have filed four complaints against all electric companies under the jurisdiction of ISO-NE alleging that our allowed ROEs are unjust and unreasonable. An adverse decision in any of these four complaints could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFERC's policy has encouraged competition for transmission projects, even within existing service territories of electric companies. Implementation of FERC's goals, including within our service territories, may expose us to competition for construction of transmission projects, additional regulatory considerations, and potential delay with respect to future transmission projects, which may adversely affect our results of operations and lower rate base growth.\nChanges in tax laws, as well as the potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our business, results of operations (including our expected project returns from our planned offshore wind facilities), financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to significant reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to increased regulatory oversight or other sanctions.\nBecause utility companies, including our electric, natural gas and water utility subsidiaries, have large customer bases, they are subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of their distribution services and the speed with which they are able to respond to electric outages, natural gas leaks and similar interruptions caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events. Adverse publicity of this nature could harm our reputation and the reputation of our subsidiaries; may make state legislatures, utility commissions and other regulatory authorities less likely to view us in a favorable light; and may cause us to be subject to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight. Unfavorable regulatory outcomes can include more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations, such as reliability and customer service quality standards or vegetation management requirements, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements.\nCosts of compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including those related to climate change, may increase and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur subsidiaries' operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations that govern, among other things, water quality, water discharges, the management of hazardous and solid waste, and air emissions. Compliance with these requirements requires us to incur significant costs relating to environmental monitoring, maintenance and upgrading of facilities, remediation and permitting.\nThe costs of compliance with existing legal requirements or legal requirements not yet adopted may increase in the future. An increase in such costs, unless promptly recovered, could have an adverse impact on our business and our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFor further information, see Item 1, Business - Other Regulatory and Environmental Matters, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancial, Economic, and Market Risks:\nOur goodwill is recorded at an amount that, if impaired and written down, could adversely affect our future operating results and total capitalization.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet, which, as of December 31, 2020, totaled $4.4 billion. The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. We test our goodwill balances for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events occur, or circumstances change that would indicate a potential for impairment. A determination that goodwill is deemed to be impaired would result in a non-cash charge that could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and total capitalization. The annual goodwill impairment test in 2020 resulted in a conclusion that our goodwill was not impaired.\nOur counterparties may not meet their obligations to us or may elect to exercise their termination rights, which could adversely affect our earnings.\nWe are exposed to the risk that counterparties to various arrangements that owe us money, have contracted to supply us with energy or other commodities or services, or that work with us as strategic partners, including on significant capital projects, will not be able to perform their obligations, will terminate such arrangements or, with respect to our credit facilities, fail to honor their commitments. Should any of these counterparties fail to perform their obligations or terminate such arrangements, we might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at higher market prices and/or have to delay the completion of, or cancel, a capital project. Should any lenders under our credit facilities fail to perform, the level of borrowing capacity under those arrangements could decrease. In any such events, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nLimits on our access to, or increases in, the cost of capital may adversely impact our ability to execute our business plan.\nWe use short-term debt and the long-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity and funding for capital requirements not obtained from our operating cash flow. If access to these sources of liquidity becomes constrained, our ability to implement our business strategy could be adversely affected. In addition, higher interest rates would increase our cost of borrowing, which could adversely impact our results of operations. A downgrade of our credit ratings or events beyond our control, such as a disruption in global capital and credit markets, could increase our cost of borrowing and cost of capital or restrict our ability to access the capital markets and negatively affect our ability to maintain and to expand our businesses.\nMarket performance or changes in assumptions may require us to make significant contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nWe provide a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefits for a substantial number of employees, former employees and retirees. Our future pension obligations, costs and liabilities are highly dependent on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include estimated investment returns, interest rates, discount rates, health care cost trends, benefit changes, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. If our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs could increase significantly. In addition, various factors, including underperformance of plan investments and changes in law or regulation, could increase the amount of contributions required to fund our pension plan in the future. Additional large funding requirements, when combined with the financing requirements of our construction\nprogram, could impact the timing, amounts, and number of future financings and negatively affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a holding company with no revenue-generating operations, Eversource parent's liquidity is dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries, its commercial paper program, and its ability to access the long-term debt and equity capital markets.\nEversource parent is a holding company and as such, has no revenue-generating operations of its own. Its ability to meet its debt service obligations and to pay dividends on its common shares is largely dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay borrowings from, Eversource parent, and/or Eversource parent's ability to access its commercial paper program or the long-term debt and equity capital markets. Prior to funding Eversource parent, the subsidiary companies have financial obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, their operating expenses, debt service, preferred dividends of certain subsidiaries, and obligations to trade creditors. Should the subsidiary companies not be able to pay dividends or repay funds due to Eversource parent, or if Eversource parent cannot access its commercial paper programs or the long-term debt and equity capital markets, Eversource parent's ability to pay interest, dividends and its own debt obligations would be restricted.",

The earnings and EPS of each business discussed below do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities of such business but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole. EPS by business is a financial measure not recognized under GAAP, calculated by dividing the Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders of each business by the weighted average diluted Eversource common shares outstanding for the period. Our earnings discussion also includes non-GAAP financial measures referencing our 2020 earnings and EPS excluding certain acquisition costs related to our purchase of the assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and our 2019 earnings and EPS excluding the impairment charge for the NPT project.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results by business and to more fully compare and explain our 2020 and 2019 results without including these items. We believe the acquisition costs and the NPT impairment charge are not indicative of our ongoing costs and performance. Due to the nature and significance of these items on Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders, we believe that the non-GAAP presentation is a more meaningful representation of our financial performance and provides additional and useful information to readers of this report in analyzing historical and future performance of our business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to reported Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders or EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of operating performance.\nFinancial Condition and Business Analysis\nExecutive Summary\nThe following items in this executive summary are explained in more detail in this combined Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nEarnings Overview and Future Outlook:\n\u2022We earned $1.21 billion, or $3.55 per share, in 2020, compared with $909.1 million, or $2.81 per share, in 2019. Our 2020 results include after-tax acquisition costs related to our purchase of the assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts (CMA) of $32.1 million, or $0.09 per share. Excluding those acquisition costs, we earned $1.24 billion, or $3.64 per share, in 2020. Our 2019 results include an after-tax impairment charge of $204.4 million, or $0.64 per share, related to our former investment in the NPT project. Excluding the NPT impairment charge, we earned $1.11 billion, or $3.45 per share, in 2019.\n\u2022Our electric distribution segment earned $544.0 million, or $1.60 per share, in 2020, compared with $513.3 million, or $1.59 per share, in 2019. Our natural gas distribution segment earned $134.1 million, or $0.40 per share, in 2020, compared with $96.2 million, or $0.30 per share, in 2019. Our water distribution segment earned $41.2 million, or $0.12 per share, in 2020, compared with $34.9 million, or $0.11 per share, in 2019.\n\u2022Our electric transmission segment earned $502.5 million, or $1.48 per share, in 2020, compared with $256.5 million, or $0.79 per share, in 2019. Excluding the after-tax NPT impairment charge of $204.4 million, or $0.64 per share, our electric transmission segment earned $460.9 million, or $1.43 per share, in 2019.\n\u2022Eversource parent and other companies had a net loss of $16.6 million, or $0.05 per share, in 2020, compared with earnings of $8.2 million, or $0.02 per share, in 2019. Excluding acquisition costs, Eversource parent and other companies earned $14.0 million, or $0.04 per share, in 2020.\n\u2022We currently project 2021 non-GAAP earning guidance of between $3.81 per share and $3.93 per share, which excludes the impact of integration costs related to our purchase of the natural gas distribution assets of CMA. We also project that our long-term EPS growth rate through 2025 from our regulated utility businesses will be in the upper half of the 5 to 7 percent range.\n\u2022The outbreak of COVID-19 has not resulted in significant operational or earnings impacts. We believe that we have in place, or are developing, successful mechanisms with our state regulatory commissions that allow, or will allow, us to recover our incremental costs associated with COVID-19, which include uncollectible customer receivable expenses. We are continuing to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, and we continue to operate under our pandemic response plan.\nLiquidity:\n\u2022Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $1.68 billion in 2020, compared with $2.01 billion in 2019. Investments in property, plant and equipment totaled $2.94 billion in 2020 and $2.91 billion in 2019. Cash totaled $106.6 million as of December 31, 2020, compared with $15.4 million as of December 31, 2019. Our available borrowing capacity under our commercial paper programs totaled $1.40 billion as of December 31, 2020.\n\u2022In 2020, we issued 11,960,000 common shares, which resulted in proceeds of $929.0 million, net of issuance costs.\n\u2022In 2020, we issued $2.76 billion of new long-term debt, consisting of $1.55 billion by Eversource parent, $400 million by CL&P, $400 million by NSTAR Electric, $150 million by PSNH, $190 million by NSTAR Gas, and $70 million by Yankee Gas. Proceeds from these new issuances were used primarily to fund a portion of the purchase price for the CMA asset acquisition and to pay short-term borrowings at Eversource parent, refinance investments in eligible green expenditures at NSTAR Electric, and to refinance existing indebtedness, fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes at CL&P, PSNH, NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas.\n\u2022In 2020, we issued dividends totaling $2.27 per common share, compared with dividends of $2.14 per common share in 2019. On February 9, 2021, our Board of Trustees approved a common share dividend payment of $0.6025 per share, payable on March 31, 2021 to shareholders of record as of March 4, 2021. The 2021 dividend represents an increase of 6.2 percent over the dividend paid in December 2020.\n\u2022We project to make capital expenditures of $17.03 billion from 2021 through 2025, of which we expect $10.90 billion to be in our electric and natural gas distribution segments, $4.31 billion to be in our electric transmission segment and $0.78 billion to be in our water distribution segment. We also project to invest $1.05 billion in information technology and facilities upgrades and enhancements. These projections do not include any expected investments related to offshore wind projects.\nStrategic and Regulatory Items:\n\u2022On October 9, 2020, Eversource completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities that comprised NiSource\u2019s natural gas distribution business in Massachusetts, CMA, for a cash purchase price of $1.1 billion, plus a target working capital amount of $69.6 million, which is subject to adjustment to reflect actual working capital as of the closing date. On October 7, 2020, the DPU approved the rate plan related to the acquisition. The approved rate stabilization plan includes base distribution rate increases of $13 million on November 1, 2021 and $10 million on November 1, 2022. The settlement agreement includes two rate base resets during an eight-year rate plan, occurring on November 1, 2024 and November 1, 2027.\n\u2022On December 15, 2020, the NHPUC approved an October 9, 2020 settlement agreement that included a permanent rate increase of $45.0 million effective January 1, 2021 at PSNH. PSNH was also permitted three step increases, effective January 1, 2021, August 1, 2021, and August 1, 2022, to reflect plant additions in calendar years 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The settlement agreement allowed for the effect of the permanent rate increase to be extended back to the temporary rate period. In lieu of a customer rate increase for this recoupment of revenue, the NHPUC directed a portion of the total EDIT regulatory liability to offset bill impacts to customers.\n\u2022On October 30, 2020, the DPU approved an NSTAR Gas base distribution rate increase of $23.0 million effective November 1, 2020. NSTAR Gas' 2019 plant additions are allowed recovery beginning on November 1, 2021.\n\u2022In January 2021, BOEM released its Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the South Fork Wind project, which assessed the environmental, social, and economic impacts of constructing the project.\nImpact of COVID-19\nCOVID-19 has adversely affected workers and the economy and caused volatility in the financial markets. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the unprecedented and evolving situation, we continue to closely monitor how COVID-19 related developments affect Eversource. Based on available information, we have not experienced significant impacts directly related to the pandemic that have adversely affected our current operations or results of operations. The extent of the impact to us in the future will vary and depend in large part on the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic and the timing and extent of COVID-19 relief legislation, and the resulting impact on economic, health care and capital market conditions. The future impact will also depend on the outcome of planned proceedings before our state regulatory commissions to recover our incremental costs associated with COVID-19, which include uncollectible customer receivable expenses.\nOperational: We provide a critical service to our customers and have taken extensive measures to maintain its safety and reliability. We have implemented our company-wide pandemic plan, which guides our emergency response, business continuity, and the precautionary measures we are taking to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of our employees, our customers, and our communities. We continue to adjust our company-wide pandemic plan to address various scenarios, including reduced workforce levels and limited mutual aid in the event of a significant storm event, and have implemented protective measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our workforce. We have implemented work from home policies where appropriate, resulting in nearly half of our employees working remotely. For our employees performing essential functions that are required onsite, such as field crews and system operations, we have taken significant safety measures, including establishing social distancing measures, the use of personal protective equipment, increasing facility sanitization efforts, and enabling critical operations to be shifted to different control center locations if necessary. At this time, our workforce staffing levels continue to enable us to safely and reliably deliver our critical services to customers.\nWe continue to prepare for the re-entry of our employees working remotely. Our re-entry plan includes a multi-phase approach that is measured and gradual. The plan is informed by public health guidance with the safety of our employees and customers as our highest priority. We are in the early phase of our re-entry plan and have returned fewer than 100 remote employees to the workplace. We have had increased short duration return to work for critical business needs, such as storm response and essential training. State and federal guidelines, external conditions, and critical business priorities continue to inform the pace of our re-entry plan. Significant health and safety measures and pandemic protocols will remain in place, including social distancing requirements, the use of personal protective equipment, sanitization efforts and employee training, for all employees currently working onsite and specific plans have been developed for our eventual re-entry to the workplace.\nIn mid-March, we suspended non-critical work inside customer premises, which included energy audits inside our customers\u2019 homes and businesses. These activities resumed in early July with the implementation of new health and safety guidelines for the restart of energy efficiency services to customers. This delay did not have a significant impact on our 2020 spending levels or incentives earned. As of the date of our filing, we do not expect a significant impact on our 2021 energy efficiency program spending and efforts, which assumes the continuation of energy efficiency programs throughout 2021. Actual energy efficiency spending levels will depend on the extent and duration of the pandemic.\nAmong the states we serve, COVID-19 had initially spread in a rapid manner in Connecticut and Massachusetts during the outbreak that began in mid-March. During the summer, these states had seen a decrease in the infection rate and daily confirmed cases, as well as more capacity in hospitals, and improved testing availability and contact tracing, as compared to the initial outbreak. Beginning in October, the spread of COVID-19 began to increase at a significant pace, surpassing infection levels from the initial outbreak, peaking in December 2020 and January 2021 in each of the states we serve. Since those peak levels, there has been a downward trend in the daily confirmed cases, infection rates and positive test rates.\nFinancial: Overall, our future financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively impacted by COVID-19 as it relates to the collectability of customer receivables and customer payment plans, elimination of late payment revenues, lower sales volumes primarily from PSNH's commercial and industrial customers, energy efficiency spending levels and incentives earned, and increased expenses for cleaning and supplies for personal protective equipment. Other potential negative financial impacts relate to market volatility on our equity and debt securities, access to, as well as cost of, capital resources, and the ability of various third-party vendors and suppliers to fulfill their obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our allowance for uncollectible customer receivable balance of $358.9 million, of which $194.8 million relates to hardship accounts that are specifically recovered in rates charged to customers, adequately reflected the collection risk and net realizable value for our receivables. We continue to evaluate the adequacy of the uncollectible allowance based on an ongoing assessment of accounts receivable collections and customer payment trends, economic conditions, delinquency statistics, aging-based quantitative assessments, the impact on residential customer bills because of energy usage and change in rates, flexible payment plans and financial hardship arrearage management programs being offered to customers, and COVID-19 developments, including any potential federal governmental pandemic relief programs and the expansion of unemployment benefit initiatives, which help to mitigate the potential for increasing customer account delinquencies. Additionally, management considered past economic declines and corresponding uncollectible reserves as part of the current assessment. This evaluation has shown that our operating companies have experienced an increase in aged receivables and some lower cash collections from customers because of the moratorium on disconnections and the economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBased upon the evaluation performed, in 2020, we increased the allowance for uncollectible accounts for amounts incurred as a result of COVID-19 by $31.5 million for Eversource ($2.8 million for CL&P, $11.0 million for NSTAR Electric, $2.3 million for PSNH and $15.4 million at our natural gas businesses). These COVID-19 related uncollectible amounts were deferred either as incremental regulatory costs or deferred through existing regulatory tracking mechanisms that recover uncollectible energy supply costs, as we believe it is probable that these costs will ultimately be recovered from customers in rates. We believe that we have in place, or are developing, successful mechanisms with our state regulatory commissions that allow, or will allow, us to recover our incremental costs associated with COVID-19, which include uncollectible customer receivable expenses, while balancing the impact on our customers\u2019 bills and our operating cash flows.\nIn March 2020, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire each established moratoria on disconnections of residential and commercial customers for non-payment for utility service. In all three states, a moratorium for lower income hardship residential customers will remain in place through the normal state regulated winter moratorium that ends in the spring of 2021. In Connecticut and New Hampshire, the moratorium for all remaining customers has expired. In Massachusetts, the moratorium on commercial utility disconnections ended on September 1, 2020 and the moratorium on residential non-hardship disconnections was extended to April 1, 2021.\nWe continue to work closely with our state regulatory commissions and consumer advocates on customer assistance measures, including payment plan options in order to mitigate the impact on customer rates in the future, as well as financial hardship and arrearage management programs for those customers who are unable to pay their utility bills. We developed these long-term solutions for customers in order to help minimize the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on customer receivable balances and customers\u2019 affordability in light of the current financial impact they may experience. Our operating companies also eliminated late payment charges beginning in March 2020, with New Hampshire being the only state with a defined restart date of April 1, 2021. In 2020, we have waived $6.1 million of late payment charges that would have otherwise been recognized within revenues as a benefit to pre-tax earnings.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net incremental costs incurred as a result of COVID-19 totaled $35.2 million and related to uncollectible expense that impacts earnings, facilities and fleet cleaning, sanitizing costs and supplies for personal protective equipment, net of cost savings. We have deferred $24.0 million of these net incremental COVID-19 costs on the balance sheet, of which $15.8 million of that deferral related to uncollectible expense that impacts earnings and $8.2 million related to cleaning and supplies for personal protective equipment. Incremental COVID-19 expenses that reduced pre-tax earnings totaled $11.1 million on the statement of income. For further information on Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire COVID-19-related regulatory developments, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - COVID-19 Regulatory Dockets\" included in this Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis.\nAn extended economic slowdown has resulted in lower demand for electricity, natural gas and/or water by our commercial and industrial customers. However, fluctuations in retail sales volumes for CL&P, NSTAR Electric, Yankee Gas, NSTAR Gas, EGMA, and our Connecticut water distribution business do not materially impact earnings due to their respective state regulatory commission-approved distribution revenue decoupling mechanisms. Overall, our risk of exposure to lower demand and resulting lost sales revenues is limited as our regulated utilities are under cost-of-service rates with revenue decoupling mechanisms (with the exception of PSNH) and a significant portion of uncollectible expenses are tracked for ultimate recovery. Our revenue decoupling mechanisms allow us to recover an annual revenue stream that is decoupled from actual customer usage, and each is reconciled each year as part of our annual decoupling filing in each respective jurisdiction.\nWe continue to monitor Eversource parent\u2019s and our operating companies\u2019 ability to access the global capital and credit markets. At the onset of the pandemic in the United States, liquidity in the commercial paper credit market began to deteriorate rapidly. However, federal legislative actions, including actions taken by the Federal Reserve, have provided sufficient liquidity and stabilization of the credit markets. An extended economic slowdown could result in Eversource parent and our operating companies finding difficulty in accessing necessary capital resources and incurring higher costs for those capital resources. At this time, based on available information and the current market trends, we believe we will continue to have access to needed liquidity and capital resources to successfully execute our projected capital expenditures and strategies. We expect our existing borrowing availability under our commercial paper programs, our existing revolving credit facilities that serve to backstop those commercial paper programs, in addition to access to the debt and equity markets, will be sufficient to meet our future liquidity and capital resource needs.\nEarnings Overview\nConsolidated: Below is a summary of our earnings by business, which also reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of consolidated non-GAAP earnings and EPS, as well as EPS by business, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures of consolidated Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders and diluted EPS.\nRegulated Companies: Our regulated companies comprise the electric distribution, electric transmission, natural gas distribution and water distribution segments. A summary of our segment earnings and EPS is as follows:\n(1) These costs are associated with our acquisition and integration of the assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. Additional integration costs related primarily to the integration and transition of systems, are expected in 2021.\nOur electric distribution segment earnings increased $30.7 million in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to base distribution rate increases at CL&P effective May 1, 2020 and May 1, 2019, at NSTAR Electric effective January 1, 2020, and at PSNH effective July 1, 2019, higher earnings from CL&P's capital tracker mechanism due to increased electric system improvements, and the impact of the PSNH rate settlement agreement approved in December 2020. The earnings increase was partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense (primarily attributable to higher storm restoration costs), higher depreciation expense, higher property tax expense, higher interest expense, and the absence of the 2019 recognition of carrying charges on PSNH's 2013 through 2016 storm costs approved for recovery.\nOur electric transmission segment earnings increased $246.0 million in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the absence in 2020 of the 2019 impairment of NPT, which resulted in an after-tax charge of $204.4 million, or $0.64 per share. Excluding the NPT impairment charge, earnings increased $41.6 million in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to a higher transmission rate base as a result of our continued investment in our transmission infrastructure and a higher benefit from the annual billing and cost reconciliation filing with FERC.\nOur natural gas distribution segment earnings increased $37.9 million in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to base distribution rate increases at Yankee Gas effective January 1, 2020 and at NSTAR Gas effective November 1, 2020, the addition of Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts (EGMA), higher earnings from capital tracker mechanisms due to continued investments in natural gas infrastructure, and lower interest expense due to a property tax settlement. EGMA's natural gas distribution business earned $13.9 million from October 9, 2020 through December 31, 2020. The earnings increase was partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense.\nOur water distribution segment earnings increased $6.3 million in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to an after-tax gain of $3.5 million on the sale of the water system and treatment plant of the Hingham, Massachusetts business, higher revenues from our Connecticut business' capital tracker mechanism due to increased infrastructure improvements, and a gain on the sale of land, partially offset by higher property tax expense and a higher effective tax rate.\nEversource Parent and Other Companies: Eversource parent and other companies earnings decreased $24.8 million in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the costs of the CMA asset acquisition recorded at Eversource parent of $30.6 million in 2020. Excluding the CMA asset acquisition costs, earnings increased $5.8 million due primarily to a higher return at Eversource Service as a result of increased investments in property, plant and equipment, and lower employee-related costs, partially offset by lower unrealized gains associated with our equity method investment in a renewable energy fund.\nLiquidity\nCash totaled $106.6 million as of December 31, 2020, compared with $15.4 million as of December 31, 2019.\nShort-Term Debt - Commercial Paper Programs and Credit Agreements: Eversource parent has a $2.00 billion commercial paper program allowing Eversource parent to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt. Eversource parent, CL&P, PSNH, NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas and Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut are parties to a five-year $1.45 billion revolving credit facility, which terminates on December 6, 2024. On October 21, 2020, Eversource parent and EGMA entered into a short-term $550 million revolving credit facility, which terminates on October 20, 2021. These revolving credit facilities serve to backstop Eversource parent's $2.00 billion commercial paper program.\nNSTAR Electric has a $650 million commercial paper program allowing NSTAR Electric to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt. NSTAR Electric is also a party to a five-year $650 million revolving credit facility, which terminates on December 6, 2024. The revolving credit facility serves to backstop NSTAR Electric's $650 million commercial paper program.\nThe amount of borrowings outstanding and available under the commercial paper programs were as follows:\nThere were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nOn May 15, 2020, CL&P and PSNH entered into uncommitted line of credit agreements, which will expire by May 14, 2021. The CL&P agreements total $450 million and the PSNH agreements total $300 million. There are no borrowings outstanding on either the CL&P or PSNH uncommitted line of credit agreements as of December 31, 2020.\nAmounts outstanding under the commercial paper programs are included in Notes Payable and classified in current liabilities on the Eversource and NSTAR Electric balance sheets, as all borrowings are outstanding for no more than 364 days at one time.\nIntercompany Borrowings: Eversource parent uses its available capital resources to provide loans to its subsidiaries to assist in meeting their short-term borrowing needs. Eversource parent records intercompany interest income from its loans to subsidiaries, which is eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany loans from Eversource parent to its subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation on Eversource's balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020, there were intercompany loans from Eversource parent to PSNH of $46.3 million, and to a subsidiary of NSTAR Electric of $21.3 million. As of December 31, 2019, there were intercompany loans from Eversource parent to CL&P of $63.8 million, to PSNH of $27.0 million, and to a subsidiary of NSTAR Electric of $30.3 million. Intercompany loans from Eversource parent are included in Notes Payable to Eversource Parent and classified in current liabilities on the respective subsidiary's balance sheets.\nLong-Term Debt Issuance Authorizations: On January 27, 2020, the DPU approved NSTAR Gas' request for authorization to issue up to $270 million in long-term debt through December 31, 2021. On July 31, 2020, the NHPUC approved PSNH's request for authorization to issue up to $200 million in long-term debt through December 31, 2020. On December 14, 2020, NSTAR Electric filed a petition with the DPU for authorization to issue $1.6 billion in long-term debt through December 31, 2023. On December 16, 2020, Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut filed an application with PURA for authorization to issue $100 million in long-term debt through December 31, 2021.\nLong-Term Debt Issuances and Repayments: The following table summarizes long-term debt issuances and repayments:\n(1) These senior notes are part of the same series issued by Eversource parent in January 2020. The aggregate outstanding principal amount of these senior notes is now $650 million.\n(2) The proceeds from these Eversource parent issuances funded a portion of the purchase price for the CMA asset acquisition and refinanced short-term borrowings.\nIn January 2021, PSNH provided a redemption notice to the holders of the PSNH 4.050% Series Q First Mortgage Bonds that PSNH will redeem the $122 million of bonds on March 1, 2021, the par call date, in advance of the June 1, 2021 maturity date.\nRate Reduction Bonds: PSNH's RRB payments consist of principal and interest and are paid semi-annually. PSNH paid $43.2 million of RRB principal payments and $20.2 million of interest payments in 2020, and $52.3 million of RRB principal payments and $26.8 million of interest payments in 2019.\nCommon Share Issuances and 2019 Forward Sale Agreement: On June 15, 2020, Eversource completed an equity offering of 6,000,000 common shares at a price per share of $86.26. Eversource used the net proceeds of this offering to fund a portion of the purchase of the assets of CMA that closed on October 9, 2020. The issuance of these common shares resulted in proceeds of $509.2 million, net of issuance costs.\nIn June 2019, Eversource completed an equity offering consisting of 5,980,000 common shares issued directly by the Company and 11,960,000 common shares issuable pursuant to a forward sale agreement with an investment bank. Under the forward sale agreement, 11,960,000 common shares were borrowed from third parties and sold by the underwriters. The forward sale agreement allowed Eversource, at its election and prior to May 29, 2020, to physically settle the forward sale agreement by issuing common shares in exchange for net proceeds at the then-applicable forward sale price specified by the agreement (initially, $71.48 per share) or, alternatively, to settle the forward sale agreement in whole or in part through the delivery or receipt of shares or cash. The forward sale price was subject to adjustment daily based on a floating interest rate factor and would decrease in respect of certain fixed amounts specified in the agreement, such as dividends.\nEversource issued 6,000,000 common shares under the forward sale agreement in December 2019. On March 23, 2020, Eversource physically settled a portion of the forward sale agreement by delivering 1,500,000 common shares in exchange for net proceeds of $105.7 million. Subsequently, on March 26, 2020, Eversource physically settled the remaining portion of the forward sale agreement by delivering 4,460,000 common shares in exchange for net proceeds of $314.1 million. The forward sale price used to determine the cash proceeds received by Eversource was calculated based on the initial forward sale price, as adjusted in accordance with the forward sale agreement.\nThe March and June 2020 common share issuances of 5,960,000 and 6,000,000, respectively, resulted in total proceeds of $929.0 million, net of issuance costs. The June and December 2019 common share issuances of 5,980,000 and 6,000,000, respectively, resulted in total proceeds of $852.3 million. These issuances were reflected in shareholders\u2019 equity and as financing activities on the statements of cash flows.\nIssuances of shares under the forward sale agreement were classified as equity transactions. Accordingly, no amounts relating to the forward sale agreement were recorded in the financial statements until settlements took place. Prior to any settlements, the only impact of the forward sale agreement to the financial statements was the inclusion of incremental shares within the calculation of diluted EPS using the treasury stock method. See Note 21, \"Earnings Per Share,\" to the financial statements for information on the forward sale agreement\u2019s impact on the calculation of diluted EPS.\nEversource used the net proceeds received from the direct issuance of common shares and the net proceeds received from settlement of the forward sale agreement to repay short-term debt under the commercial paper program, to partially fund the purchase of the assets of CMA, to fund capital spending and clean energy initiatives, and for general corporate purposes.\nCash Flows: Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $1.68 billion in 2020, compared with $2.01 billion in 2019. Operating cash flows were unfavorably impacted by the timing of cash collections on our accounts receivable, the timing of collections for regulatory tracking mechanisms primarily related to transmission costs and the impact of the CL&P temporary rate suspension, and cash payments made in 2020 for storm restoration costs of approximately $196 million related to Tropical Storm Isaias. Also contributing to the unfavorable impact was the absence of $68.8 million in DOE Phase IV proceeds received by CYAPC and YAEC in 2019. Partially offsetting these unfavorable impacts were the favorable timing of cash payments made on our accounts payable, the absence of a $29.0 million payment made in 2019 to the DOE by CYAPC to partially settle its pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel obligation, and a decrease of $10.3 million in Pension and PBOP contributions made in 2020, as compared to 2019.\nOur receivables, net of reserves, on the balance sheet have increased $206.5 million ($58.3 million at CL&P, $56.3 million at NSTAR Electric, and $20.0 million at PSNH) in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to an increase in delinquent receivables from customers attributable to the moratorium on disconnections and the economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Receivables, net of reserves, also increased due to the addition of EGMA of $65.8 million as of December 31, 2020.\nCash flows provided by operating activities totaled $2.01 billion in 2019, compared with $1.83 billion in 2018. The increase in operating cash flows was due primarily to a decrease in 2019 of approximately $148 million of major storm restoration cost payments, $116 million in lower payments made in 2019 to the DOE by CYAPC to partially settle its pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel obligation, and a $73.2 million decrease in pension and PBOP cash contributions made in 2019, as compared to 2018. Also contributing to the increase were $102.8 million of lower income tax payments made in 2019, as compared to 2018, $68.8 million in DOE Phase IV litigation proceeds received by CYAPC and YAEC in 2019, and the timing of cash collections on our accounts receivables. Partially offsetting these favorable impacts were the timing of collections for regulatory tracking mechanisms, which were significantly impacted by the timing of collections of purchased power and transmission costs at NSTAR Electric, and the timing of accounts payable cash payments and other working capital items.\nIn 2020, we paid cash dividends of $744.7 million and issued non-cash dividends of $22.8 million in the form of treasury shares, totaling dividends of $767.5 million, or $2.27 per common share. In 2019, we paid cash dividends of $663.2 million and issued non-cash dividends of $22.8 million in the form of treasury shares, totaling dividends of $686.0 million, or $2.14 per common share. Our quarterly common share dividend payment was $0.5675 per share in 2020, as compared to $0.535 per share in 2019. On February 9, 2021, our Board of Trustees approved a common share dividend payment of $0.6025 per share, payable on March 31, 2021 to shareholders of record as of March 4, 2021. The 2021 dividend represents an increase of 6.2 percent over the dividend paid in December 2020.\nBeginning in 2019, Eversource issues treasury shares to satisfy awards under the Company's incentive plans, shares issued under the dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan, and matching contributions under the Eversource 401k Plan.\nIn 2020, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH paid $69.5 million, $262.0 million and $22.3 million, respectively, in common stock dividends to Eversource parent.\nInvestments in Property, Plant and Equipment on the statements of cash flows do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, AFUDC related to equity funds, and the capitalized and deferred portions of pension and PBOP expense. In 2020, investments for Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH were $2.94 billion, $834.0 million, $907.0 million and $342.6 million, respectively.\nOn October 9, 2020, Eversource completed the CMA asset acquisition for a cash purchase price of $1.1 billion plus a target working capital amount of $69.6 million, which is subject to adjustment to reflect actual working capital as of the closing date. The purchase price included in investing cash outflows on the statement of cash flows of $1.11 billion reflects the payment to NiSource, which excludes restricted cash accounts Eversource funded of $56.8 million. For further information, see \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures - Acquisition of Assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts\" included in this Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis.\nEversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each uses its available capital resources to fund its respective construction expenditures, meet debt requirements, pay operating costs, including storm-related costs, pay dividends, and fund other corporate obligations, such as pension contributions. Eversource's regulated companies recover their electric, natural gas and water distribution construction expenditures as the related project costs are depreciated over the life of the assets. This impacts the timing of the revenue stream designed to fully recover the total investment plus a return on the equity and debt used to finance the investments. The current growth in Eversource's construction expenditures utilizes a significant amount of cash for projects that have a long-term return on investment and recovery period, totaling approximately $2.94 billion in cash capital spend in 2020. In addition, Eversource's investments in its offshore wind business totaled $237.8 million in 2020, which are recognized as long-term assets. These factors have resulted in current liabilities exceeding current assets by $1.78 billion, $316.3 million, and $271.3 million at Eversource, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $1.02 billion of Eversource's long-term debt, including $450.0 million, $250.0 million, $282.0 million, and $40.2 million for Eversource parent, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, and Aquarion, respectively, will mature within the next 12 months. The current portion of long-term debt on the Eversource balance sheet also includes $31.0 million related to fair value adjustments from our various business combinations that will be amortized within the next 12 months and have no cash flow impact. Eversource, with its strong credit ratings, has several options available in the financial markets to repay or refinance these maturities with the issuance of new long-term debt. Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH will reduce their short-term borrowings with operating cash flows or with the issuance of new long-term debt, determined by considering capital requirements and maintenance of Eversource's credit rating and profile.\nWe expect the future operating cash flows of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, along with our existing borrowing availability and access to both debt and equity markets, will be sufficient to meet any working capital and future operating requirements, and capital investment forecasted opportunities.\nCredit Ratings: A summary of our corporate credit ratings and outlooks by S&P, Moody's, and Fitch is as follows:\nA summary of the current credit ratings and outlooks by S&P, Moody's, and Fitch for senior unsecured debt of Eversource parent and NSTAR Electric, and senior secured debt of CL&P and PSNH is as follows:\nBusiness Development and Capital Expenditures\nOur consolidated capital expenditures, including amounts incurred but not paid, cost of removal, AFUDC, and the capitalized and deferred portions of pension and PBOP expense (all of which are non-cash factors), totaled $3.06 billion in 2020, $3.06 billion in 2019, and $2.86 billion in 2018. These amounts included $239.1 million in 2020, $239.0 million in 2019, and $184.6 million in 2018 related to information technology and facilities upgrades and enhancements, primarily at Eversource Service and The Rocky River Realty Company.\nElectric Transmission Business: Our consolidated electric transmission business capital expenditures decreased by $75.8 million in 2020, as compared to 2019. A summary of electric transmission capital expenditures by company is as follows:\nEastern Massachusetts Transmission Projects: These projects consist of a portfolio of electric transmission upgrades in southern New Hampshire, northern Massachusetts and continuing into the greater Boston metropolitan area, of which 28 upgrades are in Eversource's service territory (two in New Hampshire and 26 in Massachusetts). The two New Hampshire upgrades, including the Merrimack Valley Reliability Project, have been placed in service, and 23 Massachusetts upgrades have been placed in service. On December 17, 2019, the Massachusetts Siting Board issued a favorable decision on the Sudbury-Hudson Reliability Project, the last project requiring such approval. On January 17, 2020, the Town of Sudbury and Protect Sudbury, a community group, appealed the decision to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Oral arguments are scheduled for March 1, 2021. The majority of remaining upgrades are under construction and are expected to be placed in service in 2022. We estimate our portion of the investment will be approximately $750 million, of which $525 million has been spent and capitalized through December 31, 2020.\nSoutheastern Massachusetts Transmission Projects: These projects consist of a portfolio of electric transmission and substation upgrades in southeastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod, required to reinforce the Southeastern Massachusetts transmission system and bring the system into compliance with applicable national and regional reliability standards. ISO-NE reassessed the need for projects that had yet to be constructed and reconfirmed the need for the majority of the originally identified reinforcements in July 2020. Twelve upgrades in Eversource's service territory were reconfirmed, and a single upgrade was deemed to no longer be required. Of the twelve upgrades, four require siting approvals from the Massachusetts regulatory agencies, of which one has received approval, two are before the agencies and one, a joint project with National Grid, has yet to be filed. Three substation projects will be permitted locally, three projects are under construction and two projects have been placed in-service. We estimate our portion of the investment will be approximately $175 million, of which $28 million has been spent and capitalized through December 31, 2020.\nHartford-Area Transmission Projects: This portfolio of projects consisted of 27 projects in the Hartford, Connecticut area. In the third quarter of 2020, the final projects were placed in service and as of December 31, 2020, CL&P has spent and capitalized $303 million in costs associated with this portfolio. Additional restoration costs in the first quarter of 2021 will bring the total investment to approximately $304 million.\nSeacoast Reliability Project: The Seacoast Reliability Project consisted of a 13-mile, 115kV transmission line within several New Hampshire communities, using a combination of overhead, underground and underwater line designs that helped meet the growing demand for electricity in the Seacoast region. The project was placed in service on May 29, 2020 and resulted in an investment of approximately $124 million.\nReady Path Solution: The Ready Path Solution was chosen in 2020 by ISO-NE as part of the first competitive solicitation for reliability upgrades in New England to meet the energy shortfall that will be created with the retirement of the Mystic Generating Station in Massachusetts in 2024. Our portion of the portfolio consists of installing new equipment at Eversource\u2019s existing North Cambridge Substation with an estimated investment of approximately $14 million. The project is advancing permitting and engineering with construction scheduled to start in 2021.\nAll project costs are anticipated to be fully recoverable through transmission rates.\nDistribution Business: A summary of distribution capital expenditures is as follows:\nFor the electric distribution business, basic business includes the purchase of meters, tools, vehicles, information technology, transformer replacements, equipment facilities, and the relocation of plant. Aging infrastructure relates to reliability and the replacement of overhead lines, plant substations, underground cable replacement, and equipment failures. Load growth and other includes requests for new business and capacity additions on distribution lines and substation additions and expansions.\nFor the natural gas distribution business, basic business addresses daily operational needs including meters, pipe relocations due to public works projects, vehicles, and tools. Aging infrastructure projects seek to improve the reliability of the system through enhancements related to cast iron and bare steel replacement of main and services, corrosion mediation, and station upgrades. Load growth and other reflects growth in existing service territories including new developments, installation of services, and expansion.\nFor the water distribution business, basic business addresses daily operational needs including periodic meter replacement, water main relocation, facility maintenance, and tools. Aging infrastructure relates to reliability and the replacement of water mains, regulators, storage tanks, pumping stations, wellfields, reservoirs, and treatment facilities. Load growth and other reflects growth in our service territory, including improvements of acquisitions, installation of new services, and interconnections of systems.\nAcquisition of Assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts: On October 9, 2020, Eversource acquired certain assets and liabilities that comprised NiSource\u2019s natural gas distribution business in Massachusetts, which was previously doing business as CMA, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement (the Agreement) entered into on February 26, 2020 between Eversource and NiSource Inc. (NiSource). The cash purchase price was $1.1 billion, plus a target working capital amount of $69.6 million, which is subject to adjustment to reflect actual working capital as of the closing date that has not yet been finalized. Eversource financed the asset acquisition through a combination of debt and equity issuances in a ratio that was consistent with our consolidated capital structure. The natural gas distribution assets acquired from CMA were assigned to EGMA, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Eversource formed in 2020. The LNG assets acquired from CMA were assigned to Hopkinton LNG Corp. EGMA distributes natural gas to approximately 332,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers with over 5,000 miles of natural gas distribution pipeline across more than 60 communities in Massachusetts, adding to the approximately 303,000 natural gas customers that Eversource already serves in Massachusetts.\nThe transaction required approval by the DPU, the Maine Public Utilities Commission, the FERC, and the Federal Communications Commission, and review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.\nThe liabilities assumed by Eversource under the Agreement specifically excluded any liabilities (past or future) arising out of, or related to, the fires and explosions that occurred on September 13, 2018 in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, Massachusetts related to the delivery of natural gas by CMA, including certain subsequent events, all as described and in the DPU's Order on Scope dated December 23, 2019 (D.P.U. 19-141) (the Greater Lawrence Incident or GLI). The liabilities assumed also excluded any further emergency events prior to the closing of the acquisition related to the restoration and reconstruction with respect to the GLI, including any losses arising out of, or related to, any litigation, demand, cause of action, claim, suit, investigation, proceeding, indemnification agreements or rights. Eversource did not assume any of CMA's or NiSource Inc.'s third party debt obligations or notes payable.\nEGMA Rate Settlement Agreement: On October 7, 2020, the DPU approved a rate settlement agreement, which requested approval of the February 26, 2020 asset purchase agreement between Eversource and NiSource, as well as a rate stabilization plan, among other items. The settlement agreement included an authorized regulatory ROE of 9.70 percent as of January 1, 2021, a 53.25 percent equity component of its capital structure, and established rate base equal to $995 million as of the closing on October 9, 2020.\nThe approved rate stabilization plan includes base distribution rate increases of $13 million on November 1, 2021 and $10 million on November 1, 2022. The settlement agreement includes two rate base resets during an eight-year rate plan, occurring on November 1, 2024 and November 1, 2027. The two rate base resets adjust distribution rates to account for capital additions (including the roll-in of GSEP capital additions), depreciation expense, property taxes, and return on rate base for capital additions placed into service through December 31, 2023, for the first rate base reset occurring on November 1, 2024, and through December 31, 2026, for the second rate base reset occurring on November 1, 2027. Notwithstanding the two distribution rate increases, the two rate base reset provisions, and potential adjustments for qualifying exogenous events, EGMA agreed not to file for an increase or redesign of distribution base rates effective prior to November 1, 2028.\nThe settlement agreement also permits EGMA to seek recovery of both transaction and integration costs as a result of the asset acquisition after December 31, 2026, subject to DPU review and approval, and subject to certain conditions, such as demonstrating savings resulting from the acquisition.\nProjected Capital Expenditures: A summary of the projected capital expenditures for the regulated companies' electric transmission and for the total electric distribution, natural gas distribution and water distribution for 2021 through 2025, including information technology and facilities upgrades and enhancements on behalf of the regulated companies, is as follows:\nThe projections do not include investments related to offshore wind projects. Actual capital expenditures could vary from the projected amounts for the companies and years above.\nOffshore Wind Business: Our offshore wind business includes ownership interests in North East Offshore and Bay State Wind, which together hold PPAs and contracts for the Revolution Wind, South Fork Wind and Sunrise Wind projects, as well as offshore leases issued by BOEM. Our offshore wind projects are being developed and constructed through a joint and equal partnership with \u00d8rsted. This partnership also participates in new procurement opportunities for offshore wind energy in the Northeast U.S.\nEversource has a 50 percent ownership interest in North East Offshore, which holds the Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind projects, as well as a 257 square-mile ocean lease off the coasts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Eversource also has a 50 percent ownership interest in Bay State Wind, which holds the Sunrise Wind project. Bay State Wind's separate 300-square-mile ocean lease is located approximately 25 miles south of the coast of Massachusetts adjacent to the North East Offshore area. In aggregate, the Bay State Wind and the North East Offshore ocean lease sites jointly-owned by Eversource and \u00d8rsted could eventually develop at least 4,000 MW of clean, renewable offshore wind energy. As of December 31, 2020, Eversource's total equity investment balance in its offshore wind business was $887.1 million, an increase of $237.8 million, as compared to 2019.\nWe are preparing our final project designs and advancing the appropriate federal, state and local siting and permitting processes along with our offshore wind partner, \u00d8rsted, all of which is competitively sensitive. We currently expect to make investments in our offshore wind business of approximately $300 million to $500 million during 2021, subject to advancing our final project designs and federal, state and local permitting processes.\nThe following table provides a summary of the Eversource and \u00d8rsted major projects with announced contracts:\n(1) The pricing for the Revolution Wind contracts in Connecticut has not been publicly disclosed.\n(2) Index Offshore Wind Renewable Energy Certificate (OREC) strike price.\n(3) The Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) agreed to expand the original 20-year PPA from 90 MW to 130 MW through an amendment to the original agreement. The amendment is awaiting final approval from the New York Comptroller's Office.\nOur offshore wind projects are subject to receipt of federal, state and local approvals necessary to construct and operate the projects. The federal permitting process is governed by BOEM, and state approvals are required from New York, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Significant delays in the siting and permitting process resulting from the timeline for obtaining approval from BOEM and the state and local agencies, as well as the impact of COVID-19, could adversely impact the timing of these projects' in-service dates.\nFederal Siting and Permitting Process: The South Fork Wind project has commenced the federal siting and permitting process with the filing of its Construction Operations Plan (COP) application with BOEM in 2018. The first major milestone in the BOEM review process is an issuance of a Notice of Intent to complete an Environmental Impact Statement (NOI), which South Fork Wind received in 2018. In August 2020, we received the final review schedule from BOEM regarding South Fork Wind\u2019s COP approval. In January 2021, BOEM released its Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the South Fork Wind project, which assessed the environmental, social, and economic impacts of constructing the project. Identified impacts were negligible to major adverse impacts to marine and terrestrial archaeological resources and to historic, and non-historic visual resources from project construction and operations. The Draft EIS also analyzed four alternatives to be evaluated as part of the process. Each of the identified alternative configurations had a similar level of environmental impacts, and if an alternative configuration was selected, the South Fork Wind project would still meet the contractual output under its PPA. A Final EIS is expected in the third quarter of 2021 and a final decision is expected in January 2022.\nBased on BOEM\u2019s final review schedule and final United States Army Corps of Engineers approval, we expect to start construction on South Fork in early 2022. South Fork Wind is designated as a \u201cCovered Project\u201d pursuant to Title 41 of the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act (FAST41) and a Major Infrastructure Project under Section 3(e) of Executive Order 13807, which provides greater federal attention on meeting the project\u2019s permitting timelines.\nRevolution Wind and Sunrise Wind filed their COP applications with BOEM in March 2020 and September 2020, respectively. Both projects received FAST41 designation in 2020. We are awaiting BOEM to outline its timeline for completing the review of each of the Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind COPs in an NOI, which we expect to receive in 2021.\nState and Local Siting and Permitting Process: South Fork Wind commenced the New York state siting process in 2018. On September 17, 2020, South Fork Wind filed a Joint Proposal in the New York State Article VII siting application. Amongst other things, the Joint Proposal included proposed mitigations to certain environmental, community and construction impacts associated with constructing electrical infrastructure. South Fork Wind was initially joined by PSEG Long Island and several citizens advocacy organizations. On October 9, 2020, the Joint Proposal was signed by the New York Departments of Public Service, Environmental Conservation, Transportation and State as well as the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. Hearings in the state siting process concluded in December 2020 and a decision is expected in mid-2021.\nOn September 10, 2020, the Town of East Hampton and the East Hampton Town Trustees announced that they had reached an agreement with South Fork Wind to issue the necessary easements and other real estate rights necessary to construct the South Fork Wind project. The Town approved the easements on January 21, 2021 and Trustees approved the lease on January 25, 2021.\nState permitting applications in Rhode Island for Revolution Wind and in New York for Sunrise Wind were filed in December 2020. The Revolution Wind application was deemed complete on January 22, 2021 and the preliminary hearing is set for March 22, 2021.\nProjected In-Service Dates: Based on BOEM\u2019s confirmed permit schedule outlining when BOEM will complete its review of the South Fork Wind COP, we now expect the South Fork Wind project to be in-service by the end of 2023. For Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind, we do not have a definitive timeline on when we will receive BOEM\u2019s NOIs. At this time, we believe that it is unlikely that the projected in-service dates of the end of 2023 and the end of 2024 for Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind, respectively, will be met. We are currently awaiting the receipt of BOEM\u2019s NOIs for Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind, which we expect to receive in 2021, in order to conclude on projected in-service dates.\nFERC Regulatory Matters\nFERC ROE Complaints: Four separate complaints were filed at the FERC by combinations of New England state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, consumer advocates, consumer groups, municipal parties and other parties (collectively, the Complainants). In each of the first three complaints, filed on October 1, 2011, December 27, 2012, and July 31, 2014, respectively, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE of 11.14 percent that had been utilized since 2005 and sought an order to reduce it prospectively from the date of the final FERC order and for the separate 15-month complaint periods. In the fourth complaint, filed April 29, 2016, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE billed of 10.57 percent and the maximum ROE for transmission incentive (incentive cap) of 11.74 percent, asserting that these ROEs were unjust and unreasonable.\nThe ROE originally billed during the period October 1, 2011 (beginning of the first complaint period) through October 15, 2014 consisted of a base ROE of 11.14 percent and incentives up to 13.1 percent. On October 16, 2014, the FERC set the base ROE at 10.57 percent and the incentive cap at 11.74 percent for the first complaint period. This was also effective for all prospective billings to customers beginning October 16, 2014. This FERC order was vacated on April 14, 2017 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the Court).\nAll amounts associated with the first complaint period have been refunded. Eversource has recorded a reserve of $39.1 million (pre-tax and excluding interest) for the second complaint period as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. This reserve represents the difference between the billed rates during the second complaint period and a 10.57 percent base ROE and 11.74 percent incentive cap. The reserve consisted of $21.4 million for CL&P, $14.6 million for NSTAR Electric and $3.1 million for PSNH as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nOn October 16, 2018, FERC issued an order on all four complaints describing how it intends to address the issues that were remanded by the Court. FERC proposed a new framework to determine (1) whether an existing ROE is unjust and unreasonable and, if so, (2) how to calculate a replacement ROE. Initial briefs were filed by the NETOs, Complainants and FERC Trial Staff on January 11, 2019 and reply briefs were filed on March 8, 2019. The NETOs' brief was supportive of the overall ROE methodology determined in the October 16, 2018 order provided the FERC does not change the proposed methodology or alter its implementation in a manner that has a material impact on the results.\nThe FERC order included illustrative calculations for the first complaint using FERC's proposed frameworks with financial data from that complaint. Those illustrative calculations indicated that for the first complaint period, for the NETOs, which FERC concludes are of average financial risk, the preliminary just and reasonable base ROE is 10.41 percent and the preliminary incentive cap on total ROE is 13.08 percent.\nIf the results of the illustrative calculations were included in a final FERC order for each of the complaint periods, then a 10.41 percent base ROE and a 13.08 percent incentive cap would not have a significant impact on our financial statements for all of the complaint periods. These preliminary calculations are not binding and do not represent what we believe to be the most likely outcome of a final FERC order.\nOn November 21, 2019, FERC issued Opinion No. 569 affecting the two pending transmission ROE complaints against the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) transmission owners, in which FERC adopted a new methodology for determining base ROEs. Various parties sought rehearing. On December 23, 2019, the NETOs filed supplementary materials in the NETOs' four pending cases to respond to this new methodology because of the uncertainty of the applicability to the NETOs' cases.\nOn May 21, 2020, the FERC issued its order in Opinion No. 569-A on the rehearing of the MISO transmission owners' cases, in which FERC again changed its methodology for determining the MISO transmission owners' base ROEs. Various parties appealed the MISO transmission owners' opinion. On November 19, 2020, the FERC issued Opinion No. 569-B denying rehearing of Opinion No. 569-A and reaffirmed the methodology previously adopted in Opinion No. 569-A. The new methodology differs significantly from the methodology proposed by FERC in its October 16, 2018 order to determine the NETOs' base ROEs in its four pending cases.\nGiven the significant uncertainty regarding the applicability of the FERC opinions in the MISO transmission owners' two complaint cases to the NETOs' pending four complaint cases, Eversource concluded that there is no reasonable basis for a change to the reserve or recognized ROEs for any of the complaint periods at this time. As well, Eversource cannot reasonably estimate a range of any gain or loss for any of the four complaint proceedings at this time.\nEversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH currently record revenues at the 10.57 percent base ROE and incentive cap at 11.74 percent established in the October 16, 2014 FERC order.\nA change of 10 basis points to the base ROE used to establish the reserves would impact Eversource\u2019s after-tax earnings by an average of approximately $3 million for each of the four 15-month complaint periods. From the date of a final FERC order, a change of 10 basis points to the base ROE would impact Eversource\u2019s 2021 after-tax earnings by approximately $5 million, or $0.01 per share, per year, and will increase slightly over time as we continue to invest in our transmission infrastructure.\nFERC Notice of Inquiry on ROE: On March 21, 2019, FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) seeking comments from all stakeholders on FERC's policies for evaluating ROEs for electric public utilities, and interstate natural gas and oil pipelines. On June 26, 2019, the NETOs jointly filed comments supporting the methodology established in the FERC\u2019s October 16, 2018 order with minor enhancements going forward. The NETOs jointly filed reply comments in the FERC ROE NOI on July 26, 2019. On May 12, 2020, the NETOs filed supplemental comments in the NOI ROE docket. At this time, Eversource cannot predict how this proceeding will affect its transmission ROEs.\nFERC Notice of Inquiry and Proposed Rulemaking on Transmission Incentives: On March 21, 2019, FERC issued an NOI seeking comments on FERC's policies for implementing electric transmission incentives. On June 26, 2019, Eversource filed comments requesting that FERC retain policies that have been effective in encouraging new transmission investment and remain flexible enough to attract investment in new and emerging transmission technologies. Eversource filed reply comments on August 26, 2019. On March 20, 2020, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) on transmission incentives. The NOPR intends to revise FERC\u2019s electric transmission incentive policies to reflect competing uses of transmission due to generation resource mix, technological innovation and shifts in load patterns. FERC proposes to grant transmission incentives based on measurable project economics and reliability benefits to consumers rather than its current project risks and challenges framework. On July 1, 2020, Eversource filed comments generally supporting the NOPR. At this time, Eversource cannot predict how these proceedings will affect its transmission incentives.\nFERC Transmission Transparency Settlement: On December 28, 2015, FERC initiated a proceeding to review the NETOs' regional and local transmission formula rates due to a lack of transparency, finding that the formula rates appeared to lack sufficient details to determine how costs are derived and recovered in rates. Parties engaged in further settlement negotiations and reached an agreement in principle on October 22, 2019. On June 15, 2020, the NETOs filed an uncontested Settlement Agreement with FERC, which was signed by all six New England state regulatory commissions, New England States Committee on Electricity, New England Municipals and all the NETOs. On December 28, 2020, the FERC issued an order approving the Settlement Agreement, which establishes annual formula rate transparency procedures effective June 15, 2021, implements a new regional and local rate structure effective January 1, 2022, and contains a rate moratorium through December 31, 2024.\nRegulatory Developments and Rate Matters\nElectric, Natural Gas and Water Utility Base Distribution Rates: Each Eversource utility subsidiary is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the state in which it operates: CL&P, Yankee Gas and Aquarion operate in Connecticut and are subject to PURA regulation; NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Aquarion operate in Massachusetts and are subject to DPU regulation; and PSNH and Aquarion operate in New Hampshire and are subject to NHPUC regulation. The regulated companies' distribution rates are set by their respective state regulatory commissions, and their tariffs include mechanisms for periodically adjusting their rates for the recovery of specific incurred costs.\nIn Connecticut, electric and natural gas utilities are required to file a distribution rate case, or for PURA to initiate a rate review, within four years of the last rate case. CL&P's and Yankee Gas' distribution rates were each established in 2018 PURA-approved rate case settlement agreements. Aquarion is not required to initiate a rate review with the PURA on a set schedule. Aquarion rates were established in a 2013 PURA-approved rate case.\nIn Massachusetts, electric distribution companies are required to file at least one distribution rate case every five years, and natural gas local distribution companies to file at least one distribution rate case every 10 years, and those companies are limited to one settlement agreement in any 10-year period. NSTAR Electric's distribution rates were established in a 2017 DPU-approved rate case. NSTAR Gas' distribution rates were established in an October 2020 DPU-approved rate case. EGMA's distribution rates were established in an October 2020 DPU-approved rate settlement agreement. Aquarion is not required to initiate a rate review with the DPU. Aquarion rates were established in a 2018 DPU-approved rate case.\nIn New Hampshire, PSNH's distribution rates were established in a December 2020 NHPUC-approved rate case settlement agreement. Aquarion rates were established in a 2013 NHPUC-approved rate case, further revised in 2016. On December 18, 2020, Aquarion filed an application with the NHPUC for a permanent increase in base rates, effective February 1, 2021.\nSee \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Massachusetts\" and \"- New Hampshire,\" as well as \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures - Acquisition of Assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts\" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for more information on the NSTAR Gas, PSNH and EGMA 2020 rate approvals.\nElectric, Natural Gas and Water Utility Retail Rates: The Eversource electric distribution companies obtain and resell power to retail customers who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier. The natural gas distribution companies procure natural gas for firm and seasonal customers. These energy supply procurement costs are recovered from customers in energy supply rates that are approved by the respective state regulatory commission. The rates are reset periodically and are fully reconciled to their costs. Each electric and natural gas distribution company fully recovers its energy supply costs through approved regulatory rate mechanisms on a timely basis and, therefore, such costs have no impact on earnings.\nThe electric and natural gas distribution companies also recover certain other costs on a fully reconciling basis through regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms and, therefore, recovery of these costs has no impact on earnings. Costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include, among others, energy efficiency program costs, electric retail transmission charges, electric restructuring and stranded costs (including securitized RRB charges), and additionally for our Massachusetts companies, pension and PBOP benefits and net metering for distributed generation. The reconciliation filings compare the total actual costs allowed to revenue requirements related to these services and the difference between the costs incurred (or the rate recovery allowed) and the actual costs allowed is deferred and included, to be either recovered or refunded, in future customer rates. These cost tracking mechanisms also include certain incentives earned, return on rate base and on capital tracking mechanisms, and carrying charges that are billed in rates to customers, which do impact earnings.\nCOVID-19 Regulatory Dockets: In Connecticut, PURA opened a docket to address COVID-19 developments, including issuing orders on March 18, 2020, April 29, 2020 and May 15, 2020 that authorized electric, natural gas and water utilities to establish a regulatory asset for COVID-19 uncollectible customer receivable expenses and costs associated with the related orders. PURA\u2019s April 29, 2020 order, as supplemented on May 15, 2020, also allowed the inclusion of working capital costs in the regulatory asset, and authorized electric, natural gas and water utilities to establish a payment plan program designed to assist any customer who requests financial assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 10, 2020, PURA denied a request from a coalition of large industrial customers to reduce or suspend certain electric and natural gas charges during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn Massachusetts, on July 31, 2020, the DPU approved and adopted a coalition of electric, natural gas and water utilities\u2019 comprehensive Customer Assistance Plan involving extended payment plans and waiver of late fees, extended plans under available arrearage management plans (AMPs), and continuation of the Shut-Off Moratorium. On September 3, 2020, the DPU approved the 2020 small commercial arrearage forgiveness program (AFP) proposed by the electric and natural gas distribution companies. In its interim order dated December 31, 2020, the DPU established certain cost tracking and data reporting requirements for the distribution companies and will allow each company to record, defer, and track incremental cost areas, subject to the DPU\u2019s final determination of the ratemaking treatment in D.P.U. 20-58 and D.P.U. 20-91. In D.P.U. 20-91, the DPU will adjudicate the contested cost-recovery provisions identified in the Ratemaking Proposal and consider proposals to expand alternative customer bill payment options. The distribution companies\u2019 Ratemaking Proposal for COVID-19 financial-related impacts includes recovery requests for each of the following five cost categories: (1) cash working capital; (2) arrearage forgiveness; (3) bad debt; (4) COVID-19 O&M expenses; and (5) waived fees.\nIn New Hampshire, on October 5, 2020, the NHPUC approved an agreement governing collections and disconnection activities, deposit activities, flexible payment plans, and special arrangements for income-qualified customers for all New Hampshire utilities including Eversource\u2019s electric and water utilities. The terms of that agreement continue through at least April 2021. Also, on August 18, 2020, the NHPUC Staff recommended that utilities in New Hampshire be permitted to create a regulatory asset for waived fees and incremental bad debt related to the COVID-19 pandemic. On November 13, 2020, the NHPUC Staff revised its recommendation arguing that waived fees should not be included in any regulatory asset related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The New Hampshire utilities disputed that recommendation on December 4, 2020, and on December 16, 2020, the NHPUC Staff renewed its November 13, 2020 recommendation. The NHPUC has yet to act on that recommendation.\nFor information on COVID-19-related regulatory deferrals recorded and COVID-19 charges incurred, see \"Impact of COVID-19\" included in this Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis.\nStorm Event:\nOn August 4, 2020, Tropical Storm Isaias caused catastrophic damage to our electric distribution system, which resulted in significant amounts and durations of customer outages, primarily in Connecticut. In terms of customer outages, this storm was one of the worst in CL&P\u2019s history. PURA has opened an investigation into CL&P's response to Tropical Storm Isaias. PURA will also investigate the prudence of costs incurred by CL&P to restore service as part of its response. CL&P is fully participating in PURA\u2019s investigations and believes that these storm restoration costs were prudently incurred and meet the criteria for cost recovery. As a result, management does not expect the storm costs to have a material impact on the results of operations of Eversource or CL&P.\nBased on current estimates, the storm resulted in deferred storm restoration costs on our balance sheets of approximately $228 million at CL&P and $245 million at Eversource as of December 31, 2020. The estimated cost of restoration will change as additional cost information becomes available, final storm costs are deferred or capitalized, and post-storm restoration work is completed. The majority of incremental storm costs relate to third-party vendors that are external field crews needed to restore power and address municipal priorities. CL&P\u2019s current estimate of total storm costs includes its projection of the cost of such vendors, but that estimate will change as CL&P receives and examines all storm related invoices.\nConnecticut:\nCL&P Storm Investigation: On August 7, 2020, PURA issued a notice that it had opened a docket to investigate the preparation for and response to Tropical Storm Isaias by Connecticut utilities, including CL&P. Hearings were completed in January 2021 and a final decision is currently expected on April 28, 2021. If the April 28, 2021 final decision concludes that CL&P failed to comply with applicable storm performance standards, then a separate proceeding will be initiated on May 7, 2021 to examine if and what amount of any civil penalty could potentially be imposed on CL&P, with a final decision currently anticipated on July 14, 2021.\nCL&P Rate Suspension: On July 31, 2020, PURA temporarily suspended its June 26, 2020 approval of certain delivery rate components effective July 1, 2020, and ordered CL&P to restore rates to those in effect as of June 30, 2020 in order to allow PURA time to reexamine the rates to ensure that CL&P is not over-collecting revenues in the short-term. Rates were adjusted effective August 1, 2020. PURA indicated that this was due to the convergence of a number of recent events, including the COVID-19 crisis and its corresponding effect on customer energy usage, as well as the warmer than normal weather in July. On December 2, 2020, PURA issued a final decision in which it adjusted the timing of the annual rate adjustments for the Revenue Decoupling Mechanism Charge, the Transmission Adjustment Clause charge, the Non-Bypassable Federally Mandated Congestion Charge, and the Electric System Improvements Tracker so that these rates take effect on May 1st of each year, as opposed to the current process of adjusting rates each January 1 and July 1. The final decision also modified the calculation of carrying charges and shifted the timing of recovery to rely on more actual versus forecasted information, among other changes.\nThe temporary suspension of rates has resulted in a current period under-recovery of costs, which results in an increase to our regulatory assets, with no impact on the statement of income other than carrying charges, and a delay in the collection of our costs.\nMassachusetts:\nNSTAR Electric Distribution Rates: As part of an inflation-based mechanism, NSTAR Electric submitted its third annual Performance Based\nRate Adjustment filing on September 15, 2020 and the DPU approved a $29.9 million increase to base distribution rates on December 30, 2020 for effect on January 1, 2021.\nNSTAR Gas Rate Case: On October 30, 2020, the DPU approved a base distribution rate increase of $23.0 million effective November 1, 2020, compared to the original request of $38.0 million. NSTAR Gas' 2019 plant additions are allowed recovery beginning on November 1, 2021. Thus, the reduced revenue requirement reflects the removal of this recovery, among other adjustments. The DPU also approved NSTAR Gas' proposal to continue its ongoing Gas System Enhancement Program (GSEP), the inclusion of GSEP investments since 2015 into base rates, and the implementation of a 10-year performance-based ratemaking plan, which includes an inflation-based adjustment mechanism to annual base distribution rates. The decision allows an authorized regulatory ROE of 9.9 percent on a capital structure including 54.77 percent equity. The decision also approves a geothermal pilot program. The impact of the rate case decision resulted in a pre-tax charge to earnings in 2020 of $2.7 million at NSTAR Gas, primarily due to certain plant-related disallowances.\nSale of Water System: On July 31, 2020, we sold our water system and treatment plant that supplies water to the towns of Hingham, Hull and North Cohasset to the town of Hingham, Massachusetts. Net property, plant and equipment of $63.9 million and goodwill of $23.6 million were included in determining the gain on sale. Proceeds from the sale were $110.5 million, with a pre-tax gain of $16.0 million (after-tax gain of $3.5 million) recognized within Operations and Maintenance Expense on the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The assets and liabilities associated with the sale of the business were previously reflected in the Water Distribution segment and reporting unit.\nNew Hampshire:\nPSNH Distribution Rates: On June 27, 2019, the NHPUC approved a settlement agreement that was reached by PSNH, the NHPUC Staff, the Office of the Consumer Advocate, and another settling party, to implement a temporary annual base distribution rate increase of $28.3 million. Although new rates were implemented on August 1, 2019 to customers, the provisions of the temporary base distribution rate increase were effective July 1, 2019. The settlement agreement also permitted PSNH to recover approximately $68.5 million in unrecovered storm costs over a five-year period beginning August 1, 2019, with debt carrying charges, which is included in the temporary rate increase.\nOn May 28, 2019, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC for a permanent increase in base distribution rates of approximately $70 million, effective July 1, 2020, which included the temporary rate increase request. Temporary rates remained in effect with a reconciliation of permanent rates retroactive to July 1, 2019 once permanent rates were set.\nOn December 15, 2020, the NHPUC approved an October 9, 2020 settlement agreement on permanent rates between PSNH and all parties to the proceeding. The NHPUC approved a permanent rate increase of $45.0 million effective January 1, 2021, inclusive of the temporary rate increase referenced above. PSNH was also permitted three step increases, effective January 1, 2021, August 1, 2021, and August 1, 2022, to reflect plant additions in calendar years 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. On December 23, 2020, the NHPUC approved the first step adjustment for 2019 plant in service to recover a revenue requirement of $10.6 million, subject to reconciliation after completion of an audit, effective January 1, 2021. The settlement agreement also established an authorized regulatory ROE of 9.3 percent with a 54.4 percent common equity ratio in PSNH\u2019s capital structure and provided for a new tracker to recover regulatory assessments, vegetation management costs, property tax costs, and lost distribution revenue attributable to net metering. In addition, base distribution rates were adjusted to reflect the refund of EDIT from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nThe settlement agreement allowed for the effect of the permanent rate increase to be extended back to the temporary rate period. In lieu of a customer rate increase for this recoupment of revenue, the NHPUC directed a portion of the total EDIT regulatory liability to offset bill impacts to customers. The impact of the settlement agreement resulted in an after-tax benefit to earnings in 2020 of $11.0 million at Eversource ($7.2 million at PSNH), due primarily to the reconciliation of permanent rates back to the temporary rate period resulting in a reduction of the EDIT regulatory liability, which reduced Income Tax Expense on the statement of income, and the allowed recovery of previously expensed costs. The earnings impact was partially offset by the negative impact from the over-refunding of the change in the 2018 federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that was reflected in temporary rates, which reduced Operating Revenues on the statement of income.\nPSNH Generation Asset Divestiture-Related Costs: On May 15, 2020, the NHPUC Audit Staff issued a final report on the audit of PSNH\u2019s generation asset divestiture-related costs and resulting securitized and stranded costs. The findings in the audit report as well as other aspects of the divestiture process were further investigated by NHPUC Staff through the discovery phase, which was completed in July 2020. On September 30, 2020, PSNH filed a settlement agreement on the generation asset divestiture-related costs with the NHPUC Audit Staff. The settlement agreement resolved all issues with respect to PSNH\u2019s divestiture of its generating assets and the recovery of $12.0 million of divestiture-related costs incurred above the $635.7 million amount previously securitized. On December 17, 2020, the NHPUC approved the additional $12.0 million proposed in the settlement agreement to be recovered over a one-year period through the SCRC rate beginning February 1, 2021.\nLegislative and Policy Matters\nFederal: On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the $2.2 trillion bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Among other provisions, the CARES Act provides for loans and other benefits to small and large businesses, expanded unemployment insurance, direct payments to those with wages middle-income and below, new appropriations funding for health care and other priorities, and tax changes like deferrals of employer payroll tax liabilities coupled with an employee retention tax credit and rollbacks of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 limitations on net operating losses and certain business interest limitation. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we have recorded a tax liability of approximately $39 million related to the deferral of employer payroll tax liability provision. Fifty percent of the deferral of employer payroll tax liability must be paid by December 31, 2021 and the remaining amount by December 31, 2022. Other than the cash flow benefit described, the CARES Act did not have a material impact.\nOn December 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law H.R. 133, the \u201cConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.\u201d The House of Representatives and Senate previously passed the bill with overwhelming support. The legislation includes tax extenders as part of Division EE, the \u201cTaxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020.\u201d The provisions within the law include the extension of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar at 26 percent for facilities the construction of which begins through the end of 2022, at 22 percent for facilities the construction of which begins in 2023, and postponement of the date after which solar facilities placed in service receive only a 10 percent ITC to December 31, 2025, the extension of the ITC at 30 percent (with no phase-down) to offshore wind if construction begins by December 31, 2025 (qualifying offshore wind includes facilities located in the inland navigable waters or in the coastal waters of the U.S.), and the extension and expansion of the CARES Act employee retention tax credit for the period from January 1, 2021 through June 30, 2021, including increasing the credit rate from 50 percent to 70 percent of qualified wages, and increasing the per-employee creditable wages limit from $10,000 per year to $10,000 for each quarter. The tax credit provision impacts to Eversource are still being evaluated but are a significant positive development for the Company and provides the opportunity to generate additional tax credits in its renewable energy projects when the projects become operational.\nMassachusetts: On January 28, 2021, the Massachusetts Legislature approved legislation which permits electric or natural gas distribution companies to assist Massachusetts municipalities in responding to the risks of climate change by owning solar facilities equal to up to 10 percent of the total installed solar generating capacity in Massachusetts as of July 31, 2020. Such facilities may be paired with energy storage where feasible to do so. This legislation is anticipated to allow each of Eversource\u2019s Massachusetts operating companies to own up to approximately 280 MWs of solar generating facilities in addition to the 70 MWs previously constructed at NSTAR Electric.\nConnecticut: On October 8, 2020, Connecticut enacted Public Act 20-5 (House Bill Number 7006), September Special Session (the Act). The Act, among other things, (1) requires PURA to open a proceeding by June 1, 2021 to begin to evaluate and eventually implement performance based regulation for electric distribution companies, and permits PURA to open a proceeding to consider such regulation for natural gas and water companies; (2) extends deadlines for PURA to issue final decisions in rate cases, change of control transactions and financing proceedings to be more consistent with timeframes in many other U.S. jurisdictions; (3) increases the maximum potential penalty for noncompliance with storm performance standards from 2.5 percent to 4 percent of annual electric distribution company revenue; and (4) directed PURA to open a proceeding by January 1, 2021 to evaluate and decide when bill credits should be paid to electric customers who lose service in future storms, including when waivers of these criteria will be granted to utilities. PURA opened a docket on December 29, 2020 to evaluate when bill credits would be paid for new storms after July 1, 2021. This law has no impact on storm response, costs or impacts prior to July 1, 2021.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and, at times, difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Changes in these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our management discusses with the Audit Committee of our Board of Trustees significant matters relating to critical accounting policies. Our critical accounting policies are discussed below. See the combined notes to our financial statements for further information concerning the accounting policies, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRegulatory Accounting: Our regulated companies are subject to rate regulation that is based on cost recovery and meets the criteria for application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated operations, which considers the effect of regulation on the timing of the recognition of certain revenues and expenses. The regulated companies' financial statements reflect the effects of the rate-making process. The rates charged to the customers of our regulated companies are designed to collect each company's costs to provide service, plus a return on investment.\nThe application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory assets are amortized as the incurred costs are recovered through customer rates. In some cases, we record regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission. We must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. We base our conclusion on certain factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory precedent. Regulatory liabilities represent either revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customers.\nWe use judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities; however, regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs, and those conclusions could have a material impact on our financial statements. We believe it is probable that each of the regulated companies will recover its respective investments in long-lived assets and the regulatory assets that have been recorded. If we determine that we can no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises, or that we cannot conclude it is probable that costs will be recovered from customers in future rates, the applicable costs would be charged to net income in the period in which the determination is made.\nPension, SERP and PBOP: We sponsor Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans to provide retirement benefits to our employees. For each of these plans, several significant assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation, funded status and net periodic benefit cost. These assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, compensation/progression rate and mortality and retirement assumptions. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually and adjust them as necessary. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nExpected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets: In developing the expected long-term rate of return, we consider historical and expected returns, as well as input from our consultants. Our expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on assumptions regarding target asset allocations and corresponding expected rates of return for each asset class. We routinely review the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted asset allocations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our expected long-term rate-of-return assumption used to determine our pension and PBOP expense was 8.25 percent for the Eversource Service plans and 7 percent for the Aquarion plans. For the forecasted 2021 pension and PBOP expense, an expected long-term rate of return of 8.25 percent for the Eversource Service plans and 7 percent for the Aquarion plans will be used reflecting our target asset allocations.\nDiscount Rate: Payment obligations related to the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans are discounted at interest rates applicable to the expected timing of each plan's cash flows. The discount rate that was utilized in determining the pension, SERP and PBOP obligations was based on a yield-curve approach. This approach utilizes a population of bonds with an average rating of AA based on bond ratings by Moody's, S&P and Fitch, and uses bonds with above median yields within that population. As of December 31, 2020, the discount rates used to determine the funded status were within a range of 2.4 percent to 2.7 percent for the Pension and SERP Plans, and within a range of 2.5 percent to 2.6 percent for the PBOP Plans. As of December 31, 2019, the discount rates used were within a range of 3.0 percent to 3.4 percent for the Pension and SERP Plans, and within a range of 3.2 percent to 3.3 percent for the PBOP Plans. The decrease in the discount rates used to calculate the funded status resulted in an increase to the Pension and PBOP Plans' liability of $603.0 million and $68.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company uses the spot rate methodology for the service and interest cost components of Pension, SERP and PBOP expense because it provides a relatively precise measurement by matching projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. The discount rates used to estimate the 2020 expense were within a range of 2.6 percent to 3.5 percent for the Pension and SERP Plans, and within a range of 2.7 percent to 3.6 percent for the PBOP Plans.\nMortality Assumptions: Assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans are a key estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant may receive over their lifetime and the corresponding plan liability we need to record. In 2020, a revised scale for the mortality table was released, and we utilized it in our measurements.\nCompensation/Progression Rate: This assumption reflects the expected long-term salary growth rate, including consideration of the levels of increases built into collective bargaining agreements, and impacts the estimated benefits that Pension and SERP Plan participants receive in the future. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the compensation/progression rates used to determine the funded status were within a range of 3.5 percent to 4 percent.\nHealth Care Cost: The Eversource Service PBOP Plan is not subject to health care cost trends. As of December 31, 2020, for the Aquarion PBOP Plan, the health care trend rate for pre-65 retirees is 6.3 percent, with an ultimate rate of 5 percent in 2023, and for post-65 retirees, the health care trend rate and ultimate rate is 3.5 percent.\nActuarial Determination of Expense: Pension, SERP and PBOP expense is determined by our actuaries and consists of service cost and prior service cost, interest cost based on the discounting of the obligations, and amortization of actuarial gains and losses, offset by the expected return on plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses represent the amortization of differences between assumptions and actual information or updated assumptions. Pre-tax net periodic benefit expense for the Pension and SERP Plans was $56.9 million, $63.7 million and $39.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the PBOP Plans, there was net periodic PBOP income of $51.6 million, $41.5 million and $45.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the assumed long-term rate of return to the Pension and PBOP Plan asset balances. This calculated expected return is compared to the actual return or loss on plan assets at the end of each year to determine the investment gains or losses to be immediately reflected in unamortized actuarial gains and losses.\nForecasted Expenses and Expected Contributions: We estimate that expense in 2021 for the Pension and SERP Plans will be approximately $28 million and income in 2021 for the PBOP Plans will be approximately $58 million. Pension, SERP and PBOP expense for subsequent years will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and other assumptions, and various other factors related to the populations participating in the plans.\nOur policy is to fund the Pension Plans annually in an amount at least equal to the amount that will satisfy all federal funding requirements. We contributed $109.6 million to the Pension Plans in 2020. We currently estimate contributing $130.0 million to the Pension Plans in 2021.\nIt is our policy to fund the PBOP Plans annually through tax deductible contributions to external trusts. We contributed $1.9 million to the PBOP Plans in 2020. We currently estimate contributing $2.8 million to the PBOP Plans in 2021.\nSensitivity Analysis: The following represents the hypothetical increase to the Pension Plans' (excluding the SERP Plans) reported annual cost and a decrease to the PBOP Plans' reported annual income as a result of a change in the following assumptions by 50 basis points:\nGoodwill: We recorded goodwill on our balance sheet associated with previous mergers and acquisitions, which totaled $4.45 billion as of December 31, 2020. We have identified our reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill as Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution. Electric Distribution and Electric Transmission reporting units include carrying values for the respective components of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH. The Natural Gas Distribution reporting unit includes the carrying values of NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas and EGMA. We recorded $42 million of goodwill arising from the acquisition of CMA on October 9, 2020. The Water Distribution reporting unit includes the Aquarion water utility businesses. As of December 31, 2020, goodwill was allocated to the reporting units as follows: $2.54 billion to Electric Distribution, $577 million to Electric Transmission, $441 million to Natural Gas Distribution and $884 million to Water Distribution.\nWe are required to test goodwill balances for impairment at least annually by considering the fair values of the reporting units, which requires us to use estimates and judgments. We have selected October 1st of each year as the annual goodwill impairment test date. Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. If goodwill were deemed to be impaired, it would be written down in the current period to the extent of the impairment.\nWe performed an impairment test of goodwill as of October 1, 2020 for the Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution reporting units. This evaluation required the consideration of several factors that impact the fair value of the reporting units, including conditions and assumptions that affect the future cash flows of the reporting units. Key considerations include discount rates, utility sector market performance and merger transaction multiples, and internal estimates of future cash flows and net income.\nThe 2020 goodwill impairment assessment resulted in a conclusion that goodwill is not impaired and no reporting unit is at risk of a goodwill impairment. The fair value of the reporting units was substantially in excess of carrying value.\nLong-Lived Assets: Impairment evaluations of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and other assets, involve a significant degree of estimation and judgment, including identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist. Impairment analysis is required when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Indicators of potential impairment include a deteriorating business climate, unfavorable regulatory action, decline in value that is other than temporary in nature, plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life, and accumulation of costs that are in excess of amounts allowed for recovery. The review of long-lived assets for impairment utilizes significant assumptions about operating strategies and external developments, including assessment of current and projected market conditions that can impact future cash flows.\nImpairment of Northern Pass Transmission: Northern Pass was Eversource's planned 1,090 MW HVDC transmission line that would have interconnected from the Qu\u00e9bec-New Hampshire border to Franklin, New Hampshire and an associated alternating current radial transmission line between Franklin and Deerfield, New Hampshire. As a result of a final decision received on July 19, 2019 from the New Hampshire Supreme Court, whereby the court denied Northern Pass\u2019 appeal and affirmed the NHSEC\u2019s denial of Northern Pass\u2019 siting application on NPT, Eversource concluded that construction of NPT was no longer probable and that there was no constructive path forward for the project. In 2019, Eversource terminated the project and permanently abandoned any further development.\nBased on the conclusion that the construction of Northern Pass was no longer probable, Eversource recorded an impairment charge in 2019 for all of the project costs associated with Northern Pass, which were primarily engineering design, siting, permitting and legal costs, along with appropriate allowances for funds used during construction, and recognized a receivable for certain cost reimbursement agreements. Additionally, Eversource recorded an impairment charge associated with the land acquired to construct Northern Pass in order to recognize the land at its estimated fair value based on assessed values and transaction costs. In total, this resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $239.6 million within Operating Income on the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2019, and was reflected in the Electric Transmission segment. The after-tax impact of the impairment charge was $204.4 million, or $0.64 per share, after giving effect to the estimated fair value of the related land, reimbursement agreements, and the impact of expected income tax benefits associated with the impairment charge. As a result of the decision to terminate the NPT project and permanently abandon any further development, Eversource does not expect any future cash expenditures associated with this project.\nEquity Method Investments: Investments in affiliates where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee are initially recognized as an equity method investment at cost. Any differences between the cost of an investment and the amount of underlying equity in net assets of an investee are considered basis differences and are determined based upon the estimated fair values of the investee's identifiable assets and liabilities. For our offshore wind equity method investment, basis differences are related to intangible assets for PPAs that will be amortized over the term of the PPAs, and equity method goodwill that are not amortized. Capitalized interest associated with our offshore wind equity method investment is included in the investment balance.\nEquity method investments are assessed for impairment when conditions exist that indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than book value. If the decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value, which establishes a new cost basis in the investment. Impairment evaluations involve a significant degree of judgment and estimation, including identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist and developing an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows.\nIn 2020, Eversource recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $2.8 million within Other Income, Net on the statement of income, related to a write-off of an investment within a renewable energy fund.\nIn 2018, Eversource recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $32.9 million within Other Income, Net on our statement of income, related to Access Northeast, an equity method investment. Eversource identified a September 2018 non-Eversource natural gas series of explosions in eastern Massachusetts, compounded by an adverse legislative environment, as negative evidence that indicated potential impairment of our investment in Access Northeast. In 2018, management determined that the future cash flows of the Access Northeast project were uncertain and could no longer be reasonably estimated and that the book value of our equity method investment was not recoverable. On April 1, 2019, pursuant to a provision in the partnership agreement jointly entered into by Eversource, Enbridge, Inc. and National Grid plc, through Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC, the Access Northeast project was terminated.\nIncome Taxes: Income tax expense is estimated for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and is recorded each quarter using an estimated annualized effective tax rate. This process to record income tax expense involves estimating current and deferred income tax expense or benefit and the impact of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial reporting and income tax return reporting purposes. Such differences are the result of timing of the deduction for expenses, as well as any impact of permanent differences, non-tax deductible expenses, or other items that directly impact income tax expense as a result of regulatory activity (flow-through items). The temporary differences and flow-through items result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in the balance sheets.\nWe also account for uncertainty in income taxes, which applies to all income tax positions previously filed in a tax return and income tax positions expected to be taken in a future tax return that have been reflected on our balance sheets. The determination of whether a tax position meets the recognition threshold under applicable accounting guidance is based on facts and circumstances available to us.\nPursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Eversource had remeasured its existing deferred federal income tax balances to reflect the decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. The remeasurement resulted in provisional regulated excess accumulated deferred income tax (excess ADIT or EDIT) liabilities that will benefit our customers in future periods. As of December 31, 2020, these EDIT liabilities were estimated to be approximately $2.78 billion and were included in regulatory liabilities on the balance sheet. Eversource's regulated companies are in the process of, or will be, refunding the EDIT liabilities to customers based on orders issued by applicable state regulatory commissions. The refund of these regulatory liabilities to customers will generally be made over the same period as the remaining useful lives of the underlying assets that gave rise to the ADIT liabilities.\nAccounting for Environmental Reserves: Environmental reserves are accrued when assessments indicate it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Increases to estimates of environmental liabilities could have an adverse impact on earnings. We estimate these liabilities based on findings through various phases of the assessment, considering the most likely action plan from a variety of available remediation options (ranging from no action required to full site remediation and long-term monitoring), current site information from our site assessments, remediation estimates from third party engineering and remediation contractors, and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites. If a most likely action plan cannot yet be determined, we estimate the liability based on the low end of a range of possible action plans. A significant portion of our environmental sites and reserve amounts relate to former MGP sites that were operated several decades ago and manufactured natural gas from coal and other processes, which resulted in certain by-products remaining in the environment that may pose a potential risk to human health and the environment, for which we may have potential liability. Estimates are based on the expected remediation plan. Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information from other sources, including the level of contamination at the site, the extent of our responsibility or the extent of remediation required, recently enacted laws and regulations or a change in cost estimates.\nFair Value Measurements: We follow fair value measurement guidance that defines fair value as the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). We have applied this guidance to our Company's derivative contracts that are not elected or designated as \"normal purchases or normal sales\" (normal), to marketable securities held in trusts, and to our investments in our Pension and PBOP Plans. Fair value measurements are also incorporated into the accounting for goodwill, long-lived assets, equity method investments, and AROs, and in the valuation of the acquisition of CMA in 2020. The fair value measurement guidance was also applied in estimating the fair value of preferred stock, long-term debt and RRBs.\nChanges in fair value of our derivative contracts are recorded as Regulatory Assets or Liabilities, as we recover the costs of these contracts in rates charged to customers. These valuations are sensitive to the prices of energy and energy-related products in future years for which markets have not yet developed and assumptions are made.\nWe use quoted market prices when available to determine the fair value of financial instruments. When quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar instruments are not available, we value derivative contracts using models that incorporate both observable and unobservable inputs. Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the models include energy and energy-related product prices for future years for long-dated derivative contracts and market volatilities. Discounted cash flow valuations incorporate estimates of premiums or discounts, reflecting risk-adjusted profit that would be required by a market participant to arrive at an exit price, using available historical market transaction information. Valuations of derivative contracts also reflect our estimates of nonperformance risk, including credit risk.\nOther Matters\nAccounting Standards: For information regarding new accounting standards, see Note 1C, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Accounting Standards,\" to the financial statements.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments: Information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2020, is summarized annually through 2025 and thereafter as follows:\n(a) Long-term debt maturities exclude the CYAPC pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel obligation, net unamortized premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs, and other fair value adjustments.\n(b) Estimated interest payments on fixed-rate debt are calculated by multiplying the coupon rate on the debt by its scheduled notional amount outstanding for the period of measurement.\n(c) The operating and finance lease obligations include interest.\n(d) Amounts are not included on our balance sheets.\n(e) These amounts represent expected pension and PBOP contributions for 2021. Future contributions will vary depending on many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets, valuation of the plans' liabilities and long-term discount rates.\n(f) Other than certain derivative contracts held by the regulated companies, these obligations are not included on our balance sheets.\n(g) Does not include other long-term liabilities recorded on our balance sheet, such as environmental reserves, employee medical insurance, workers compensation and long-term disability insurance reserves, ARO liability reserves and other reserves, as we cannot make reasonable estimates of the timing of payments. Also, does not include amounts not included on our balance sheets for future funding of Eversource's equity method investments, as we cannot make reasonable estimates of the periods or the investment contributions.\nFor further information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, see Note 7, \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" Note 8, \"Short-Term Debt,\" Note 9, \"Long-Term Debt,\" Note 10, \"Rate Reduction Bonds and Variable Interest Entities,\" Note 11A, \"Employee Benefits - Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension,\" Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" and Note 14, \"Leases,\" to the financial statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - EVERSOURCE ENERGY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items in the statements of income for Eversource for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nOperating Revenues\nSales Volumes: A summary of our retail electric GWh sales volumes, our firm natural gas MMcf sales volumes, and our water MG sales volumes, and percentage changes, is as follows:\n(1) Special contracts are unique to Yankee Gas natural gas distribution customers who take service under such an arrangement and generally specify the amount of distribution revenue to be paid to Yankee Gas regardless of the customers' usage.\n(2) The 2020 firm natural gas sales volumes include the addition of EGMA beginning October 9, 2020.\nWeather, fluctuations in energy supply costs, conservation measures (including utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs), and economic conditions affect customer energy usage and water consumption. Industrial sales volumes are less sensitive to temperature variations than residential and commercial sales volumes. In our service territories, weather impacts both electric and water sales volumes during the summer and both electric and natural gas sales volumes during the winter; however, natural gas sales volumes are more sensitive to temperature variations than electric sales volumes. Customer heating or cooling usage may not directly correlate with historical levels or with the level of degree-days that occur.\nFluctuations in retail electric sales volumes at PSNH impact earnings (\"Traditional\" in the table above). For CL&P, NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas, EGMA, Yankee Gas, and our Connecticut water distribution business, fluctuations in retail sales volumes do not materially impact earnings due to their respective regulatory commission-approved distribution revenue decoupling mechanisms (\"Decoupled\" in the table above). These distribution revenues are decoupled from their customer sales volumes, which breaks the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized.\nOperating Revenues: Operating Revenues by segment increased in 2020, as compared to 2019, as follows:\nElectric and Natural Gas Distribution Revenues:\nBase Distribution Revenues:\n\u2022Base electric distribution revenues increased $97.5 million in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the impact of CL&P's base distribution rate increases effective May 1, 2020 and May 1, 2019, which include recovery of storm costs and certain other items that do not impact earnings, the NSTAR Electric base distribution rate increase effective January 1, 2020, and the impact of the PSNH temporary base distribution rate increase effective July 1, 2019, which includes recovery of storm costs and certain other items that do not impact earnings.\n\u2022The increase in total electric distribution revenues was partially offset by the impact of the December 2020 PSNH settlement agreement driven by the negative impact from the over-refunding of the change in the 2018 federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that was reflected in temporary rates.\n\u2022Base natural gas distribution revenues increased $34.3 million in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to base distribution rate increases at Yankee Gas effective January 1, 2020 and at NSTAR Gas effective November 1, 2020.\nTracked Distribution Revenues: Tracked distribution revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in retail rates through regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore, recovery of these costs has no impact on earnings. However, tracked revenues do include certain incentives earned, return on rate base and on capital tracking mechanisms, and carrying charges that are billed in rates to customers, which do impact earnings. Costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include, among others, energy supply and natural gas supply procurement and other energy-related costs, electric retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, electric restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues (including securitized RRB charges), and additionally for the Massachusetts utilities, pension and PBOP benefits and net metering for distributed generation. Tracked revenues also include wholesale market sales transactions, such as sales of energy and energy-related products into the ISO-NE wholesale electricity market and the sale of RECs to various counterparties.\nTracked distribution revenues increased/(decreased) in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the following:\nThe decrease in energy supply procurement within electric distribution was driven primarily by lower average prices, partially offset by higher average supply-related sales volumes in 2020, as compared to 2019. The increase in the CL&P FMCC regulatory tracking mechanism revenues and the increase in wholesale market sales revenue within electric distribution was due primarily to the new Millstone PPA entered into by CL&P in 2019, as required by regulation. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, CL&P sells the energy purchased from Millstone Nuclear Power Station (Millstone) into the wholesale market and uses the proceeds from the energy sales to offset a portion of the contract costs. The net costs under the contract are recovered from customers in the FMCC rate.\nThe addition of EGMA increased total operating revenues at the natural gas distribution segment by $154.8 million.\nElectric Transmission Revenues: Electric transmission revenues increased $147.1 million in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to a higher transmission rate base as a result of our continued investment in our transmission infrastructure and a higher benefit from the annual billing and cost reconciliation filing with FERC.\nOther Revenues and Eliminations: Other revenues primarily include the revenues of Eversource's service company, most of which are eliminated in consolidation. Eliminations are also primarily related to the Eversource electric transmission revenues that are derived from ISO-NE regional transmission charges to the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH that recover the costs of the wholesale transmission business.\nPurchased Power, Fuel and Transmission expense includes costs associated with purchasing electricity and natural gas on behalf of our customers. These electric and natural gas supply costs are recovered from customers in rates through commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on earnings (tracked costs). Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission expense decreased in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the following:\nThe increase in purchased power expense at the electric distribution business in 2020 as compared to 2019, was driven primarily by the impact of energy purchases from the new Millstone PPA and higher average supply-related sales volumes, partially offset by lower average prices. The decrease in natural gas supply costs at our natural gas distribution business was due primarily to lower average prices and lower average sales volumes, partially offset by the addition of EGMA natural gas supply costs as a result of the CMA asset acquisition of $58.8 million.\nThe decrease in transmission costs in 2020, as compared to 2019, was primarily the result of a decrease in the retail transmission cost deferral, which reflects the actual costs of transmission service compared to estimated amounts billed to customers. This was partially offset by an increase in Local Network Service charges, which reflect the cost of transmission service provided by Eversource over our local transmission network, and an increase in costs billed by ISO-NE that support regional grid investments.\nOperations and Maintenance expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base electric, natural gas and water distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non-tracked costs). Operations and Maintenance expense increased in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the following:\nDepreciation expense increased in 2020, as compared to 2019, due to higher utility plant in service balances, and due to the addition of EGMA utility plant balances as a result of the CMA asset acquisition of $10.9 million.\nAmortization expense includes the deferrals of energy supply, energy-related costs and other costs that are included in certain regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms, and the amortization of certain costs as those costs are collected in rates. These deferrals adjust expense to match the corresponding revenues. Energy supply and energy-related costs are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings. Amortization decreased in 2020, as compared to 2019, due to the deferrals for the under recovery of energy purchases related to the Millstone PPA at CL&P and due to the deferral of other energy supply and energy-related costs.\nEnergy Efficiency Programs expense increased in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the deferral adjustment at CL&P, PSNH and NSTAR Gas, which reflects the actual costs of energy efficiency programs compared to the amounts billed to customers and the timing of the recovery of energy efficiency costs. The increase was also due to the addition of EGMA energy efficiency program costs as a result of the CMA asset acquisition of $14.4 million. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in spending on certain large energy efficiency projects in 2020, compared to 2019 at NSTAR Electric, due to timing. The costs for the majority of the state energy policy initiatives and expanded energy efficiency programs are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.\nTaxes Other Than Income Taxes expense increased in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of higher utility plant balances and higher Connecticut gross earnings taxes at CL&P, and due to the addition of EGMA property taxes as a result of the CMA asset acquisition of $9.7 million. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $21.4 million related to CL&P's remittance of energy efficiency funds to the State of Connecticut. Energy efficiency funds collected from customers after July 1, 2019 are no longer subject to remittance to the State of Connecticut. The increase was also partially offset by a decrease in property tax at NSTAR Gas relating to the resolution of disputed property taxes for prior years.\nImpairment of Northern Pass Transmission reflects an impairment charge of $239.6 million that was recorded in the second quarter of 2019 as a result of the July 19, 2019 New Hampshire Supreme Court decision. The after-tax impact of this impairment charge was $204.4 million.\nInterest Expense increased in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to an increase in interest on long-term debt as a result of new debt issuances ($27.3 million) and higher amortization of debt discounts and premiums, net ($4.6 million), partially offset by a decrease in interest on notes payable ($16.9 million), a decrease in interest expense at NSTAR Gas relating to the resolution of disputed property taxes for prior years ($5.7 million), and an increase in capitalized AFUDC related to debt funds and other capitalized interest ($3.6 million).\nOther Income, Net decreased in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to a decrease in equity in earnings related to Eversource's equity method investments ($28.0 million), the absence in 2020 of the recognition of the equity component of the carrying charges related to PSNH storm costs recorded in interest income in the first quarter of 2019 ($5.2 million) and lower AFUDC related to equity funds ($3.0 million), partially offset by an increase related to pension, SERP and PBOP non-service income components ($13.1 million).\nIncome Tax Expense increased in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($23.5 million), higher state taxes ($12.6 million), by the absence in 2020 of the impairment of NPT ($35.2 million), by a decrease in tax planning benefits ($9.5 million), the sale of Hingham water system ($12.5 million), return to provision adjustments ($3.3 million), and an increase in items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($4.1 million), partially offset by an increase in share-based payment excess tax benefits ($5.1 million), an increase in amortization of EDIT ($11.3 million), and a decrease in valuation allowance ($11.6 million).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS -\nTHE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY\nNSTAR ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY\nPUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items in the statements of income for CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nOperating Revenues\nSales Volumes: A summary of our retail electric GWh sales volumes is as follows:\nFluctuations in retail electric sales volumes at PSNH impact earnings. For CL&P and NSTAR Electric, fluctuations in retail electric sales volumes do not impact earnings due to their respective regulatory commission-approved distribution revenue decoupling mechanisms.\nOperating Revenues: Operating Revenues, which consist of base distribution revenues and tracked revenues further described below, increased $314.9 million at CL&P and $13.2 million at PSNH, and decreased $103.5 million at NSTAR Electric in 2020, as compared to 2019.\nBase Distribution Revenues:\n\u2022CL&P's distribution revenues increased $40.0 million due primarily to the impact of its base distribution rate increases effective May 1, 2020 and May 1, 2019, which include recovery of storm costs and certain other items that do not impact earnings.\n\u2022NSTAR Electric's distribution revenues increased $32.6 million due primarily to the impact of its base distribution rate increase effective January 1, 2020.\n\u2022PSNH's distribution revenues increased $24.9 million due primarily to the impact of its temporary base distribution rate increase effective July 1, 2019, which includes recovery of storm costs and certain other items that do not impact earnings.\n\u2022The increase in PSNH\u2019s total distribution revenues was partially offset by the impact of the December 2020 settlement agreement driven by the negative impact from the over-refunding of the change in the 2018 federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that was reflected in temporary rates.\nTracked Revenues: Tracked distribution revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in retail rates through regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore, recovery of these costs has no impact on earnings. However, tracked revenues do include certain incentives earned, return on rate base and on capital tracking mechanisms, and carrying charges that are billed in rates to customers, which do impact earnings. Costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include, among others, energy supply procurement and other energy-related costs, retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, electric restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues (including securitized RRB charges), and additionally for NSTAR Electric, pension and PBOP benefits and net metering for distributed generation. Tracked revenues also include wholesale market sales transactions, such as sales of energy and energy-related products into the ISO-NE wholesale electricity market and the sale of RECs to various counterparties.\nTracked revenues increased/(decreased) in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the following:\nThe decrease in energy supply procurement at CL&P and PSNH reflects lower average prices, partially offset by higher average supply-related sales volumes in 2020, as compared to 2019. The decrease in energy supply procurement at NSTAR Electric reflects both lower average prices and lower average supply-related sales volumes for 2020, as compared to 2019.\nThe increase in the CL&P FMCC regulatory tracking mechanism revenues and the increase in wholesale market sales revenue was due primarily to the new Millstone PPA entered into by CL&P in 2019, as required by regulation. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, CL&P sells the energy purchased from Millstone into the wholesale market and uses the proceeds from the energy sales to offset a portion of the contract costs. The net costs under the contract are recovered from customers in the FMCC rate.\nTransmission Revenues: Transmission revenues increased $61.7 million at CL&P, $54.2 million at NSTAR Electric and $31.2 million at PSNH in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to a higher transmission rate base as a result of our continued investment in our transmission infrastructure and a higher benefit from the annual billing and cost reconciliation filing with FERC.\nEliminations: Eliminations are primarily related to the Eversource electric transmission revenues that are derived from ISO-NE regional transmission charges to the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH that recover the costs of the wholesale transmission business. The impact of eliminations decreased revenues by $13.1 million at CL&P, $44.0 million at NSTAR Electric and $20.7 million at PSNH in 2020, as compared to 2019.\nPurchased Power and Transmission expense includes costs associated with purchasing electricity on behalf of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH's customers. These energy supply costs are recovered from customers in rates through commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on earnings (tracked costs). Purchased Power and Transmission expense increased/(decreased) in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the following:\nPurchased Power Costs: Included in purchased power costs are the costs associated with providing electric generation service supply to all customers who have not migrated to third party suppliers and the cost of energy purchase contracts, as required by regulation.\n\u2022The increase at CL&P was due primarily to the new Millstone PPA energy purchases and higher average supply-related sales volumes, partially offset by lower average prices.\n\u2022The decrease at NSTAR Electric was due primarily to lower expense related to the procurement of energy supply resulting from lower average prices and lower average supply-related sales volumes.\n\u2022The decrease at PSNH was due primarily to lower expense related to the procurement of energy supply resulting from lower average prices, partially offset by higher average supply-related sales volumes.\nTransmission Costs: Included in transmission costs are charges that recover the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generation facilities to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market.\n\u2022The decrease in transmission costs at CL&P was due primarily to a reduction to the retail transmission cost deferral, which reflects the actual costs of transmission service compared to estimated amounts billed to customers. This was partially offset by an increase in Local Network Service charges, which reflects the cost of transmission service provided by Eversource over our local transmission network, and an increase in costs billed by ISO-NE that support regional grid investments.\n\u2022The increase in transmission costs at PSNH was primarily the result of an increase in Local Network Service charges, an increase in costs billed by ISO-NE that support regional grid investments, and an increase in the retail transmission cost deferral.\nOperations and Maintenance expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non-tracked costs). Operations and Maintenance expense increased in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the following:\nDepreciation expense increased in 2020, as compared to 2019, for CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH due to higher net plant in service balances.\nAmortization of Regulatory Assets, Net expense includes the deferrals of energy supply, energy-related costs and other costs that are included in certain regulatory-approved cost tracking mechanisms, and the amortization of certain costs as those costs are collected in rates. These deferrals adjust expense to match the corresponding revenues. Energy supply and energy-related costs are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net increased at CL&P and decreased at NSTAR Electric and PSNH in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the deferrals of energy supply and energy-related costs, which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and related rate changes to recover these costs.\nEnergy Efficiency Programs expense includes costs of various state energy policy initiatives and expanded energy efficiency programs that are recovered from customers in rates, most of which have no impact on earnings. Energy Efficiency Programs expense increased/decreased in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the following:\n\u2022The increase at CL&P and PSNH was due to the deferral adjustment, which reflects actual costs of energy efficiency programs compared to the estimated amounts billed to customers, and the timing of the recovery of energy efficiency costs.\n\u2022The decrease at NSTAR Electric was due to the timing of spending on certain large energy efficiency projects in 2020, as compared to 2019.\nTaxes Other Than Income Taxes increased in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the following:\n\u2022The increase at CL&P was related to higher property taxes as a result of a higher utility plant balance, higher gross earnings taxes, and the absence in 2020 of a use tax refund received in 2019, partially offset by a decrease of $21.4 million relating to the remittance of energy efficiency funds to the State of Connecticut. Energy efficiency funds collected from customers after July 1, 2019 are no longer subject to remittance to the State of Connecticut.\n\u2022The increases at NSTAR Electric and PSNH were due to higher property taxes as a result of higher utility plant balances offset against some favorable property tax resolutions with a number of communities.\nInterest Expense increased/decreased in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the following:\n\u2022The increase at CL&P was due to higher interest on long-term debt ($6.6 million), partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on regulatory deferrals ($2.0 million), a decrease in interest on short-term notes payable ($1.2 million), and lower amortization of debt discounts and premiums, net ($0.9 million).\n\u2022The increase at NSTAR Electric was due to higher interest on long-term debt ($12.9 million), an increase in interest expense on regulatory deferrals ($7.4 million), and a decrease in capitalized AFUDC related to debt funds ($1.4 million), partially offset by a decrease in interest on short-term notes payable ($3.6 million).\n\u2022The decrease at PSNH was due to a decrease in interest expense on regulatory deferrals ($2.3 million) and a decrease in RRB interest expense ($1.4 million), partially offset by higher amortization of debt discounts and premiums, net ($0.8 million) and a decrease in capitalized AFUDC related to debt funds ($0.6 million).\nOther Income, Net increased/decreased in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the following:\n\u2022The increase at CL&P was due to an increase related to pension, SERP and PBOP non-service income components ($3.3 million), an increase in AFUDC related to equity funds ($0.6 million), and higher interest income ($0.5 million), partially offset by a decrease in investment income ($1.2 million).\n\u2022The increase at NSTAR Electric was due primarily to an increase related to pension, SERP and PBOP non-service income components ($5.8 million) and an increase in AFUDC related to equity funds ($1.7 million).\n\u2022The decrease at PSNH was due primarily to lower interest income ($8.1 million), which includes the absence in 2020 of the recognition of the equity component of the carrying charges related to storm costs recorded in interest income in 2019 ($5.2 million), partially offset by an increase related to pension, SERP and PBOP non-service income components ($2.1 million) and an increase in AFUDC related to equity funds ($0.8 million).\nIncome Tax Expense increased/decreased in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the following:\n\u2022The increase at CL&P was due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($12.6 million), higher state taxes ($2.8 million), and return to provision adjustments ($1.2 million), partially offset by items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($0.5 million), an increase in share-based payment excess tax benefits ($1.8 million), and a decrease in a valuation allowance ($1.6 million).\n\u2022The increase at NSTAR Electric was due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($3.9 million), higher state taxes ($0.7 million), a decrease in amortization of EDIT ($2.5 million), and return to provision adjustments ($0.5 million), partially offset by items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($0.3 million), and an increase in share-based payment excess tax benefits ($1.8 million).\n\u2022The decrease at PSNH was due primarily to lower state taxes ($2.0 million), an increase in amortization of EDIT ($11.4 million), and an increase in share-based payment excess tax benefits ($0.6 million), partially offset by higher pre-tax earnings ($0.6 million), return to provision adjustments ($1.7 million), and items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($2.4 million).\nEARNINGS SUMMARY\nCL&P's earnings increased $47.0 million in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the base distribution rate increases effective May 1, 2020 and May 1, 2019, an increase in transmission earnings driven by a higher transmission rate base, and higher earnings from its capital tracker mechanism due to increased electric system improvements. The earnings increase was partially offset by higher depreciation expense, higher property tax expense, and higher interest expense.\nNSTAR Electric's earnings increased $13.0 million in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the base distribution rate increase effective January 1, 2020, an increase in transmission earnings driven by a higher transmission rate base, and higher energy efficiency incentives earned. The earnings increase was partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense, higher interest expense, higher depreciation expense, and higher property tax expense.\nPSNH's earnings increased $13.3 million in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to the temporary base distribution rate increase effective July 1, 2019, an increase in transmission earnings driven by a higher transmission rate base, and the impact of the PSNH rate settlement agreement approved in December 2020 that was due primarily to the reconciliation of permanent rates back to the temporary rate period. The settlement agreement primarily resulted in a benefit to income tax expense for the reduction of the EDIT regulatory liability, partially offset by a reduction in revenues driven by the negative impact from the over-refunding of the change in the 2018 federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that was reflected in temporary rates. The earnings increase was partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense, higher property tax expense, and the absence of the 2019 recognition of carrying charges on its 2013 through 2016 storm costs approved for recovery.\nLIQUIDITY\nCash Flows: CL&P had cash flows provided by operating activities of $397.1 million in 2020, as compared to $726.4 million in 2019. The decrease in operating cash flows was due primarily to cash payments made in 2020 for storm restoration costs of approximately $180 million related to Tropical Storm Isaias and the timing of cash payments made on our accounts payable. In addition, the timing of collections for regulatory tracking mechanisms, which includes the impact of the CL&P temporary rate suspension, the timing of cash collections on our accounts receivable, and the timing of other working capital items contributed to the decrease in operating cash flows. Partially offsetting these unfavorable impacts was lower income tax payments made of $69.7 million in 2020, as compared to 2019.\nNSTAR Electric had cash flows provided by operating activities of $525.8 million in 2020, as compared to $698.3 million in 2019. The decrease in operating cash flows was due primarily to the timing of collections for regulatory tracking mechanisms primarily related to transmission costs, the timing of cash collections on our accounts receivable, a $32.8 million increase in income tax payments made in 2020, as compared to 2019, and the timing of other working capital items. Partially offsetting these unfavorable impacts were the timing of cash payments on our accounts payable and a $5.7 million decrease in Pension and PBOP contributions made in 2020, as compared to 2019.\nPSNH had cash flows provided by operating activities of $218.7 million in 2020, as compared to $274.4 million in 2019. The decrease in operating cash flows was due primarily to the timing of cash collections on our accounts receivable and an increase in income tax payments made of $30.8 million in 2020, as compared to 2019. Also contributing to the decrease were the timing of collections for regulatory tracking mechanisms and an increase of $4.1 million in Pension contributions made in 2020, as compared to 2019. Partially offsetting these unfavorable impacts was the timing of cash payments on our accounts payable.\nReceivables, net of reserves, on the balance sheets have increased $58.3 million at CL&P, $56.3 million at NSTAR Electric, and $20.0 million at PSNH in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to an increase in delinquent receivables from customers attributable to the moratorium on disconnections and the economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor further information on CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's and PSNH's liquidity and capital resources, see \"Liquidity\" and \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures\" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nMarket Risk Information\nCommodity Price Risk Management: Our regulated companies enter into energy contracts to serve our customers, and the economic impacts of those contracts are passed on to our customers. Accordingly, the regulated companies have no exposure to loss of future earnings or fair values due to these market risk-sensitive instruments. Eversource's Energy Supply Risk Committee, comprised of senior officers, reviews and approves all large-scale energy related transactions entered into by its regulated companies.\nOther Risk Management Activities\nWe have an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program for identifying the principal risks of the Company. Our ERM program involves the application of a well-defined, enterprise-wide methodology designed to allow our Risk Committee, comprised of our senior officers of the Company, to identify, categorize, prioritize, and mitigate the principal risks to the Company. The ERM program is integrated with other assurance functions throughout the Company including Compliance, Auditing, and Insurance to ensure appropriate coverage of risks that could impact the Company. In addition to known risks, ERM identifies emerging risks to the Company, through participation in industry groups, discussions with management and in consultation with outside advisers. Our management then analyzes risks to determine materiality, likelihood and impact, and develops mitigation strategies. Management broadly considers our business model, the utility industry, the global economy, climate change, sustainability and the current environment to identify risks. The Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees is responsible for oversight of the Company's ERM program and enterprise-wide risks as well as specific risks associated with insurance, credit, financing, investments, pensions and overall system security including cyber security. The findings of the ERM process are periodically discussed with the Finance Committee of our Board of Trustees, as well as with other Board Committees or the full Board of Trustees, as appropriate, including reporting on how these issues are being measured and managed. However, there can be no assurances that the ERM process will identify or manage every risk or event that could impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nInterest Rate Risk Management: We manage our interest rate risk exposure in accordance with our written policies and procedures by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate long-term debt. As of December 31, 2020, all of our long-term debt except for $11.7 million of fees and interest due for CYAPC's spent nuclear fuel disposal costs, was at a fixed interest rate.\nCredit Risk Management: Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that we would incur as a result of non-performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of our contractual obligations. We serve a wide variety of customers and transact with suppliers that include IPPs, industrial companies, natural gas and electric utilities, oil and natural gas producers, financial institutions, and other energy marketers. Margin accounts exist within this diverse group, and we realize interest receipts and payments related to balances outstanding in these margin accounts. This wide customer and supplier mix generates a need for a variety of contractual structures, products and terms that, in turn, require us to manage the portfolio of market risk inherent in those transactions in a manner consistent with the parameters established by our risk management process.\nOur regulated companies are subject to credit risk from certain long-term or high-volume supply contracts with energy marketing companies. Our regulated companies manage the credit risk with these counterparties in accordance with established credit risk practices and monitor contracting risks, including credit risk. As of December 31, 2020, our regulated companies held collateral (letters of credit or cash) of $10.0 million from counterparties related to our standard service contracts. As of December 31, 2020, Eversource had $34.6 million of cash posted with ISO-NE related to energy transactions.\nFor further information on cash collateral deposited and posted with counterparties, see Note 1O, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Supplemental Cash Flow Information,\" to the financial statements.\nIf the respective unsecured debt ratings of Eversource or its subsidiaries were reduced to below investment grade by either Moody's or S&P, certain of Eversource's contracts would require additional collateral in the form of cash to be provided to counterparties and independent system operators. Eversource would have been and remains able to provide that collateral.",

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nEversource\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nCL&P\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nFinancial Statements\nNSTAR Electric\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nPSNH\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nEversource Energy\nManagement is responsible for the preparation, integrity, and fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Eversource Energy and subsidiaries (Eversource or the Company) and of other sections of this annual report. Eversource's internal controls over financial reporting were audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. The Company's internal control framework and processes have been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. There are inherent limitations of internal controls over financial reporting that could allow material misstatements due to error or fraud to occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees during the normal course of business. Additionally, internal controls over financial reporting may become inadequate in the future due to changes in the business environment.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, Eversource conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation under the framework in COSO, management concluded that internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2020.\nManagement has excluded from our assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting the internal\ncontrols of Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts (EGMA). On October 9, 2020, Eversource completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities that comprised NiSource\u2019s natural gas distribution business in Massachusetts, which was previously doing business as Columbia Gas of Massachusetts (CMA). The natural gas distribution assets acquired from CMA were assigned to EGMA, and are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, constituting 3.4 percent and 5.8 percent of total and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2020, and 1.7 percent and 1.2 percent of revenues and net income attributable to common shareholders, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFebruary 17, 2021\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Eversource Energy:\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Eversource Energy and subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nAs described in the Management\u2019s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts (previously doing business as Columbia Gas of Massachusetts), which was acquired on October 9, 2020, and whose financial statements constitute 3.4% and 5.8% of total and net assets, respectively, 1.7% of revenues, and 1.2% of net income attributable to common shareholders of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated February 17, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nHartford, Connecticut\nFebruary 17, 2021\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Eversource Energy:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Eversource Energy and subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common shareholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 of Part IV (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 17, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Accounting - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company\u2019s utility companies are subject to rate regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and by their respective state public utility authorities in Connecticut, Massachusetts, or New Hampshire (the \u201cCommissions\u201d). The rate regulation by these Commissions is based on cost recovery. The regulated companies\u2019 financial statements reflect the effects of the rate-making process. The rates charged to the customers of the Company\u2019s regulated companies are designed to collect each company\u2019s cost to provide service, plus a return on investment.\nThe application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory assets are amortized as the incurred costs are recovered through customer rates. In some cases, the Company records regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission. The Company must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. The Company bases its conclusion on certain factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory precedent. Regulatory liabilities represent either revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customers.\nThe Company uses judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities; however, regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs, and those conclusions could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements. Management believes it is probable that each of the regulated companies will recover its respective investment in long-lived assets, including regulatory assets. If management were to determine that it could no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises to any of the regulated companies\u2019 operations, or if management could not conclude it is probable that costs would be recovered from customers in future rates, the costs would be charged to net income in the period in which the determination is made.\nAccounting for the economics of rate-regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as regulated property, plant, and equipment, regulatory assets and liabilities, operating revenues and depreciation expense. While management has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve full recovery of such costs or full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. We identified the impact of rate-regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the probability of recovery in future rates of incurred costs and a refund to customers. Given that management\u2019s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments requires specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of management\u2019s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of management\u2019s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates, a refund, or a future reduction in rates.\n\u2022 We evaluated the Company\u2019s disclosures related to the applicability and impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments disclosed in the financial statements.\n\u2022 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company and other public utilities, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future refund or reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions\u2019 treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management\u2019s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n\u2022 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company\u2019s filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors that may impact the Company\u2019s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management\u2019s assertions.\n\u2022 We made inquiries of management, including legal counsel, and obtained the regulatory orders and analysis from management that support the probability of recovery, refund, or future reductions in rates for regulatory assets and liabilities to assess management\u2019s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nHartford, Connecticut\nFebruary 17, 2021\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2002.\nEVERSOURCE ENERGY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nEVERSOURCE ENERGY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nEVERSOURCE ENERGY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nEVERSOURCE ENERGY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nThe Connecticut Light and Power Company\nManagement is responsible for the preparation, integrity, and fair presentation of the accompanying financial statements of The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P or the Company) and of other sections of this annual report.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. The Company's internal control framework and processes have been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. There are inherent limitations of internal controls over financial reporting that could allow material misstatements due to error or fraud to occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees during the normal course of business. Additionally, internal controls over financial reporting may become inadequate in the future due to changes in the business environment.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, CL&P conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation under the framework in COSO, management concluded that internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2020.\nFebruary 17, 2021\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholder of The Connecticut Light and Power Company:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of The Connecticut Light and Power Company (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder\u2019s equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 of Part IV (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d).

The rate regulation by these Commissions is based on cost recovery. The Company\u2019s financial statements reflect the effects of the rate-making process. The rates charged to the customers are designed to collect the Company\u2019s cost to provide service, plus a return on investment.\nThe application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory assets are amortized as the incurred costs are recovered through customer rates. In some cases, the Company records regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission. The Company must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. The Company bases its conclusion on certain factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory precedent. Regulatory liabilities represent either revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customers.\nThe Company uses judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities; however, regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs, and those conclusions could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements. Management believes it is probable that the Company will recover its investment in long-lived assets, including regulatory assets. If management were to determine that it could no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises to the Company\u2019s operations, or if management could not conclude it is probable that costs would be recovered from customers in future rates, the costs would be charged to net income in the period in which the determination is made.\nAccounting for the economics of rate-regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as regulated property, plant, and equipment, regulatory assets and liabilities, operating revenues and depreciation expense. While management has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve full recovery of such costs or full recovery of all amounts invested in the Company and a reasonable return on that investment. We identified the impact of rate-regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the probability of recovery in future rates of incurred costs and a refund to customers. Given that management\u2019s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments requires specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of management\u2019s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of management\u2019s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates, a refund, or a future reduction in rates.\n\u2022 We evaluated the Company\u2019s disclosures related to the applicability and impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments disclosed in the financial statements.\n\u2022 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company and other public utilities, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future refund or reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions\u2019 treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management\u2019s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n\u2022 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company\u2019s filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors that may impact the Company\u2019s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management\u2019s assertions.\n\u2022 We made inquiries of management, including legal counsel, and obtained the regulatory orders and analysis from management that support the probability of recovery, refund, or future reductions in rates for regulatory assets and liabilities to assess management\u2019s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nHartford, Connecticut\nFebruary 17, 2021\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2002.\nPUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nPUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nPUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMMON STOCKHOLDER'S EQUITY\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nPUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nEVERSOURCE ENERGY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY\nNSTAR ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY\nPUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCOMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRefer to the Glossary of Terms included in this combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for abbreviations and acronyms used throughout the combined notes to the financial statements.\n1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nA. About Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH\nEversource Energy is a public utility holding company primarily engaged, through its wholly-owned regulated utility subsidiaries, in the energy delivery business. Eversource Energy's wholly-owned regulated utility subsidiaries consist of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH (electric utilities), Yankee Gas, NSTAR Gas and Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts (EGMA) (natural gas utilities) and Aquarion (water utilities). Eversource provides energy delivery and/or water service to approximately 4.3 million electric, natural gas and water customers through nine regulated utilities in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.\nOn October 9, 2020, Eversource completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities that comprised NiSource\u2019s natural gas distribution business in Massachusetts, which was previously doing business as Columbia Gas of Massachusetts (CMA). The natural gas distribution assets acquired from CMA were assigned to EGMA, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Eversource formed in 2020. The LNG assets acquired from CMA were assigned to Hopkinton LNG Corp. The cash purchase price was $1.1 billion, plus a target working capital amount of $69.6 million, which is subject to adjustment to reflect actual working capital as of the closing date that has not yet been finalized. Eversource's consolidated financial information includes the results of EGMA beginning from the date of acquisition on October 9, 2020. See Note 24, \"Acquisition of Assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts,\" for further information.\nEversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH are reporting companies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Eversource Energy is a public utility holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. Arrangements among the regulated electric companies and other Eversource companies, outside agencies and other utilities covering interconnections, interchange of electric power and sales of utility property are subject to regulation by the FERC. Eversource's regulated companies are subject to regulation of rates, accounting and other matters by the FERC and/or applicable state regulatory commissions (the PURA for CL&P, Yankee Gas and Aquarion, the DPU for NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Aquarion, and the NHPUC for PSNH and Aquarion).\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH furnish franchised retail electric service in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. NSTAR Gas and EGMA are engaged in the distribution and sale of natural gas to customers within Massachusetts and Yankee Gas is engaged in the distribution and sale of natural gas to customers within Connecticut. Aquarion is engaged in the collection, treatment and distribution of water in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH's results include the operations of their respective distribution and transmission businesses. The distribution business also includes the results of NSTAR Electric's solar power facilities and PSNH's generation facilities prior to sale in 2018. PSNH completed the sales of all its thermal and hydroelectric generation assets in 2018.\nEversource Service, Eversource's service company, and several wholly-owned real estate subsidiaries of Eversource, provide support services to Eversource, including its regulated companies.\nB. Basis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Eversource, NSTAR Electric and PSNH include the accounts of each of their respective subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Eversource, NSTAR Electric and PSNH and the financial statements of CL&P are herein collectively referred to as the \"financial statements.\"\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nEversource consolidates the operations of CYAPC and YAEC, both of which are inactive regional nuclear power companies engaged in the long-term storage of their spent nuclear fuel. Eversource consolidates CYAPC and YAEC because CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's and PSNH's combined ownership and voting interests in each of these entities is greater than 50 percent. Intercompany transactions between CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and the CYAPC and YAEC companies have been eliminated in consolidation of the Eversource financial statements.\nEversource holds several equity ownership interests that are not consolidated and are accounted for under the equity method.\nIn accordance with accounting guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, the Preferred Stock of CL&P and the Preferred Stock of NSTAR Electric, which are not owned by Eversource or its consolidated subsidiaries and are not subject to mandatory redemption, have been presented as noncontrolling interests in the financial statements of Eversource. The Preferred Stock of CL&P and the Preferred Stock of NSTAR Electric are considered to be temporary equity and have been classified between liabilities and permanent shareholders' equity on the balance sheets of Eversource, CL&P and NSTAR Electric due to a provision in the preferred stock agreements of both CL&P and NSTAR Electric that grant preferred stockholders the right to elect a majority of the CL&P and NSTAR Electric Boards of Directors, respectively, should certain conditions exist, such as if preferred dividends are in arrears for a specified amount of time. The Net Income reported in the statements of income and cash flows represents net income prior to apportionment to noncontrolling interests, which is represented by dividends on preferred stock of CL&P and NSTAR Electric.\nEversource's utility subsidiaries' electric, natural gas and water distribution and transmission businesses are subject to rate-regulation that is based on cost recovery and meets the criteria for application of accounting guidance for entities with rate-regulated operations, which considers the effect of regulation on the differences in the timing of the recognition of certain revenues and expenses from those of other businesses and industries. See Note 2, \"Regulatory Accounting,\" for further information.\nCOVID-19 has adversely affected workers and the economy and caused volatility in the financial markets. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the unprecedented and evolving situation, we continue to closely monitor how COVID-19 related developments affect Eversource. Based on available information, we have not experienced significant impacts directly related to the pandemic that have adversely affected our current operations or results of operations. The extent of the impact to us in the future will vary and depend in large part on the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic and the timing and extent of COVID-19 relief legislation, and the resulting impact on economic, health care and capital market conditions. The future impact will also depend on the outcome of planned proceedings before our state regulatory commissions to recover our incremental costs associated with COVID-19.\nWe believe that we have in place, or are developing, successful mechanisms with our state regulatory commissions that allow, or will allow, us to recover our incremental costs associated with COVID-19, which include uncollectible customer receivable expenses, while balancing the impact on our customers\u2019 bills and our operating cash flows. See Note 1F, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts,\" for discussion of our evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2020 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAn extended economic slowdown has resulted in lower demand for electricity, natural gas and/or water by our commercial and industrial customers. However, fluctuations in retail sales volumes for CL&P, NSTAR Electric, Yankee Gas, NSTAR Gas, EGMA, and our Connecticut water distribution business do not materially impact earnings due to their respective state regulatory commission-approved distribution revenue decoupling mechanisms.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not identify indicators or triggering events for impairments to our goodwill, long-lived assets, available-for-sale debt securities, or equity method investment carrying values.\nCertain reclassifications of prior year data were made in the accompanying financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Eversource's carrying amount of goodwill was approximately $4.45 billion and $4.43 billion, respectively. Eversource performs an assessment for possible impairment of its goodwill at least annually. Eversource completed its annual goodwill impairment assessment for each of its reporting units as of October 1, 2020 and determined that no impairment exists. See Note 25, \"Goodwill,\" for further information.\nC. Accounting Standards\nAccounting Standards Issued but Not Yet Effective: In December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which eliminates certain exceptions to the general principles of current income tax guidance in ASC 740 and simplifies and improves consistency in application of that income tax guidance through clarifications of and amendments to ASC 740. The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2021. The ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH.\nAccounting Standards Recently Adopted: On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), which provides a model for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of current expected losses, requiring immediate recognition of credit losses expected over the life of a financial instrument. The Company determined the impacts of this standard on the allowance for credit losses on its financial instruments, primarily accounts receivable. As of January 1, 2020, the Company recorded increases to the allowance for uncollectible accounts for late fees and other receivable amounts of $1.6 million, $0.9 million, $0.2 million and $0.3 million at Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, respectively. The impact to retained earnings, net of tax, was $1.5 million, $0.9 million, $0.2 million and $0.3 million at Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, respectively.\nThe Company also adjusted the allowance for uncollectible amounts of hardship receivables and other low-income assistance programs, which are ultimately collectible in rates at specified points in time under approved regulatory mechanisms. The impact on the allowance, which was offset in other long-term assets on the balance sheets, was an increase of $22.2 million and $21.3 million at Eversource and CL&P, respectively, and a decrease of $1.5 million at NSTAR Electric as of January 1, 2020. See Note 1F, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies - Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts,\u201d for further information.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment as of January 1, 2020. The ASU simplified the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing a complex step in the goodwill impairment test. Under the guidance, goodwill impairment is measured as the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its fair value. The ASU did not have an impact on the financial statements of Eversource.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) - Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. The ASU aligned the requirements for capitalizing costs incurred to implement a cloud computing arrangement with existing internal-use software guidance. The prospective implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on the financial statements of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric or PSNH for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company prospectively adopted ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The ASU modified fair value disclosure requirements. The standard includes new disclosure requirements for Level 3 unobservable inputs and eliminated the requirement to disclose certain information relating to transfers between levels. The modified disclosures are included in Note 1I, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies - Fair Value Measurements,\u201d and Note 4, \u201cDerivative Instruments.\u201d\nThe Company adopted ASU 2018-14, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General, Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans as of January 1, 2020. The guidance eliminated certain disclosures about defined benefit plans, added new disclosures, and clarified other requirements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020. Adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our annual financial statement disclosures. The modified disclosures are included in Note 11A, \u201cEmployee Benefits - Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension.\u201d\nD. Impairment of Northern Pass Transmission\nNorthern Pass was Eversource's planned 1,090 MW HVDC transmission line that would have interconnected from the Qu\u00e9bec-New Hampshire border to Franklin, New Hampshire and an associated alternating current radial transmission line between Franklin and Deerfield, New Hampshire. As a result of a final decision received on July 19, 2019 from the New Hampshire Supreme Court, whereby the court denied Northern Pass\u2019 appeal and affirmed the NHSEC\u2019s denial of Northern Pass\u2019 siting application on NPT, Eversource concluded that construction of NPT was no longer probable and that there was no constructive path forward for the project. In 2019, Eversource terminated the project and permanently abandoned any further development. As a result, substantially all of the capitalized project costs, which totaled $318 million, certain of which were subject to cost reimbursement agreements, were impaired.\nBased on the conclusion that the construction of Northern Pass was no longer probable, Eversource recorded an impairment charge in 2019 for all of the project costs associated with Northern Pass, which were primarily engineering design, siting, permitting and legal costs, along with appropriate allowances for funds used during construction, and recognized a receivable for certain cost reimbursement agreements. Additionally, Eversource recorded an impairment charge associated with the land acquired to construct Northern Pass in order to recognize the land at its estimated fair value based on assessed values and transaction costs. In total, this resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $239.6 million within Operating Income on the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2019 and was reflected in the Electric Transmission segment. The after-tax impact of the impairment charge was $204.4 million, or $0.64 per share, after giving effect to the estimated fair value of the related land, reimbursement agreements, and the impact of expected income tax benefits associated with the impairment charge. As a result of the decision to terminate the NPT project and permanently abandon any further development, Eversource does not expect any future cash expenditures associated with this project.\nE. Cash\nCash includes cash on hand. At the end of each reporting period, any overdraft amounts are reclassified from Cash to Accounts Payable on the balance sheets.\nF. Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts\nReceivables, Net on the balance sheets primarily includes trade receivables from retail customers and customers related to wholesale transmission contracts, wholesale market sales, sales of RECs and property rentals. Receivables, Net also includes customer receivables for the purchase of electricity from a competitive third party supplier, the current portion of customer energy efficiency loans, property damage receivables and other miscellaneous receivables. There is no material concentration of receivables. Receivables are recorded at amortized cost, net of a credit loss provision (or allowance for uncollectible accounts).\nReceivables are presented net of expected credit losses at estimated net realizable value by maintaining an allowance for uncollectible accounts. Effective January 1, 2020, the current expected credit loss (CECL) model was applied to receivables for purposes of calculating the allowance for uncollectible accounts. This model is based on expected losses and results in the recognition of estimated expected credit losses, including uncollectible amounts for both billed and unbilled revenues, over the life of the receivable at the time a receivable is recorded.\nReceivables, net of reserves, increased $206.5 million ($58.3 million at CL&P, $56.3 million at NSTAR Electric, and $20.0 million at PSNH) in 2020, as compared to 2019, due primarily to an increase in delinquent receivables from customers attributable to the moratorium on disconnections and the economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Receivables, net of reserves, also increased due to the addition of EGMA of $65.8 million as of December 31, 2020.\nThe allowance for uncollectible accounts is determined based upon a variety of judgments and factors, including the application of an estimated uncollectible percentage to each receivable aging category. Factors in determining credit loss include historical collection, write-off experience, and management's assessment of collectability from customers, including current conditions, reasonable forecasts, and expectations of future collectability and collection efforts. Management continuously assesses the collectability of receivables and adjusts estimates based on actual experience and future expectations based on economic indicators, collection efforts and other factors. Management also monitors the aging analysis of receivables to determine if there are changes in the collections of accounts receivable. Receivable balances are written off against the allowance for uncollectible accounts when the customer accounts are no longer in service and these balances are deemed to be uncollectible.\nAs of December 31, 2020, management evaluated the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related economic downturn. This evaluation included an analysis of collection and customer payment trends, economic conditions, delinquency statistics, aging-based quantitative assessments, the impact on residential customer bills because of energy usage and change in rates, flexible payment plans and financial hardship arrearage management programs being offered to customers, and COVID-19 developments, including any potential federal governmental pandemic relief programs and the expansion of unemployment benefit initiatives, which help to mitigate the potential for increasing customer account delinquencies. Additionally, management considered past economic declines and corresponding uncollectible reserves as part of the current assessment. This evaluation has shown that our operating companies have experienced an increase in aged receivables and some lower cash collections from customers because of the moratorium on disconnections and the economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Based upon the evaluation performed, for the year ended December 31, 2020, management increased the allowance for uncollectible accounts for amounts incurred as a result of COVID-19 by $31.5 million for Eversource ($2.8 million for CL&P, $11.0 million for NSTAR Electric, $2.3 million for PSNH and $15.4 million at our natural gas businesses). These COVID-19 related uncollectible amounts were deferred either as incremental regulatory costs or deferred through existing regulatory tracking mechanisms that recover uncollectible energy supply costs, as management believes it is probable that these costs will ultimately be recovered from customers in rates.\nManagement concluded that the reserve balance as of December 31, 2020 adequately reflected the collection risk and net realizable value for Eversource\u2019s receivables. Management will continue to evaluate the adequacy of the uncollectible allowance in future reporting periods based on an ongoing assessment of accounts receivable collections, delinquency statistics, and analysis of aging-based quantitative assessments.\nThe PURA allows CL&P and Yankee Gas to accelerate the recovery of accounts receivable balances attributable to qualified customers under financial or medical duress (uncollectible hardship accounts receivable) outstanding for greater than 180 days and 90 days, respectively. The DPU allows NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas to recover in rates, amounts associated with certain uncollectible hardship accounts receivable. Management also believes that uncollectible hardship accounts receivable at EGMA will be recoverable in future rates. These uncollectible hardship customer account balances are included in Regulatory Assets or Other Long-Term Assets on the balance sheets. Hardship customers are protected from shut-off in certain circumstances, and historical collection experience has reflected a higher default risk as compared to the rest of the receivable population. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, management aligned the allowance for uncollectible hardship accounts across all regulatory jurisdictions, using a higher credit risk profile for this pool of trade receivables as compared to non-hardship receivables. Implementation impacts of the accounting standard on the allowance for uncollectible hardship accounts are reflected in the rollforward of the uncollectible allowance in the table below. The allowance for uncollectible hardship accounts is included in the total uncollectible allowance balance.\nThe total allowance for uncollectible accounts is included in Receivables, Net on the balance sheets. The activity in the allowance for uncollectible accounts by portfolio segment is as follows:\n(1) Uncollectible expense associated with customer and other accounts receivable is included in Operations and Maintenance expense on the statements of income. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, uncollectible expense included in Operations and Maintenance Expense was $63.4 million and $61.3 million for Eversource, $15.9 million and $15.8 million for CL&P, $25.1 million and $22.3 million for NSTAR Electric and $6.7 million and $6.4 million for PSNH, respectively.\n(2) The current period provision for expected credit losses is deferred as a regulatory cost on the balance sheets, as this amount is ultimately recovered in rates. Amounts include uncollectible costs for hardship accounts and other customer receivables, including uncollectible amounts related to COVID-19.\nG. Transfer of Energy Efficiency Loans\nCL&P has transferred a portion of its energy efficiency customer loan portfolio to outside lenders in order to make additional loans to customers. CL&P remains the servicer of the loans and will transmit customer payments to the lenders, with a maximum amount outstanding under this program of $55 million. The amounts of the loans are included in Accounts Receivable, Net and Other Long-Term Assets, and are offset by Other Current Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities on CL&P\u2019s balance sheet. The current and long-term portions totaled $12.9 million and $9.5 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020, and $16.5 million and $18.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.\nH. Fuel, Materials, Supplies and REC Inventory\nFuel, Materials, Supplies and REC Inventory include natural gas inventory, materials and supplies purchased primarily for construction or operation and maintenance purposes, and RECs. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. RECs are purchased from suppliers of renewable sources of generation and are used to meet state mandated Renewable Portfolio Standards requirements. The carrying amounts of fuel, materials and supplies, and RECs, which are included in Current Assets on the balance sheets, were as follows:\nI. Fair Value Measurements\nFair value measurement guidance is applied to derivative contracts that are not elected or designated as \"normal purchases\" or \"normal sales\" (normal) and to the marketable securities held in trusts. Fair value measurement guidance is also applied to valuations of the investments used to calculate the funded status of pension and PBOP plans, the nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets such as goodwill, long-lived assets, equity method investments, and AROs, and in the valuation of the acquisition of CMA in 2020. The fair value measurement guidance was also applied in estimating the fair value of preferred stock, long-term debt and RRBs.\nFair Value Hierarchy: In measuring fair value, Eversource uses observable market data when available in order to minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs used in fair value measurements are categorized into three fair value hierarchy levels for disclosure purposes. The entire fair value measurement is categorized based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Eversource evaluates the classification of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a quarterly basis. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\nLevel 1 - Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2 - Inputs are quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable.\nLevel 3 - Quoted market prices are not available. Fair value is derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or assumptions are unobservable. Where possible, valuation techniques incorporate observable market inputs that can be validated to external sources such as industry exchanges, including prices of energy and energy-related products.\nUncategorized - Investments that are measured at net asset value are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.\nDetermination of Fair Value: The valuation techniques and inputs used in Eversource's fair value measurements are described in Note 4, \"Derivative Instruments,\" Note 5, \"Marketable Securities,\" Note 6, \"Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates,\" Note 7, \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" Note 11A, \"Employee Benefits - Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension,\" Note 15, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" Note 24, \"Acquisition of Assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts,\" and Note 25, \u201cGoodwill,\u201d to the financial statements.\nJ. Derivative Accounting\nMany of the electric and natural gas companies' contracts for the purchase and sale of energy or energy-related products are derivatives. The accounting treatment for energy contracts entered into varies and depends on the intended use of the particular contract and on whether or not the contract is a derivative.\nThe application of derivative accounting is complex and requires management judgment in the following respects: identification of derivatives and embedded derivatives, election and designation of a contract as normal, and determination of the fair value of derivative contracts. All of these judgments can have a significant impact on the financial statements. The judgment applied in the election of a contract as normal (and resulting accrual accounting) includes the conclusion that it is probable at the inception of the contract and throughout its term that it will result in physical delivery of the underlying product and that the quantities will be used or sold by the business in the normal course of business. If facts and circumstances change and management can no longer support this conclusion, then a contract cannot be considered normal, accrual accounting is terminated, and fair value accounting is applied prospectively.\nThe fair value of derivative contracts is based upon the contract terms and conditions and the underlying market price or fair value per unit. When quantities are not specified in the contract, the Company determines whether the contract has a determinable quantity by using amounts referenced in default provisions and other relevant sections of the contract. The fair value of derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are offset and recorded as a net derivative asset or liability on the balance sheets.\nRegulatory assets or regulatory liabilities are recorded to offset the fair values of derivative contracts related to energy and energy-related products, as contract settlements are recovered from, or refunded to, customers in future rates. All changes in the fair value of derivative contracts are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities and do not impact net income.\nFor further information regarding derivative contracts, see Note 4, \"Derivative Instruments,\" to the financial statements.\nK. Operating Expenses\nCosts related to fuel and natural gas included in Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission on the statements of income were as follows:\n(1) PSNH completed the sale of its generation assets in 2018.\nL. Allowance for Funds Used During Construction\nAFUDC represents the cost of borrowed and equity funds used to finance construction and is included in the cost of the electric, natural gas and water companies' utility plant on the balance sheet. The portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds is recorded as a reduction of Interest Expense, and the AFUDC related to equity funds is recorded as Other Income, Net on the statements of income. AFUDC costs are recovered from customers over the service life of the related plant in the form of increased revenue collected as a result of higher depreciation expense.\nThe average AFUDC rate is based on a FERC-prescribed formula using the cost of a company's short-term financings and capitalization (preferred stock, long-term debt and common equity), as appropriate. The average rate is applied to average eligible CWIP amounts to calculate AFUDC.\nAFUDC costs and the weighted-average AFUDC rates were as follows:\nM. Other Income, Net\nThe components of Other Income, Net on the statements of income were as follows:\n(1) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates includes other-than-temporary impairments of $2.8 million related to a write-off of an investment within a renewable energy fund, and $32.9 million of the Access Northeast project investment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018, respectively. See Note 6, \"Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates,\" for further information. Equity in earnings includes $2.4 million of primarily realized gains, and $20.4 million and $17.6 million of pre-tax unrealized gains, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, associated with an equity method investment in a renewable energy fund.\nN. Other Taxes\nEversource's companies that serve customers in Connecticut collect gross receipts taxes levied by the state of Connecticut from their customers. These gross receipts taxes are recorded separately with collections in Operating Revenues and with payments in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes on the statements of income as follows:\nSeparate from above were amounts recorded as Taxes Other Than Income Taxes at CL&P related to the remittance to the State of Connecticut of energy efficiency funds collected from customers of $21.4 million and $46.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Energy efficiency funds collected from customers after July 1, 2019 are no longer subject to remittance to the State of Connecticut. These amounts were recorded separately, with collections in Operating Revenues and with payments in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes on the Eversource and CL&P statements of income.\nAs agents for state and local governments, Eversource's companies that serve customers in Connecticut and Massachusetts collect certain sales taxes that are recorded on a net basis with no impact on the statements of income.\nO. Supplemental Cash Flow Information\nBeginning in 2019, Eversource began issuing treasury shares to satisfy awards under the Company's incentive plans, shares issued under the dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan, and matching contributions under the Eversource 401k Plan. The issuance of treasury shares represents a non-cash transaction, as the treasury shares were used to fulfill Eversource's obligations that require the issuance of common shares.\nThe following table reconciles cash as reported on the balance sheets to the cash and restricted cash balance as reported on the statements of cash flows:\nSpecial Deposits represent cash collections related to the PSNH RRB customer charges that are held in trust, required ISO-NE cash deposits, and CYAPC and YAEC cash balances. Special Deposits are included in Current Assets on the balance sheets. Restricted cash included in Marketable Securities represents money market funds held in trusts to fund certain non-qualified executive benefits and restricted trusts to fund CYAPC and YAEC's spent nuclear fuel storage obligations. Restricted cash included in Other Long-Term Assets includes $41.5 million related to an Energy Relief Fund for energy efficiency and clean energy measures in the Merrimack Valley, and an additional energy efficiency program established under the terms of the EGMA settlement agreement.\nP. Related Parties\nEversource Service, Eversource's service company, provides centralized accounting, administrative, engineering, financial, information technology, legal, operational, planning, purchasing, tax, and other services to Eversource's companies. The Rocky River Realty Company and Properties, Inc., two other Eversource subsidiaries, construct, acquire or lease some of the property and facilities used by Eversource's companies.\nAs of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH had long-term receivables from Eversource Service in the amounts of $25.0 million, $5.5 million and $3.8 million, respectively, which were included in Other Long-Term Assets on the balance sheets. These amounts related to the funding of investments held in trust by Eversource Service in connection with certain postretirement benefits for CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH employees and have been eliminated in consolidation on the Eversource financial statements.\nIncluded in the CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were Accounts Receivable from Affiliated Companies and Accounts Payable to Affiliated Companies relating to transactions between CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH and other subsidiaries that are wholly-owned by Eversource. These amounts have been eliminated in consolidation on the Eversource financial statements.\nThe Eversource Energy Foundation is an independent not-for-profit charitable entity and is not included in the consolidated financial statements of Eversource as the Company does not have title to, and cannot receive contributions back from, the Eversource Energy Foundation's assets. Eversource made contributions to the Eversource Energy Foundation of $6.4 million in 2020 and did not make any contributions in 2019 or 2018.\n2. REGULATORY ACCOUNTING\nEversource's utility companies are subject to rate regulation that is based on cost recovery and meets the criteria for application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated operations, which considers the effect of regulation on the timing of the recognition of certain revenues and expenses. The regulated companies' financial statements reflect the effects of the rate-making process. The rates charged to the customers of Eversource's regulated companies are designed to collect each company's costs to provide service, plus a return on investment.\nThe application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory assets are amortized as the incurred costs are recovered through customer rates. Regulatory liabilities represent either revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customers.\nManagement believes it is probable that each of the regulated companies will recover its respective investments in long-lived assets and the regulatory assets that have been recorded. If management were to determine that it could no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises, or if management could not conclude it is probable that costs would be recovered from customers in future rates, the applicable costs would be charged to net income in the period in which the determination is made.\nRegulatory Assets: The components of regulatory assets were as follows:\nBenefit Costs: Eversource's Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans are accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance on defined benefit pension and other PBOP plans. The liability (or asset) recorded by the regulated companies to recognize the funded status of their retiree benefit plans is offset by a regulatory asset (or offset by a regulatory liability in the case of a benefit plan asset) in lieu of a charge to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss), reflecting ultimate recovery from customers through rates. The regulatory asset (or regulatory liability) is amortized as the actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost are amortized to net periodic benefit cost for the pension and PBOP plans. All amounts are remeasured annually. Regulatory accounting is also applied to the portions of Eversource's service company costs that support the regulated companies, as these amounts are also recoverable. As these regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities do not represent a cash outlay for the regulated companies, no carrying charge is recovered from customers. See Note 11A, \"Employee Benefits - Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension,\" for further information on regulatory benefit plan amounts recognized and amortized during the year.\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric, and PSNH recover benefit costs related to their distribution and transmission operations from customers in rates as allowed by their applicable regulatory commissions. NSTAR Electric recovers qualified pension and PBOP expenses related to its distribution operations through a rate reconciling mechanism that fully tracks the change in net pension and PBOP expenses each year.\nIncome Taxes, Net: The tax effect of temporary book-tax differences (differences between the periods in which transactions affect income in the financial statements and the periods in which they affect the determination of taxable income, including those differences relating to uncertain tax positions) is accounted for in accordance with the rate-making treatment of the applicable regulatory commissions and accounting guidance for income taxes. Differences in income taxes between the accounting guidance and the rate-making treatment of the applicable regulatory commissions are recorded as regulatory assets. As these assets are offset by deferred income tax liabilities, no carrying charge is collected. The amortization period of these assets varies depending on the nature and/or remaining life of the underlying assets and liabilities. For further information regarding income taxes, see Note 12, \"Income Taxes,\" to the financial statements.\nSecuritized Stranded Costs: In 2018, a subsidiary of PSNH issued $635.7 million of securitized RRBs to finance PSNH's unrecovered remaining costs associated with the divestiture of its generation assets. Securitized regulatory assets, which are not earning an equity return, are being recovered over the amortization period of the associated RRBs. The PSNH RRBs are expected to be repaid by February 1, 2033. For further information, see Note 10, \"Rate Reduction Bonds and Variable Interest Entities.\"\nStorm Restoration Costs, Net: The storm restoration cost deferrals relate to costs incurred for storm events at CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH that each company expects to recover from customers. A storm must meet certain criteria to qualify for deferral and recovery with the criteria specific to each state jurisdiction and utility company. Once a storm qualifies for recovery, all qualifying expenses incurred during storm restoration efforts are deferred and recovered from customers. Costs for storms that do not meet the specific criteria are expensed as incurred. In addition to storm restoration costs, CL&P and PSNH are each allowed to recover pre-staging storm costs. Management believes storm restoration costs deferred were prudently incurred and meet the criteria for specific cost recovery in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and that recovery from customers is probable through the applicable regulatory recovery processes. Each electric utility company either recovers a carrying charge on its deferred storm restoration cost regulatory asset balance or the regulatory asset balance is included in rate base. Of the total deferred storm restoration costs, $591 million is either pending regulatory approval or has yet to be filed with the applicable regulatory commission (including $390 million at CL&P, $166 million at NSTAR Electric and $35 million at PSNH).\nStorm Event: On August 4, 2020, Tropical Storm Isaias caused catastrophic damage to our electric distribution system, which resulted in significant amounts and durations of customer outages, primarily in Connecticut. In terms of customer outages, this storm was one of the worst in CL&P\u2019s history. PURA has opened an investigation into CL&P's response to Tropical Storm Isaias. PURA will also investigate the prudence of costs incurred by CL&P to restore service as part of its response. CL&P is fully participating in PURA\u2019s investigations and believes that these storm restoration costs were prudently incurred and meet the criteria for cost recovery. As a result, management does not expect the storm costs to have a material impact on the results of operations of Eversource or CL&P.\nBased on current estimates, the storm resulted in deferred storm restoration costs on our balance sheets of approximately $228 million at CL&P and $245 million at Eversource as of December 31, 2020. The estimated cost of restoration will change as additional cost information becomes available, final storm costs are deferred or capitalized, and post-storm restoration work is completed. The majority of incremental storm costs relate to third-party vendors that are external field crews needed to restore power and address municipal priorities. CL&P\u2019s current estimate of total storm costs includes its projection of the cost of such vendors, but that estimate will change as CL&P receives and examines all storm related invoices.\nRegulatory Tracker Mechanisms: The regulated companies' approved rates are designed to recover costs incurred to provide service to customers. The regulated companies recover certain of their costs on a fully-reconciling basis through regulatory commission-approved tracking mechanisms. The differences between the costs incurred (or the rate recovery allowed) and the actual revenues are recorded as regulatory assets (for undercollections) or as regulatory liabilities (for overcollections) to be included in future customer rates each year. Carrying charges are recovered in rates on all material regulatory tracker mechanisms.\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each recover, on a fully reconciling basis, the costs associated with the procurement of energy, transmission related costs from FERC-approved transmission tariffs, energy efficiency programs, low income assistance programs, certain uncollectible accounts receivable for hardship customers, and restructuring and stranded costs as a result of deregulation (including securitized RRB charges), and additionally for the Massachusetts utilities, pension and PBOP benefits and net metering for distributed generation. Energy procurement costs at NSTAR Electric include the costs related to its solar power facilities.\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric, Yankee Gas, NSTAR Gas and EGMA each have a regulatory commission approved revenue decoupling mechanism. Distribution revenues are decoupled from customer sales volumes, where applicable, which breaks the relationship between sales volumes and revenues. Each company reconciles its annual base distribution rate recovery amount to the pre-established levels of baseline distribution delivery service revenues. Any difference between the allowed level of distribution revenue and the actual amount realized during a 12-month period is adjusted through rates in the following period.\nCL&P Rate Suspension: On July 31, 2020, PURA temporarily suspended its June 26, 2020 approval of certain delivery rate components effective July 1, 2020, and ordered CL&P to restore rates to those in effect as of June 30, 2020 in order to allow PURA time to reexamine the rates to ensure that CL&P is not over-collecting revenues in the short-term. Rates were adjusted effective August 1, 2020. On December 2, 2020, PURA issued a final decision in which it adjusted the timing of the annual rate adjustments for the Revenue Decoupling Mechanism Charge, the Transmission Adjustment Clause charge, the Non-Bypassable Federally Mandated Congestion Charge, and the Electric System Improvements Tracker so that these rates take effect on May 1st of each year, as opposed to the current process of adjusting rates each January 1 and July 1. The temporary suspension of rates has resulted in a current period under-recovery of costs, which results in an increase to our regulatory assets, with no impact on the statement of income other than carrying charges, and a delay in the collection of our costs. This deferral is reflected within Regulatory Tracker Mechanisms in the table above.\nDerivative Liabilities: Regulatory assets are recorded as an offset to derivative liabilities and relate to the fair value of contracts used to purchase energy and energy-related products that will be recovered from customers in future rates. These assets are excluded from rate base and are being recovered as the actual settlements occur over the duration of the contracts. See Note 4, \"Derivative Instruments,\" to the financial statements for further information on these contracts.\nGoodwill-related: The goodwill regulatory asset originated from a 1999 transaction, and the DPU allowed its recovery in NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas rates. This regulatory asset is currently being amortized and recovered from customers in rates without a carrying charge over a 40-year period, and as of December 31, 2020, there were 19 years of amortization remaining.\nAsset Retirement Obligations: The costs associated with the depreciation of the regulated companies' ARO assets and accretion of the ARO liabilities are recorded as regulatory assets in accordance with regulatory accounting guidance. The regulated companies' ARO assets, regulatory assets, and ARO liabilities offset and are excluded from rate base. These costs are being recovered over the life of the underlying property, plant and equipment.\nOther Regulatory Assets: Other Regulatory Assets primarily include contractual obligations associated with the spent nuclear fuel storage costs of the CYAPC, YAEC and MYAPC decommissioned nuclear power facilities, environmental remediation costs, losses associated with the reacquisition or redemption of long-term debt, certain uncollectible accounts receivable for hardship customers, certain merger-related costs allowed for recovery, water tank painting costs, and various other items.\nRegulatory Costs in Long-Term Assets: Eversource's regulated companies had $196.9 million (including $84.1 million for CL&P, $69.8 million for NSTAR Electric and $4.3 million for PSNH) and $146.0 million (including $51.8 million for CL&P, $55.7 million for NSTAR Electric and $18.0 million for PSNH) of additional regulatory costs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, that were included in long-term assets on the balance sheets. These amounts represent incurred costs for which recovery has not yet been specifically approved by the applicable regulatory agency. However, based on regulatory policies or past precedent on similar costs, management believes it is probable that these costs will ultimately be approved and recovered from customers in rates. As of December 31, 2020, net incremental costs as a result of COVID-19 deferred by Eversource totaled $24.0 million, of which $15.8 million ($3.0 million at CL&P, $6.8 million at NSTAR Electric and $0.6 million at PSNH) was related to non-tracked uncollectible expense and $8.2 million ($1.7 million at CL&P, $5.1 million at NSTAR Electric and $0.5 million at PSNH) related to facilities and fleet cleaning, sanitizing costs and supplies for personal protective equipment.\nEquity Return on Regulatory Assets: For rate-making purposes, the regulated companies recover the carrying costs related to their regulatory assets. For certain regulatory assets, the carrying cost recovered includes an equity return component. This equity return, which is not recorded on the balance sheets, totaled $0.2 million and $0.5 million for CL&P as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $5.1 million and $6.5 million for PSNH as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These carrying costs will be recovered from customers in future rates.\nRegulatory Liabilities: The components of regulatory liabilities were as follows:\nEDIT due to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017: Pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Eversource had remeasured its existing deferred federal income tax balances to reflect the decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. The remeasurement resulted in provisional regulated excess accumulated deferred income tax (excess ADIT or EDIT) liabilities that will benefit our customers in future periods and were recognized as regulatory liabilities on the balance sheet. EDIT liabilities related to property, plant, and equipment are subject to IRS normalization rules and will be returned to customers using the same timing as the remaining useful lives of the underlying assets that gave rise to the ADIT liabilities.\nEversource's regulated companies are in the process of, or will be, refunding the EDIT liabilities to customers based on orders issued by applicable state regulatory commissions. For PSNH (effective January 1, 2021), CL&P (effective May 1, 2019) and Yankee Gas (effective November 15, 2018), the refund of EDIT liabilities was incorporated into base distribution rates. For NSTAR Electric (effective January 1, 2019) and NSTAR Gas (effective February 1, 2019), the refund of EDIT liabilities occurred in rates through a new reconciling factor. The Connecticut water business has not yet begun to reflect the refund of EDIT in distribution rates. See \"Recent Regulatory Developments\" below for information on the PSNH 2020 rate settlement agreement and the impact on the EDIT balance.\nCost of Removal: Eversource's regulated companies currently recover amounts in rates for future costs of removal of plant assets over the lives of the assets. The estimated cost to remove utility assets from service is recognized as a component of depreciation expense, and the cumulative amount collected from customers but not yet expended is recognized as a regulatory liability.\nAFUDC - Transmission: Regulatory liabilities were recorded by CL&P and NSTAR Electric for AFUDC accrued on certain reliability-related transmission projects to reflect local rate base recovery. These regulatory liabilities will be amortized over the depreciable life of the related transmission assets.\nFERC ROE Complaints: As of December 31, 2020, Eversource has a reserve established for the second ROE complaint period in the pending FERC ROE complaint proceedings, which was recorded as a regulatory liability and is reflected within Regulatory Tracker Mechanisms in the table above. The cumulative pre-tax reserve (excluding interest) as of December 31, 2020 totaled $39.1 million for Eversource (including $21.4 million for CL&P, $14.6 million for NSTAR Electric and $3.1 million for PSNH). See Note 13E, \"Commitments and Contingencies - FERC ROE Complaints,\" for further information on developments in the pending ROE complaint proceedings.\nRecent Regulatory Developments:\nPSNH Distribution Rates: On December 15, 2020, the NHPUC approved an October 9, 2020 settlement agreement on permanent rates between PSNH and all parties to the proceeding. The NHPUC approved a permanent rate increase of $45.0 million effective January 1, 2021, inclusive of the temporary rate increase previously approved. PSNH was also permitted three step increases, effective January 1, 2021, August 1, 2021, and August 1, 2022, to reflect plant additions in calendar years 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. On December 23, 2020, the NHPUC approved the first step adjustment for 2019 plant in service to recover a revenue requirement of $10.6 million, subject to reconciliation after completion of an audit, effective January 1, 2021. The settlement agreement also established an authorized regulatory ROE of 9.3 percent with a 54.4 percent common equity ratio in PSNH\u2019s capital structure and provided for a new tracker to recover regulatory assessments, vegetation management costs, property tax costs, and lost distribution revenue attributable to net metering. In addition, base distribution rates were adjusted to reflect the refund of EDIT from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nThe settlement agreement allowed for the effect of the permanent rate increase to be extended back to the temporary rate period. In lieu of a customer rate increase for this recoupment of revenue, the NHPUC directed a portion of the total EDIT regulatory liability to offset bill impacts to customers. The impact of the settlement agreement resulted in an after-tax benefit to earnings in 2020 of $11.0 million at Eversource ($7.2 million at PSNH), due primarily to the reconciliation of permanent rates back to the temporary rate period resulting in a reduction of the EDIT regulatory liability, which reduced Income Tax Expense on the statement of income, and the allowed recovery of previously expensed costs. The earnings impact was partially offset by the negative impact from the over-refunding of the change in the 2018 federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that was reflected in temporary rates, which reduced Operating Revenues on the statement of income.\nPSNH Generation Asset Divestiture-Related Costs: On May 15, 2020, the NHPUC Audit Staff issued a final report on the audit of PSNH\u2019s generation asset divestiture-related costs and resulting securitized and stranded costs. The findings in the audit report as well as other aspects of the divestiture process were further investigated by NHPUC Staff through the discovery phase, which was completed in July 2020. On September 30, 2020, PSNH filed a settlement agreement on the generation asset divestiture-related costs with the NHPUC Audit Staff. The settlement agreement resolved all issues with respect to PSNH\u2019s divestiture of its generating assets and the recovery of $12.0 million of divestiture-related costs incurred above the $635.7 million amount previously securitized. On December 17, 2020, the NHPUC approved the additional $12.0 million proposed in the settlement agreement to be recovered over a one-year period through the SCRC rate beginning February 1, 2021. As a result of the settlement agreement, the $12.0 million of divestiture-related costs were transferred from Other Long-Term Assets to Regulatory Assets on the Eversource and PSNH balance sheets as of December 31, 2020.\nNSTAR Gas Rate Case: On October 30, 2020, the DPU approved a base distribution rate increase of $23.0 million effective November 1, 2020, compared to the original request of $38.0 million. NSTAR Gas' 2019 plant additions are allowed recovery beginning on November 1, 2021. Thus, the reduced revenue requirement reflects the removal of this recovery, among other adjustments. The DPU also approved NSTAR Gas' proposal to continue its ongoing Gas System Enhancement Program (GSEP), the inclusion of GSEP investments since 2015 into base rates, and the implementation of a 10-year performance-based ratemaking plan, which includes an inflation-based adjustment mechanism to annual base distribution rates. The decision allows an authorized regulatory ROE of 9.9 percent on a capital structure including 54.77 percent equity. The decision also approves a geothermal pilot program. The impact of the rate case decision resulted in a pre-tax charge to earnings in 2020 of $2.7 million at NSTAR Gas, primarily due to certain plant-related disallowances.\nEGMA Rate Settlement Agreement: On October 7, 2020, the DPU approved a rate settlement agreement, which approved the CMA asset acquisition as well as a rate stabilization plan, among other items. See Note 24, \"Acquisition of Assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts\" for further information.\n3. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION\nUtility property, plant and equipment is recorded at original cost. Original cost includes materials, labor, construction overheads and AFUDC for regulated property. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to Operations and Maintenance expense as incurred.\nThe following tables summarize property, plant and equipment by asset category:\n(1)These assets are primarily comprised of computer software, hardware and equipment at Eversource Service and buildings at The Rocky River Realty Company.\nOn October 9, 2020, Eversource completed the CMA asset acquisition. EGMA\u2019s net plant assets of $1.20 billion are reflected in the natural gas distribution asset category as of December 31, 2020.\nOn July 31, 2020, Eversource sold its water system and treatment plant that supplies water to the towns of Hingham, Hull and North Cohasset to the town of Hingham, Massachusetts. Net property, plant and equipment of $63.9 million and goodwill of $23.6 million were included in determining the gain on sale. Proceeds from the sale were $110.5 million, with a pre-tax gain of $16.0 million (after-tax gain of $3.5 million) recognized within Operations and Maintenance Expense on the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The assets and liabilities associated with the sale of the business were previously reflected in the Water Distribution segment and reporting unit.\nDepreciation: Depreciation of utility assets is calculated on a straight-line basis using composite rates based on the estimated remaining useful lives of the various classes of property (estimated useful life for PSNH distribution and the water utilities). The composite rates, which are subject to approval by the appropriate state regulatory agency, include a cost of removal component, which is collected from customers over the lives of the plant assets and is recognized as a regulatory liability. Depreciation rates are applied to property from the time it is placed in service.\nUpon retirement from service, the cost of the utility asset is charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation. The actual incurred removal costs are applied against the related regulatory liability.\nThe depreciation rates for the various classes of utility property, plant and equipment aggregate to composite rates as follows:\nThe following table summarizes average remaining useful lives of depreciable assets:\n(1)The estimated useful life of computer software, hardware and equipment primarily ranges from 5 to 15 years and of buildings is 40 years.\n4. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nThe electric and natural gas companies purchase and procure energy and energy-related products, which are subject to price volatility, for their customers. The costs associated with supplying energy to customers are recoverable from customers in future rates. These regulated companies manage the risks associated with the price volatility of energy and energy-related products through the use of derivative and non-derivative contracts.\nMany of the derivative contracts meet the definition of, and are designated as, normal and qualify for accrual accounting under the applicable accounting guidance. The costs and benefits of derivative contracts that meet the definition of normal are recognized in Operating Expenses on the statements of income, as applicable, as electricity or natural gas is delivered.\nDerivative contracts that are not designated as normal are recorded at fair value as current or long-term Derivative Assets or Derivative Liabilities on the balance sheets. For the electric and natural gas companies, regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities are recorded to offset the fair values of derivatives, as contract settlement amounts are recovered from, or refunded to, customers in their respective energy supply rates.\nThe gross fair values of derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are offset and reported as net Derivative Assets or Derivative Liabilities, with current and long-term portions, on the balance sheets. The following table presents the gross fair values of contracts, categorized by risk type, and the net amounts recorded as current or long-term derivative assets or liabilities:\n(1) Amounts represent derivative assets and liabilities that Eversource elected to record net on the balance sheets. These amounts are subject to master netting agreements or similar agreements for which the right of offset exists.\nThe business activities that result in the recognition of derivative assets also create exposure to various counterparties. As of December 31, 2020, CL&P's derivative assets were exposed to counterparty credit risk and contracted with investment grade entities.\nFor further information on the fair value of derivative contracts, see Note 1I, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Fair Value Measurements,\" and Note 1J, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Derivative Accounting,\" to the financial statements.\nDerivative Contracts at Fair Value with Offsetting Regulatory Amounts\nCommodity Supply and Price Risk Management: As required by regulation, CL&P, along with UI, has capacity-related contracts with generation facilities. CL&P has a sharing agreement with UI, with 80 percent of the costs or benefits of each contract borne by or allocated to CL&P and 20 percent borne by or allocated to UI. The combined capacities of these contracts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 675 MW and 676 MW, respectively. The capacity contracts extend through 2026 and obligate both CL&P and UI to make or receive payments on a monthly basis to or from the generation facilities based on the difference between a set capacity price and the capacity market price received in the ISO-NE capacity markets. In addition, CL&P had a contract to purchase 0.1 million MWh of energy per year through 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Eversource had New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) financial contracts for natural gas futures in order to reduce variability associated with the price of 8.9 million and 9.6 million MMBtu of natural gas, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were losses of $21.2 million, $20.7 million and $25.0 million, respectively, deferred as regulatory costs, which reflect the change in fair value associated with Eversource's derivative contracts.\nFair Value Measurements of Derivative Instruments\nDerivative contracts classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy relate to the financial contracts for natural gas futures. Prices are obtained from broker quotes and are based on actual market activity. The contracts are valued using NYMEX natural gas prices. Valuations of these contracts also incorporate discount rates using the yield curve approach.\nThe fair value of derivative contracts classified as Level 3 utilizes significant unobservable inputs. The fair value is modeled using income techniques, such as discounted cash flow valuations adjusted for assumptions related to exit price. Significant observable inputs for valuations of these contracts include energy and energy-related product prices in future years for which quoted prices in an active market exist. Fair value measurements categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are prepared by individuals with expertise in valuation techniques, pricing of energy and energy-related products, and accounting requirements. The future capacity prices for periods that are not quoted in an active market or established at auction are based on available market data and are escalated based on estimates of inflation in order to address the full term of the contract.\nValuations of derivative contracts using a discounted cash flow methodology include assumptions regarding the timing and likelihood of scheduled payments and also reflect non-performance risk, including credit, using the default probability approach based on the counterparty's credit rating for assets and the Company's credit rating for liabilities. Valuations incorporate estimates of premiums or discounts that would be required by a market participant to arrive at an exit price, using historical market transactions adjusted for the terms of the contract.\nThe following is a summary of Level 3 derivative contracts and the range of the significant unobservable inputs utilized in the valuations over the duration of the contracts:\n(1) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative future capacity and forward reserve prices and contractual MWs over the periods covered.\nExit price premiums of 7.1 percent through 11.4 percent, or a weighted average of 10.3 percent, are also applied to these contracts and reflect the uncertainty and illiquidity premiums that would be required based on the most recent market activity available for similar type contracts. The risk premium was weighted by the relative fair value of the net derivative instruments.\nSignificant increases or decreases in future capacity or forward reserve prices in isolation would decrease or increase, respectively, the fair value of the derivative liability. Any increases in risk premiums would increase the fair value of the derivative liability. Changes in these fair values are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability and do not impact net income.\nValuations using significant unobservable inputs: The following table presents changes in the Level 3 category of derivative assets and derivative liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis.\n5. MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nEversource holds marketable securities that are primarily used to fund certain non-qualified executive benefits. The trusts that hold marketable securities are not subject to regulatory oversight by state or federal agencies. CYAPC and YAEC maintain legally restricted trusts, each of which holds marketable securities, to fund the spent nuclear fuel removal obligations of their nuclear fuel storage facilities.\nEquity Securities: Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities held in Eversource's non-qualified executive benefit trust are recorded in Other Income, Net on the statements of income. The fair value of these equity securities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $40.9 million and $45.7 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were unrealized gains of $3.7 million and $9.8 million recorded in Other Income, Net related to these equity securities, respectively.\nEversource's equity securities also include CYAPC's and YAEC's marketable securities held in spent nuclear fuel trusts, which had fair values of $205.1 million and $182.8 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Unrealized gains and losses for these spent nuclear fuel trusts are subject to regulatory accounting treatment and are recorded in Marketable Securities with the corresponding offset to Other Long-Term Liabilities on the balance sheets, with no impact on the statements of income.\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities: The following is a summary of the available-for-sale debt securities, which are recorded at fair value and are included in current and long-term Marketable Securities on the balance sheets.\nEversource's debt securities include CYAPC's and YAEC's marketable securities held in spent nuclear fuel trusts in the amounts of $192.5 million and $198.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nUnrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities held in Eversource's non-qualified benefit trust are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, excluding amounts related to credit losses or losses on securities intended to be sold, which are recorded in Other Income, Net. There have been no significant unrealized losses and no credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019, and no allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020. Factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists include adverse conditions specifically affecting the issuer, the payment history, ratings and rating changes of the security, and the severity of the impairment. For asset-backed debt securities, underlying collateral and expected future cash flows are also evaluated. Debt securities included in Eversource's non-qualified benefit trust portfolio are investment-grade bonds with a lower default risk based on their credit quality.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the contractual maturities of available-for-sale debt securities were as follows:\n(1) Amounts in the Less than one year category include securities in the CYAPC and YAEC spent nuclear fuel trusts, which are restricted and are classified in long-term Marketable Securities on the balance sheets.\nRealized Gains and Losses: Realized gains and losses are recorded in Other Income, Net for Eversource's benefit trust and are offset in Other Long-Term Liabilities for CYAPC and YAEC. Eversource utilizes the specific identification basis method for the Eversource non-qualified benefit trust, and the average cost basis method for the CYAPC and YAEC spent nuclear fuel trusts to compute the realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities.\nFair Value Measurements: The following table presents the marketable securities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis by the level in which they are classified within the fair value hierarchy:\nU.S. government issued debt securities are valued using market approaches that incorporate transactions for the same or similar bonds and adjustments for yields and maturity dates. Corporate debt securities are valued using a market approach, utilizing recent trades of the same or similar instruments and also incorporating yield curves, credit spreads and specific bond terms and conditions. Asset-backed debt securities include collateralized mortgage obligations, commercial mortgage backed securities, and securities collateralized by auto loans, credit card loans or receivables. Asset-backed debt securities are valued using recent trades of similar instruments, prepayment assumptions, yield curves, issuance and maturity dates, and tranche information. Municipal bonds are valued using a market approach that incorporates reported trades and benchmark yields. Other fixed income securities are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, and discounted cash flows.\n6. INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES\nInvestments in entities that are not consolidated are included in long-term assets on the balance sheets and earnings impacts from these equity investments are included in Other Income, Net on the statements of income. Eversource's investments included the following:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, Eversource had equity in earnings, net of impairment, of unconsolidated affiliates of $14.2 million, $42.2 million, and $3.8 million, respectively. Eversource received dividends from its equity method investees of $21.8 million, $48.9 million, and $22.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nInvestments in affiliates where Eversource has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee are initially recognized as an equity method investment at cost. Any differences between the cost of an investment and the amount of underlying equity in net assets of an investee are considered basis differences, and are determined based upon the estimated fair values of the investee's identifiable assets and liabilities. The carrying amount of Eversource\u2019s offshore wind investments exceeded its share of underlying equity in net assets by $264.1 million and $240.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020, these basis differences are primarily comprised of $168.3 million of equity method goodwill that is not being amortized, intangible assets for PPAs, which will be amortized over the term of the PPAs, and capitalized interest.\nOffshore Wind Business: Eversource's offshore wind business includes ownership interests in North East Offshore and Bay State Wind, which together hold PPAs and contracts for the Revolution Wind, South Fork Wind, and Sunrise Wind projects, as well as offshore leases through BOEM. Eversource's offshore wind projects are being developed and constructed through a joint and equal partnership with \u00d8rsted. On February 8, 2019, Eversource and \u00d8rsted entered into an equal partnership to acquire key offshore wind assets in the Northeast. Eversource has a 50 percent ownership interest in North East Offshore, which holds the Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind projects, as well as a 257 square-mile lease off the coasts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Eversource also has a 50 percent ownership interest in Bay State Wind, which holds the Sunrise Wind project. Bay State Wind's separate 300-square-mile ocean lease is located approximately 25 miles south of the coast of Massachusetts adjacent to the North East Offshore area.\nNSTAR Electric: As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, NSTAR Electric's investments included a 14.5 percent ownership interest in two companies that transmit hydro-electricity imported from the Hydro-Quebec system in Canada of $8.6 million and $8.2 million, respectively.\nImpairment of Equity Method Investments: Equity method investments are assessed for impairment when conditions exist that indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than book value. If the decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value, which establishes a new cost basis in the investment. Impairment evaluations involve a significant degree of judgment and estimation, including identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist and developing undiscounted future cash flows.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, Eversource recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $2.8 million within Other Income, Net on the statement of income, related to a write-off of an investment within a renewable energy fund.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, Eversource recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $32.9 million within Other Income, Net on the statement of income, related to Access Northeast, a natural gas pipeline and storage project, which represented the full carrying value of our equity method investment. On April 1, 2019, pursuant to a provision in the partnership agreement jointly entered into by Eversource, Enbridge, Inc. and National Grid plc, through Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC, the Access Northeast project was terminated.\n7. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nEversource, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, recognizes a liability for the fair value of an ARO on the obligation date if the liability's fair value can be reasonably estimated, even if it is conditional on a future event. Settlement dates and future costs are reasonably estimated when sufficient information becomes available. Management has identified various categories of AROs, primarily CYAPC's and YAEC's obligation to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste, and also certain assets containing asbestos and hazardous contamination. Management has performed fair value calculations reflecting expected probabilities for settlement scenarios.\nThe fair value of an ARO is recorded as a liability in Other Long-Term Liabilities with a corresponding amount included in Property, Plant and Equipment, Net on the balance sheets. The ARO assets are depreciated, and the ARO liabilities are accreted over the estimated life of the obligation and the corresponding credits are recorded as accumulated depreciation and ARO liabilities, respectively. As the electric and natural gas companies are rate-regulated on a cost-of-service basis, these companies apply regulatory accounting guidance and both the depreciation and accretion costs associated with these companies' AROs are recorded as increases to Regulatory Assets on the balance sheets.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending carrying amounts of ARO liabilities is as follows:\nThe ARO balance includes the current portion of $1.0 million for Eversource and NSTAR Electric as of December 31, 2019, which is included in Other Current Liabilities on the balance sheets.\nEversource's amounts include CYAPC and YAEC's AROs of $330.3 million and $337.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fair value of the ARO for CYAPC and YAEC includes uncertainties of the fuel off-load dates related to the DOE's timing of performance regarding its obligation to dispose of the spent nuclear fuel and high level waste and other assumptions, including discount rates. The incremental asset recorded as an offset to the ARO liability was fully depreciated since the plants have no remaining useful life. Any changes in the ARO liability are recorded with a corresponding offset to the related regulatory asset. The assets held in the CYAPC and YAEC spent nuclear fuel trusts are restricted for settling the ARO and all other nuclear fuel storage obligations. For further information on the assets held in the spent nuclear fuel trusts, see Note 5, \"Marketable Securities,\" to the financial statements.\n8. SHORT-TERM DEBT\nShort-Term Debt - Borrowing Limits: The amount of short-term borrowings that may be incurred by CL&P and NSTAR Electric is subject to periodic approval by the FERC. Because the NHPUC has jurisdiction over PSNH's short-term debt, PSNH is not currently required to obtain FERC approval for its short-term borrowings. On October 25, 2019, the FERC granted authorization that allows CL&P to issue total short-term borrowings in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $600 million outstanding at any one time, through December 31, 2021. On December 18, 2019, the FERC granted authorization that allows NSTAR Electric to issue total short-term borrowings in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $655 million outstanding at any one time, through December 31, 2021.\nPSNH is authorized by regulation of the NHPUC to incur short-term borrowings up to 10 percent of net fixed plant plus an additional $60 million until further ordered by the NHPUC. As of December 31, 2020, PSNH's short-term debt authorization under the 10 percent of net fixed plant test plus $60 million totaled $383.9 million.\nCL&P's certificate of incorporation contains preferred stock provisions restricting the amount of unsecured debt that CL&P may incur, including limiting unsecured indebtedness with a maturity of less than 10 years to 10 percent of total capitalization. As of December 31, 2020, CL&P had $907.6 million of unsecured debt capacity available under this authorization.\nYankee Gas, NSTAR Gas and EGMA are not required to obtain approval from any state or federal authority to incur short-term debt.\nShort-Term Debt - Commercial Paper Programs and Credit Agreements: Eversource parent has a $2.00 billion commercial paper program allowing Eversource parent to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt. Eversource parent, CL&P, PSNH, NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas and Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut are parties to a five-year $1.45 billion revolving credit facility, which terminates on December 6, 2024. On October 21, 2020, Eversource parent and EGMA entered into a short-term $550 million revolving credit facility, which terminates on October 20, 2021. These revolving credit facilities serve to backstop Eversource parent's $2.00 billion commercial paper program.\nNSTAR Electric has a $650 million commercial paper program allowing NSTAR Electric to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt. NSTAR Electric is also a party to a five-year $650 million revolving credit facility, which terminates on December 6, 2024. The revolving credit facility serves to backstop NSTAR Electric's $650 million commercial paper program.\nThe amount of borrowings outstanding and available under the commercial paper programs were as follows:\nThere were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nOn May 15, 2020, CL&P and PSNH entered into uncommitted line of credit agreements, which will expire by May 14, 2021. The CL&P agreements total $450 million and the PSNH agreements total $300 million. There are no borrowings outstanding on either the CL&P or PSNH uncommitted line of credit agreements as of December 31, 2020.\nAmounts outstanding under the commercial paper programs are included in Notes Payable and classified in current liabilities on the Eversource and NSTAR Electric balance sheets, as all borrowings are outstanding for no more than 364 days at one time.\nUnder the credit facilities described above, Eversource and its subsidiaries, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, NSTAR Gas, EGMA, Yankee Gas, and Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut, must comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Eversource and its subsidiaries were in compliance with these covenants. If Eversource or its subsidiaries were not in compliance with these covenants, an event of default would occur requiring all outstanding borrowings by such borrower to be repaid, and additional borrowings by such borrower would not be permitted under its respective credit facility.\nThe Company expects the future operating cash flows of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, along with existing borrowing availability and access to both debt and equity markets, will be sufficient to meet any working capital and future operating requirements, and capital investment forecasted opportunities.\nIntercompany Borrowings: Eversource parent uses its available capital resources to provide loans to its subsidiaries to assist in meeting their short-term borrowing needs. Eversource parent records intercompany interest income from its loans to subsidiaries, which is eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany loans from Eversource parent to its subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation on Eversource's balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020, there were intercompany loans from Eversource parent to PSNH of $46.3 million, and to a subsidiary of NSTAR Electric of $21.3 million. As of December 31, 2019, there were intercompany loans from Eversource parent to CL&P of $63.8 million, to PSNH of $27.0 million, and to a subsidiary of NSTAR Electric of $30.3 million. Intercompany loans from Eversource parent are included in Notes Payable to Eversource Parent and classified in current liabilities on the respective subsidiary's balance sheets.\n9. LONG-TERM DEBT\nDetails of long-term debt outstanding are as follows:\n(1) The fair value adjustment amount is the purchase price adjustments, net of amortization, required to record long-term debt at fair value on the dates of the 2012 merger with NSTAR and the 2017 acquisition of Aquarion.\nLong-Term Debt Issuance Authorizations: On January 27, 2020, the DPU approved NSTAR Gas' request for authorization to issue up to $270 million in long-term debt through December 31, 2021. On July 31, 2020, the NHPUC approved PSNH's request for authorization to issue up to $200 million in long-term debt through December 31, 2020. On December 14, 2020, NSTAR Electric filed a petition with the DPU for authorization to issue $1.6 billion in long-term debt through December 31, 2023. On December 16, 2020, Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut filed an application with PURA for authorization to issue $100 million in long-term debt through December 31, 2021.\nLong-Term Debt Issuances and Repayments: The following table summarizes long-term debt issuances and repayments:\n(1) These senior notes are part of the same series issued by Eversource parent in January 2020. The aggregate outstanding principal amount of these senior notes is now $650 million.\n(2) The proceeds from these Eversource parent issuances funded a portion of the purchase price for the CMA asset acquisition and refinanced short-term borrowings.\nIn January 2021, PSNH provided a redemption notice to the holders of the PSNH 4.050% Series Q First Mortgage Bonds that PSNH will redeem the $122 million of bonds on March 1, 2021, the par call date, in advance of the June 1, 2021 maturity date.\nLong-Term Debt Provisions: The utility plant of CL&P, PSNH, Yankee Gas, NSTAR Gas and a portion of Aquarion is subject to the lien of each company's respective first mortgage bond indenture. The Eversource parent, NSTAR Electric and a portion of Aquarion debt is unsecured. Additionally, the long-term debt agreements provide that Eversource and certain of its subsidiaries must comply with certain covenants as are customarily included in such agreements, including equity requirements for NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and Aquarion. Under the equity requirements, NSTAR Electric's and Aquarion's senior notes must maintain a certain consolidated indebtedness to capitalization ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter and NSTAR Gas' outstanding long-term debt must not exceed equity.\nCL&P's obligation to repay the Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (PCRBs) is secured by first mortgage bonds. The first mortgage bonds contain similar terms and provisions as the applicable series of PCRBs. If CL&P fails to meet its obligations under the first mortgage bonds, then the holder of the first mortgage bonds (the issuer of the PCRBs) would have rights under the first mortgage bonds. CL&P's tax-exempt PCRBs will be subject to redemption at par on or after September 1, 2021.\nCertain secured and unsecured long-term debt securities are callable at redemption price or are subject to make-whole provisions.\nNo long-term debt defaults have occurred as of December 31, 2020.\nCYAPC's Pre-1983 Spent Nuclear Fuel Obligation: Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE is responsible for the selection and development of repositories for, and the disposal of, spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. CYAPC is obligated to pay the DOE for the costs to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste generated prior to April 7, 1983 (pre-1983 Spent Nuclear Fuel) and recorded an accrual for the full liability thereof to the DOE. This liability accrues interest costs at the 3-month Treasury bill yield rate. For nuclear fuel used to generate electricity prior to April 7, 1983, payment may be made any time prior to the first delivery of spent fuel to the DOE. Fees for disposal of nuclear fuel burned on or after April 7, 1983 were billed to member companies and paid to the DOE.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, as a result of consolidating CYAPC, Eversource has consolidated $11.7 million and $11.6 million, respectively, in pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel obligations to the DOE. In December 2019, CYAPC paid $29 million to the DOE to partially settle this obligation. The obligation includes accumulated interest costs of $8.7 million and $8.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. CYAPC maintains a trust to fund amounts due to the DOE for the disposal of pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel. For further information, see Note 5, \"Marketable Securities,\" to the financial statements.\nLong-Term Debt Maturities: Long-term debt maturities on debt outstanding for the years 2021 through 2025 and thereafter are shown below. These amounts exclude PSNH rate reduction bonds, CYAPC pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel obligation, net unamortized premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs, and other fair value adjustments as of December 31, 2020:\n10. RATE REDUCTION BONDS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nRate Reduction Bonds: On May 8, 2018, PSNH Funding, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PSNH, issued $635.7 million of securitized RRBs in multiple tranches with a weighted average interest rate of 3.66 percent, and final maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2035. The RRBs are expected to be repaid by February 1, 2033. RRB payments consist of principal and interest and are paid semi-annually, beginning on February 1, 2019. The RRBs were issued pursuant to a finance order issued by the NHPUC on January 30, 2018 to recover remaining costs resulting from the divestiture of PSNH\u2019s generation assets.\nThe proceeds were used by PSNH Funding to purchase PSNH\u2019s stranded cost asset-recovery property, including its vested property right to bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable stranded cost recovery charge from PSNH\u2019s retail customers. The collections are used to pay principal, interest and other costs in connection with the RRBs. The RRBs are secured by the stranded cost asset-recovery property. Cash collections from the stranded cost recovery charges and funds on deposit in trust accounts are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. PSNH is not the owner of the RRBs, and PSNH Funding\u2019s assets and revenues are not available to pay PSNH\u2019s creditors. The RRBs are non-recourse senior secured obligations of PSNH Funding and are not insured or guaranteed by PSNH or Eversource Energy.\nPSNH Funding was formed solely to issue RRBs to finance PSNH's unrecovered remaining costs associated with the divestiture of its generation assets. PSNH Funding is considered a VIE primarily because the equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. PSNH has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE and is most closely associated with the VIE as compared to other interest holders. Therefore, PSNH is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates PSNH Funding in its consolidated financial statements. The following tables summarize the impact of PSNH Funding on PSNH's balance sheets and income statements:\nVariable Interest Entities - Other: The Company's variable interests outside of the consolidated group include contracts that are required by regulation and provide for regulatory recovery of contract costs and benefits through customer rates. Eversource, CL&P and NSTAR Electric hold variable interests in VIEs through agreements with certain entities that own single renewable energy or peaking generation power plants, with other independent power producers and with transmission businesses. Eversource, CL&P and NSTAR Electric do not control the activities that are economically significant to these VIEs or provide financial or other support to these VIEs. Therefore, Eversource, CL&P and NSTAR Electric do not consolidate these VIEs.\n11. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nA. Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension\nEversource provides defined benefit retirement plans (Pension Plans) that cover eligible employees and are subject to the provisions of ERISA, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Eversource's policy is to annually fund the Pension Plans in an amount at least equal to an amount that will satisfy all federal funding requirements. In addition to the Pension Plans, Eversource maintains non-qualified defined benefit retirement plans (SERP Plans) which provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations to eligible participants consisting of current and retired employees.\nEversource also provides defined benefit postretirement plans (PBOP Plans) that provide life insurance and a health reimbursement arrangement created for the purpose of reimbursing retirees and dependents for health insurance premiums and certain medical expenses to eligible employees that meet certain age and service eligibility requirements. The benefits provided under the PBOP Plans are not vested, and the Company has the right to modify any benefit provision subject to applicable laws at that time. Eversource annually funds postretirement costs through tax deductible contributions to external trusts.\nThe Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans cover eligible employees, including, among others, employees of the regulated companies. Because the regulated companies recover retiree benefit costs from customers through rates, regulatory assets are recorded in lieu of recording an adjustment to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) as an offset to the funded status of the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans. Regulatory accounting is also applied to the portions of the Eversource Service retiree benefit costs that support the regulated companies, as these costs are also recovered from customers. Adjustments to the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans' funded status for the unregulated companies are recorded on an after-tax basis to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss). For further information, see Note 2, \"Regulatory Accounting,\" and Note 16, \"Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss),\" to the financial statements.\nFunded Status: The Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans are accounted for under the multiple-employer approach, with each operating company's balance sheet reflecting its share of the funded status of the plans. Although Eversource maintains marketable securities in a benefit trust, the SERP Plans do not contain any assets. For further information, see Note 5, \"Marketable Securities,\" to the financial statements. The following tables provide information on the plan benefit obligations, fair values of plan assets, and funded status:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase in the benefit obligation was primarily attributable to a decrease in the discount rate, which resulted in an increase to Eversource's pension liability of $603.0 million. The increase in the benefit obligation was partially offset by the actual return on assets exceeding the expected asset return and changes in the mortality assumption. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the increase in the benefit obligation was primarily attributable to a decrease in the discount rate, which resulted in an increase to Eversource's pension liability of $813.1 million, which was partially offset by changes in actual plan experience and changes in other assumptions.\nThe pension and SERP Plans' funded status includes the current portion of the SERP liability totaling $6.8 million and $8.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which is included in Other Current Liabilities on the balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the accumulated benefit obligation for the Pension and SERP Plans is as follows:\nThe Eversource PBOP funded status includes prepaid assets of $34.7 million and $62.7 million recorded in Other Long-Term Assets and liabilities of $24.5 million and $25.8 million included in Accrued Pension, SERP and PBOP on the balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase in the benefit obligation was primarily attributable to a decrease in the discount rate, which resulted in an increase to the Eversource PBOP liability of $68.3 million, and by changes in our retirement assumptions. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the increase in the benefit obligation was primarily attributable to a decrease in the discount rate, which resulted in an increase to the Eversource PBOP liability of $88.6 million.\nThe following actuarial assumptions were used in calculating the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans' year end funded status:\nFor the Eversource Service PBOP Plan, the health care cost trend rate is not applicable. For the Aquarion PBOP Plan, the health care cost trend rate for pre-65 retirees is 6.3 percent, with an ultimate rate of 5 percent in 2023, and for post-65 retirees, the health care trend rate and ultimate rate is 3.5 percent.\nExpense: Eversource charges net periodic benefit expense/(income) for the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans to its subsidiaries based on the actual participant demographic data for each subsidiary's participants. The actual investment return in the trust is allocated to each of the subsidiaries annually in proportion to the investment return expected to be earned during the year. The Company utilizes the spot rate methodology to estimate the discount rate for the service and interest cost components of benefit expense, which provides a more precise measurement by matching projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.\nThe components of net periodic benefit expense/(income) for the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans, prior to amounts capitalized as Property, Plant and Equipment or deferred as regulatory assets for future recovery, are shown below. The service cost component of net periodic benefit expense/(income), less the capitalized portion, is included in Operations and Maintenance expense on the statements of income. The remaining components of net periodic benefit expense/(income), less the deferred portion, are included in Other Income, Net on the statements of income. Pension, SERP and PBOP expense reflected in the statements of cash flows for CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH does not include the intercompany allocations or the corresponding capitalized and deferred portion, as these amounts are cash settled on a short-term basis.\nThe following actuarial assumptions were used to calculate Pension, SERP and PBOP expense amounts:\nFor the Aquarion Pension and PBOP Plans, the expected long-term rate of return was 7 percent for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. For the Aquarion PBOP Plan, the health care cost trend rate was a range of 3.5 percent to 6.5 percent for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 3.5 percent to 6.8 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe following is a summary of the changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in Regulatory Assets and Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) as well as amounts in Regulatory Assets and OCI that were reclassified as net periodic benefit expense during the years presented:\n(1) Amounts include the impact of the CMA asset acquisition from October 9, 2020 through December 31, 2020.\nThe following is a summary of the remaining Regulatory Assets and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income amounts that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit expense as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe difference between the actual return and calculated expected return on plan assets for the Pension and PBOP Plans is reflected as a component of unamortized actuarial gains or losses, which are recorded in Regulatory Assets or Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss). Unamortized actuarial gains or losses are amortized as a component of pension and PBOP expense over the estimated average future employee service period.\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments: The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid by the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans:\nEversource Contributions: Based on the current status of the Pension Plans and federal pension funding requirements, Eversource currently expects to make contributions of $130.0 million in 2021, of which $78.9 million will be contributed by CL&P. The remaining $51.1 million is expected to be contributed by other Eversource subsidiaries, primarily Eversource Service. Eversource currently estimates contributing $2.8 million to the PBOP Plans in 2021.\nFair Value of Pension and PBOP Plan Assets: Pension and PBOP funds are held in external trusts. Trust assets, including accumulated earnings, must be used exclusively for Pension and PBOP payments. Eversource's investment strategy for its Pension and PBOP Plans is to maximize the long-term rates of return on these plans' assets within an acceptable level of risk. The investment strategy for each asset category includes a diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers and it establishes target asset allocations that are routinely reviewed and periodically rebalanced. PBOP assets are comprised of assets held in the PBOP Plan trust, as well as specific assets within the Pension Plan trust (401(h) assets). The investment policy and strategy of the 401(h) assets is consistent with that of the defined benefit pension plan. Eversource's expected long-term rates of return on Pension and PBOP Plan assets are based on target asset allocation assumptions and related expected long-term rates of return. In developing its expected long-term rate of return assumptions for the Pension and PBOP Plans, Eversource evaluated input from consultants, as well as long-term inflation assumptions and historical returns. Management has assumed long-term rates of return of 8.25 percent for the Eversource Service Pension and PBOP Plan assets and a 7 percent long-term rate of return for the Aquarion Plans to estimate its 2021 Pension and PBOP costs.\nThese long-term rates of return are based on the assumed rates of return for the target asset allocations as follows:\nThe taxable assets within the Eversource PBOP Plan have a target asset allocation of 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent fixed income securities. The target asset allocation for the Aquarion Pension Plan is 54 percent equity, 36 percent debt and 10 percent other. The target asset allocation for the Aquarion PBOP Plan is 54 percent equity, 41 percent debt and 5 percent other.\nThe following table presents, by asset category, the Pension and PBOP Plan assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis by the level in which they are classified within the fair value hierarchy:\n(1) United States, Global, Non-United States and Emerging Markets equity securities that are uncategorized include investments in commingled funds and hedge funds that are overlaid with equity index swaps and futures contracts.\n(2) Fixed Income investments that are uncategorized include investments in commingled funds, fixed income funds that invest in a variety of opportunistic and fixed income strategies, and hedge funds that are overlaid with fixed income futures.\n(3) Real assets include real estate funds and hedge funds.\n(4) The assets of the Pension Plan include a 401(h) account that has been allocated to provide health and welfare postretirement benefits under the PBOP Plan.\nThe Company values assets based on observable inputs when available. Equity securities, exchange traded funds and futures contracts classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy are priced based on the closing price on the primary exchange as of the balance sheet date.\nFixed income securities, such as government issued securities and corporate bonds, are included in Level 2 and are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. The pricing models utilize observable inputs such as recent trades for the same or similar instruments, yield curves, discount margins and bond structures. Swaps are valued using pricing models that incorporate interest rates and equity and fixed income index closing prices to determine a net present value of the cash flows.\nCertain investments, such as commingled funds, private equity investments, real estate funds and hedge funds are valued using the net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient. These investments are structured as investment companies offering shares or units to multiple investors for the purpose of providing a return. Commingled funds are recorded at NAV provided by the asset manager, which is based on the market prices of the underlying equity securities. Private Equity investments, Fixed Income partnership funds and Real Assets are valued using the NAV provided by the partnerships, which are based on discounted cash flows of the underlying investments, real estate appraisals or public market comparables of the underlying investments, or the NAV of underlying assets held in hedge funds. Assets valued at NAV are uncategorized in the fair value hierarchy.\nB. Defined Contribution Plans\nEversource maintains defined contribution plans on behalf of eligible participants. The Eversource 401k Plan provides for employee and employer contributions up to statutory limits. For eligible employees, the Eversource 401k Plan provides employer matching contributions of either 100 percent up to a maximum of three percent of eligible compensation or 50 percent up to a maximum of eight percent of eligible compensation. The Eversource 401k Plan also contains a K-Vantage feature for the benefit of eligible participants, which provides an additional annual employer contribution based on age and years of service. K-Vantage participants are not eligible to actively participate in the Eversource Pension Plan.\nThe total Eversource 401k Plan employer matching contributions, including the K-Vantage contributions, were as follows:\nC. Share-Based Payments\nShare-based compensation awards are recorded using a fair-value based method at the date of grant. Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH record compensation expense related to these awards, as applicable, for shares issued or sold to their respective employees and officers, as well as for the allocation of costs associated with shares issued or sold to Eversource's service company employees and officers that support CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH.\nEversource Incentive Plans: Eversource maintains long-term equity-based incentive plans in which Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH employees, officers and board members are eligible to participate. The incentive plans authorize Eversource to grant up to 6,700,000 new shares for various types of awards, including RSUs and performance shares, to eligible employees, officers, and board members. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Eversource had 2,876,601 and 3,302,526 common shares, respectively, available for issuance under these plans.\nEversource accounts for its various share-based plans as follows:\n\u2022RSUs - Eversource records compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period based upon the fair value of Eversource's common shares at the date of grant. The par value of RSUs is reclassified to Common Stock from Capital Surplus, Paid In as RSUs become issued as common shares.\n\u2022Performance Shares - Eversource records compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Performance shares vest based upon the extent to which Company goals are achieved. Vesting of outstanding performance shares is based upon both the Company's EPS growth over the requisite service period and the total shareholder return as compared to the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Index during the requisite service period. The fair value of performance shares is determined at the date of grant using a lattice model.\nRSUs: Eversource granted RSUs under the annual long-term incentive programs that are subject to three-year graded vesting schedules for employees, and one-year graded vesting schedules, or immediate vesting, for board members. RSUs are paid in shares, reduced by amounts sufficient to satisfy withholdings for income taxes, subsequent to vesting. A summary of RSU transactions is as follows:\nThe weighted average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $88.23, $67.91 and $56.69, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the number and weighted average grant-date fair value of unvested RSUs was 379,258 and $77.13 per share, and 439,293 and $63.06 per share, respectively. During 2020, there were 265,020 RSUs at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $62.99 per share that vested during the year and were either paid or deferred. As of December 31, 2020, 294,960 RSUs were fully vested and deferred and an additional 360,295 are expected to vest.\nPerformance Shares: Eversource granted performance shares under the annual long-term incentive programs that vest based upon the extent to which Company goals are achieved at the end of three-year performance measurement periods. Performance shares are paid in shares, after the performance measurement period. A summary of performance share transactions is as follows:\nThe weighted average grant-date fair value of performance shares granted for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $75.36, $68.33 and $56.77, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the number and weighted average grant-date fair value of unvested performance shares was 404,698 and $70.85 per share, and 427,894 and $60.38 per share, respectively. During 2020, there were 233,426 performance shares at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $55.75 per share that vested during the year and were either paid or deferred. As of December 31, 2020, 43,107 performance shares were fully vested and deferred.\nCompensation Expense: The total compensation expense and associated future income tax benefits recognized by Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH for share-based compensation awards were as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was $19.3 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested share-based awards for Eversource, including $3.6 million for CL&P, $5.7 million for NSTAR Electric, and $1.2 million for PSNH. This cost is expected to be recognized ratably over a weighted-average period of 1.74 years for Eversource, CL&P and PSNH, and 1.75 years NSTAR Electric.\nAn income tax rate of 26 percent was used to estimate the tax effect on total share-based payments determined under the fair-value based method for all awards. Beginning in 2019, the Company began issuing treasury shares to settle fully vested RSUs and performance shares under the Company's incentive plans.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, excess tax benefits associated with the distribution of stock compensation awards reduced income tax expense by $6.6 million, $1.5 million, and $1.5 million, respectively, which increased cash flows from operating activities on the statements of cash flows.\nD. Other Retirement Benefits\nEversource provides retirement and other benefits for certain current and past company officers. These benefits are accounted for on an accrual basis and expensed over a period equal to the service lives of the employees. The actuarially-determined liability for these benefits is included in Other Current and Long-Term Liabilities on the balance sheets. The related expense, which includes the allocation of expense associated with Eversource's service company officers that support CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, is included in Operations and Maintenance Expense on the income statements. The liability and expense amounts are as follows:\n12. INCOME TAXES\nThe components of income tax expense are as follows:\nA reconciliation between income tax expense and the expected tax expense at the statutory rate is as follows:\nEversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH file a consolidated federal income tax return and unitary, combined and separate state income tax returns. These entities are also parties to a tax allocation agreement under which taxable subsidiaries do not pay any more taxes than they would have otherwise paid had they filed a separate company tax return, and subsidiaries generating tax losses, if any, are paid for their losses when utilized.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The tax effect of temporary differences is accounted for in accordance with the rate-making treatment of the applicable regulatory commissions and relevant accounting authoritative literature. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the net accumulated deferred income tax obligations are as follows:\n2020 Federal Legislation: On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the $2.2 trillion bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Among other provisions, the CARES Act provides for loans and other benefits to small and large businesses, expanded unemployment insurance, direct payments to those with wages middle-income and below, new appropriations funding for health care and other priorities, and tax changes like deferrals of employer payroll tax liabilities coupled with an employee retention tax credit and rollbacks of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 limitations on net operating losses and certain business interest limitation. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we have recorded a tax liability of approximately $39 million related to the deferral of employer payroll tax liability provision. Fifty percent of the deferral of employer payroll tax liability must be paid by December 31, 2021 and the remaining amount by December 31, 2022. Other than the cash flow benefit described, the CARES Act did not have a material impact.\nOn December 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law H.R. 133, the \u201cConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.\u201d The House of Representatives and Senate previously passed the bill with overwhelming support. The legislation includes tax extenders as part of Division EE, the \u201cTaxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020.\u201d The provisions within the law include the extension of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar at 26 percent for facilities the construction of which begins through the end of 2022, at 22 percent for facilities the construction of which begins in 2023, and postponement of the date after which solar facilities placed in service receive only a 10 percent ITC to December 31, 2025, the extension of the ITC at 30 percent (with no phase-down) to offshore wind if construction begins by December 31, 2025 (qualifying offshore wind includes facilities located in the inland navigable waters or in the coastal waters of the U.S.), and the extension and expansion of the CARES Act employee retention tax credit for the period from January 1, 2021 through June 30, 2021, including increasing the credit rate from 50 percent to 70 percent of qualified wages, and increasing the per-employee creditable wages limit from $10,000 per year to $10,000 for each quarter. The tax credit provision impacts to Eversource are still being evaluated but are a significant positive development for the Company and provides the opportunity to generate additional tax credits in its renewable energy projects when the projects become operational.\nCarryforwards: The following table provides the amounts and expiration dates of state tax credit and loss carryforwards and federal tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards:\nIn 2020, the company increased its valuation allowance reserve for state credits by $10.3 million ($8.8 million for CL&P), net of tax, to reflect an update for expiring tax credits. In 2019, the Company increased its valuation allowance reserve for state credits by $18.5 million ($14.2 million for CL&P), net of tax, to reflect an update for expiring tax credits.\nFor 2020 and 2019, state credit and state loss carryforwards have been partially reserved by a valuation allowance of $48.3 million and $43.0 million (net of tax), respectively.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits: A reconciliation of the activity in unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized, is as follows:\nInterest and Penalties: Interest on uncertain tax positions is recorded and generally classified as a component of Other Interest Expense on the statements of income. However, when resolution of uncertainties results in the Company receiving interest income, any related interest benefit is recorded in Other Income, Net on the statements of income. No penalties have been recorded. The amount of interest expense/(income) on uncertain tax positions recognized and the related accrued interest payable/(receivable) are as follows:\nTax Positions: During 2020 and 2019, Eversource did not resolve any of its uncertain tax positions.\nOpen Tax Years: The following table summarizes Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, and PSNH's tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions as of December 31, 2020:\nEversource does not estimate to have an earnings impact related to unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months.\n13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nA. Environmental Matters\nEversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH are subject to environmental laws and regulations intended to mitigate or remove the effect of past operations and improve or maintain the quality of the environment. These laws and regulations require the removal or the remedy of the effect on the environment of the disposal or release of certain specified hazardous substances at current and former operating sites. Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH have an active environmental auditing and training program and each believes it is substantially in compliance with all enacted laws and regulations.\nEnvironmental reserves are accrued when assessments indicate it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. The approach used estimates the liability based on the most likely action plan from a variety of available remediation options, including no action required or several different remedies ranging from establishing institutional controls to full site remediation and monitoring. These liabilities are estimated on an undiscounted basis and do not assume that the amounts are recoverable from insurance companies or other third parties. The environmental reserves include sites at different stages of discovery and remediation and do not include any unasserted claims.\nThese reserve estimates are subjective in nature as they take into consideration several different remediation options at each specific site. The reliability and precision of these estimates can be affected by several factors, including new information concerning either the level of contamination at the site, the extent of Eversource's, CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's and PSNH's responsibility for remediation or the extent of remediation required, recently enacted laws and regulations or changes in cost estimates due to certain economic factors. It is possible that new information or future developments could require a reassessment of the potential exposure to required environmental remediation. As this information becomes available, management will continue to assess the potential exposure and adjust the reserves accordingly.\nThe amounts recorded as environmental reserves are included in Other Current Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities on the balance sheets and represent management's best estimate of the liability for environmental costs, and take into consideration site assessment, remediation and long-term monitoring costs. The environmental reserves also take into account recurring costs of managing hazardous substances and pollutants, mandated expenditures to remediate contaminated sites and any other infrequent and non-recurring clean-up costs. A reconciliation of the activity in the environmental reserves is as follows:\nThe number of environmental sites for which remediation or long-term monitoring, preliminary site work or site assessment is being performed are as follows:\nThe increase in the reserve balance was due primarily to the addition of nine MGP sites at the EGMA natural gas business resulting from the CMA acquisition and changes in cost estimates at the natural gas companies MGP sites and at CL&P for which additional remediation will be required.\nIncluded in the number of sites and reserve amounts above are former MGP sites that were operated several decades ago and manufactured natural gas from coal and other processes, which resulted in certain by-products remaining in the environment that may pose a potential risk to human health and the environment, for which Eversource may have potential liability. The reserve balances related to these former MGP sites were $92.2 million and $67.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and related primarily to the natural gas business segment.\nAs of December 31, 2020, for 6 environmental sites (1 for CL&P) that are included in the Company's reserve for environmental costs, the information known and the nature of the remediation options allow for the Company to estimate the range of losses for environmental costs. As of December 31, 2020, $41.7 million (including $0.9 million for CL&P) had been accrued as a liability for these sites, which represents the low end of the range of the liabilities for environmental costs. Management believes that additional losses of up to approximately $33 million ($0.5 million at CL&P) may be incurred in executing current remediation plans for these sites.\nAs of December 31, 2020, for 15 environmental sites (7 for CL&P and 2 for NSTAR Electric) that are included in the Company's reserve for environmental costs, management cannot reasonably estimate the exposure to loss in excess of the reserve, or range of loss, as these sites are under investigation and/or there is significant uncertainty as to what remedial actions, if any, the Company may be required to undertake. As of December 31, 2020, $17.5 million (including $2.6 million for CL&P and $0.4 million for NSTAR Electric) had been accrued as a liability for these sites. As of December 31, 2020, for the remaining 42 environmental sites (including 7 for CL&P, 10 for NSTAR Electric and 9 for PSNH) that are included in the Company's reserve for environmental costs, the $43.2 million accrual (including $8.8 million for CL&P, $4.3 million for NSTAR Electric and $7.1 million for PSNH) represents management's best estimate of the probable liability and no additional loss is anticipated at this time.\nPSNH, NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas have rate recovery mechanisms for MGP related environmental costs, therefore, changes in their respective environmental reserves do not impact Net Income. CL&P is allowed to defer certain environmental costs for future recovery. NSTAR Electric does not have a separate environmental cost recovery regulatory mechanism.\nB. Long-Term Contractual Arrangements\nEstimated Future Annual Costs: The estimated future annual costs of significant executed, non-cancelable, long-term contractual arrangements in effect as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\nRenewable Energy: Renewable energy contracts include non-cancellable commitments under contracts of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH for the purchase of energy and capacity from renewable energy facilities. Such contracts extend through 2041 for both CL&P and NSTAR Electric and 2033 for PSNH.\nAs required by 2018 regulation, CL&P and UI entered into ten-year contracts to purchase a combined total of approximately 9 million MWh annually from the Millstone Nuclear Power Station generation facility. On March 15, 2019, CL&P and UI each signed a ten-year contract with the owner of Millstone Nuclear Power Station in order to purchase a combined amount of approximately 50 percent of the facility's output (approximately 40 percent by CL&P). The Millstone Nuclear Power Station has a 2,112 MW nameplate capacity. PURA approved the contracts on September 18, 2019. Energy deliveries and payments under these contracts began in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nCL&P and UI were also required by 2018 regulation to enter into eight-year contracts to purchase a combined amount of approximately 18 percent of the facility's output (approximately 15 percent by CL&P) from the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant beginning January 1, 2022. The Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant has an approximate 1,250 MW nameplate capacity. On November 22, 2019, CL&P and UI each signed an eight-year contract with the owner of the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant. PURA approved the contracts on November 27, 2019.\nThe total estimated future cost of the Millstone Nuclear Power Station and Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant energy purchase contracts are $3.6 billion and are reflected in the table above. CL&P sells the energy purchased under these contracts into the market and uses the proceeds from these energy sales to offset the contract costs. As the net costs under these contracts are recovered from customers in future rates, the contracts do not have an impact on the net income of CL&P. These contracts do not meet the definition of a derivative, and accordingly, the costs of these contracts are being accounted for as incurred.\nExcluded from the table above are long-term commitments of NSTAR Electric pertaining to the Massachusetts Clean Energy 83D contract, for which construction had not commenced by December 31, 2020. Estimated costs under this contract are expected to begin in 2023 and range between $150 million and $415 million per year under a 20-year contract, totaling approximately $6.7 billion.\nThe contractual obligations table above does not include long-term commitments signed by CL&P and NSTAR Electric, as required by the PURA and DPU, respectively, for the purchase of renewable energy and related products that are contingent on the future construction of energy facilities.\nNatural Gas Procurement: Eversource's natural gas distribution businesses have long-term contracts for the purchase, transportation and storage of natural gas as part of its portfolio of supplies, which extend through 2045. Long-term purchases for natural gas procurement include contracts of EGMA, which was formed as a result of the CMA asset acquisition.\nPurchased Power and Capacity: These contracts include capacity CfDs of CL&P through 2026, and various IPP contracts or purchase obligations for electricity which extend through 2024 for CL&P, 2031 for NSTAR Electric and 2023 for PSNH.\nCL&P, along with UI, has three capacity CfDs consisting of two generation units and one demand response project. The combined capacities of these contracts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 675 MW and 676 MW, respectively. The capacity CfDs extend through 2026 and obligate both CL&P and UI to make or receive payments on a monthly basis to or from the generation facilities based on the difference between a set contractual capacity price and the capacity market prices received by the generation facilities in the ISO-NE capacity markets. CL&P has a sharing agreement with UI, whereby UI shares 20 percent of the costs and benefits of these contracts. CL&P's portion of the costs and benefits of these contracts will be paid by, or refunded to, CL&P's customers.\nThe contractual obligations table above does not include CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's or PSNH's standard/basic service contracts for the purchase of energy supply, the amounts of which vary with customers' energy needs.\nPeaker CfDs: CL&P, along with UI, has three peaker CfDs for a total of approximately 500 MW of peaking capacity through 2042. CL&P has a sharing agreement with UI, whereby CL&P is responsible for 80 percent and UI for 20 percent of the net costs or benefits of these CfDs. The Peaker CfDs pay the generation facility owner the difference between capacity, forward reserve and energy market revenues and a cost-of-service payment stream for 30 years. The ultimate cost or benefit to CL&P under these contracts will depend on the costs of plant operation and the prices that the projects receive for capacity and other products in the ISO-NE markets. CL&P's portion of the amounts paid or received under the Peaker CfDs are recovered from, or refunded to, CL&P's customers.\nTransmission Support Commitments: Along with other New England utilities, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH entered into a series of agreements in the 1980\u2019s to support the costs of, and receive rights to use, transmission and terminal facilities that were built to import electricity from the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec system in Canada. CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH were obligated to pay, over a 30-year period ending in 2020, their proportionate shares of the annual operation and maintenance expenses and capital costs of those facilities. On December 18, 2020, the parties to these agreements submitted to FERC an offer of settlement and amendments to these agreements implementing the terms of an extension for an additional 20-year period. The parties have requested these terms to be placed in effect as of January 1, 2021 or such other date as authorized by FERC. The estimated future annual costs included in the contractual obligations table above, are subject to the approval of these amendments by FERC and can vary as a result.\nThe total costs incurred under these agreements were as follows:\nC. Spent Nuclear Fuel Obligations - Yankee Companies\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH have plant closure and fuel storage cost obligations to the Yankee Companies, which have each completed the physical decommissioning of their respective nuclear power facilities and are now engaged in the long-term storage of their spent fuel. The Yankee Companies fund these costs through litigation proceeds received from the DOE and, to the extent necessary, through wholesale, FERC-approved rates charged under power purchase agreements with several New England utilities, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH. CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, in turn recover these costs from their customers through state regulatory commission-approved retail rates. The Yankee Companies collect amounts that management believes are adequate to recover the remaining plant closure and fuel storage cost estimates for the respective plants. Management believes CL&P and NSTAR Electric will recover their shares of these obligations from their customers. PSNH has recovered its total share of these costs from its customers.\nSpent Nuclear Fuel Litigation:\nThe Yankee Companies have filed complaints against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims seeking monetary damages resulting from the DOE's failure to accept delivery of, and provide for a permanent facility to store, spent nuclear fuel pursuant to the terms of the 1983 spent fuel and high-level waste disposal contracts between the Yankee Companies and the DOE. The court previously awarded the Yankee Companies damages for Phases I, II and III of litigation resulting from the DOE's failure to meet its contractual obligations. These Phases covered damages incurred in the years 1998 through 2012, and the awarded damages have been received by the Yankee Companies with certain amounts of the damages refunded to their customers.\nDOE Phase IV Damages - On May 22, 2017, each of the Yankee Companies filed a fourth set of lawsuits against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. The Yankee Companies sought monetary damages totaling $104.4 million for CYAPC, YAEC and MYAPC, resulting from the DOE's failure to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel for disposal covering the years from 2013 to 2016 (DOE Phase IV). On February 21, 2019, the Yankee Companies received a partial summary judgment and partial final judgment in their favor for the undisputed amount of monetary damages of $103.2 million. The court awarded CYAPC, YAEC and MYAPC damages of $40.7 million, $28.1 million and $34.4 million, respectively. The DOE did not appeal the court's judgment and the decision became final on April 23, 2019. On June 12, 2019, each of the Yankee Companies received the damages proceeds. On June 12, 2019, the court accepted an offer of judgment in the amount of $0.5 million to settle the disputed amount of approximately $1 million in Phase IV contested damages. The Yankee Companies received the $0.5 million payment in July 2019.\nIn September 2019, the Yankee Companies made a required informational filing with FERC as to the use of proceeds, for which approval was received in the fourth quarter of 2019. In December 2019, YAEC and MYAPC returned proceeds of $5.4 million and $21.0 million, respectively, to its member companies, of which the Eversource utilities (CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH) received a total of $2.8 million from YAEC and $5.0 million from MYAPC. The Eversource utilities refund these amounts received to their utility customers. Also, in December 2019, CYAPC paid $29.0 million to the DOE to partially settle its pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel obligation.\nD. Guarantees and Indemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, Eversource parent provides credit assurances on behalf of its subsidiaries, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, in the form of guarantees. Management does not anticipate a material impact to net income or cash flows as a result of these various guarantees and indemnifications.\nGuarantees issued on behalf of unconsolidated entities, including equity method offshore wind investments, for which Eversource parent is the guarantor, are recorded at fair value as a liability on the balance sheet at the inception of the guarantee. Eversource regularly reviews performance risk under these guarantee arrangements, and in the event it becomes probable that Eversource parent will be required to perform under the guarantee, the amount of probable payment will be recorded. The fair value of guarantees issued on behalf of unconsolidated entities are recorded within Other Long-Term Liabilities on the balance sheet, and was $0.5 million as of December 31, 2020.\nThe following table summarizes Eversource parent's exposure to guarantees and indemnifications of its subsidiaries and affiliates to external parties as of December 31, 2020:\n(1) Eversource parent issued guarantees on behalf of its 50 percent-owned affiliate, North East Offshore LLC (NEO), under which Eversource parent agreed to guarantee 50 percent of NEO\u2019s performance of obligations under certain purchase agreements with third-party contactors, in an amount not to exceed $1.3 billion with an expiration date in 2025. Eversource parent also issued a separate guarantee to \u00d8rsted on behalf of NEO, under which Eversource parent agreed to guarantee 50 percent of NEO\u2019s payment obligations under certain offshore wind project construction-related agreements with \u00d8rsted in an aggregate amount not to exceed $62.5 million. Any amounts paid under this guarantee to \u00d8rsted will count toward, but not increase, the maximum amount of the Funding Guarantee described in Note 2, below. The guarantee expires upon the full performance of the guaranteed obligations.\n(2) Eversource parent issued a guarantee (Funding Guarantee) on behalf of Eversource Investment LLC (EI), its wholly-owned subsidiary that holds a 50 percent ownership interest in NEO, under which Eversource parent agreed to guarantee certain funding obligations and certain indemnification payments of EI under the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of NEO, in an amount not to exceed $910 million. The guaranteed obligations include payment of EI's funding obligations during the construction phase of NEO\u2019s underlying offshore wind projects and indemnification obligations associated with third party credit support for its investment in NEO. Eversource parent\u2019s obligations under the Funding Guarantee expire upon the full performance of the guaranteed obligations.\n(3) On October 25, 2019, Eversource parent issued a guarantee on behalf of its 50 percent-owned affiliate, Sunrise Wind LLC, whereby Eversource parent will guarantee Sunrise Wind LLC's performance of certain obligations, in an amount not to exceed $15.4 million, under the Offshore Wind Renewable Energy Certificate Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Agreement). The Agreement was executed on October 23, 2019, by and between the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and Sunrise Wind LLC. The guarantee expires upon the full performance of the guaranteed obligations.\n(4) Surety bond expiration dates reflect termination dates, the majority of which will be renewed or extended. Certain surety bonds contain credit ratings triggers that would require Eversource parent to post collateral in the event that the unsecured debt credit ratings of Eversource parent are downgraded.\nLetter of Credit: On September 16, 2020, Eversource parent entered into a guarantee on behalf of Eversource Investment LLC, which holds Eversource's investments in offshore wind-related equity method investments, under which Eversource parent would guarantee Eversource Investment LLC's obligations under a letter of credit facility with a financial institution that Eversource Investment LLC may request in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $25 million.\nE. FERC ROE Complaints\nFour separate complaints were filed at the FERC by combinations of New England state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, consumer advocates, consumer groups, municipal parties and other parties (collectively, the Complainants). In each of the first three complaints, filed on October 1, 2011, December 27, 2012, and July 31, 2014, respectively, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE of 11.14 percent that had been utilized since 2005 and sought an order to reduce it prospectively from the date of the final FERC order and for the separate 15-month complaint periods. In the fourth complaint, filed April 29, 2016, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE billed of 10.57 percent and the maximum ROE for transmission incentive (incentive cap) of 11.74 percent, asserting that these ROEs were unjust and unreasonable.\nThe ROE originally billed during the period October 1, 2011 (beginning of the first complaint period) through October 15, 2014 consisted of a base ROE of 11.14 percent and incentives up to 13.1 percent. On October 16, 2014, the FERC set the base ROE at 10.57 percent and the incentive cap at 11.74 percent for the first complaint period. This was also effective for all prospective billings to customers beginning October 16, 2014. This FERC order was vacated on April 14, 2017 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the Court).\nAll amounts associated with the first complaint period have been refunded, which totaled $38.9 million (pre-tax and excluding interest) at Eversource and reflected both the base ROE and incentive cap prescribed by the FERC order. The refund consisted of $22.4 million for CL&P, $13.7 million for NSTAR Electric and $2.8 million for PSNH.\nEversource has recorded a reserve of $39.1 million (pre-tax and excluding interest) for the second complaint period as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. This reserve represents the difference between the billed rates during the second complaint period and a 10.57 percent base ROE and 11.74 percent incentive cap. The reserve consisted of $21.4 million for CL&P, $14.6 million for NSTAR Electric and $3.1 million for PSNH as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nOn October 16, 2018, FERC issued an order on all four complaints describing how it intends to address the issues that were remanded by the Court. FERC proposed a new framework to determine (1) whether an existing ROE is unjust and unreasonable and, if so, (2) how to calculate a replacement ROE. Initial briefs were filed by the NETOs, Complainants and FERC Trial Staff on January 11, 2019 and reply briefs were filed on March 8, 2019. The NETOs' brief was supportive of the overall ROE methodology determined in the October 16, 2018 order provided the FERC does not change the proposed methodology or alter its implementation in a manner that has a material impact on the results.\nThe FERC order included illustrative calculations for the first complaint using FERC's proposed frameworks with financial data from that complaint. Those illustrative calculations indicated that for the first complaint period, for the NETOs, which FERC concludes are of average financial risk, the preliminary just and reasonable base ROE is 10.41 percent and the preliminary incentive cap on total ROE is 13.08 percent.\nIf the results of the illustrative calculations were included in a final FERC order for each of the complaint periods, then a 10.41 percent base ROE and a 13.08 percent incentive cap would not have a significant impact on our financial statements for all of the complaint periods. These preliminary calculations are not binding and do not represent what we believe to be the most likely outcome of a final FERC order.\nOn November 21, 2019, FERC issued Opinion No. 569 affecting the two pending transmission ROE complaints against the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) transmission owners, in which FERC adopted a new methodology for determining base ROEs. Various parties sought rehearing. On December 23, 2019, the NETOs filed supplementary materials in the NETOs' four pending cases to respond to this new methodology because of the uncertainty of the applicability to the NETOs' cases.\nOn May 21, 2020, the FERC issued its order in Opinion No. 569-A on the rehearing of the MISO transmission owners' cases, in which FERC again changed its methodology for determining the MISO transmission owners' base ROEs. Various parties appealed the MISO transmission owners' opinion. On November 19, 2020, the FERC issued Opinion No. 569-B denying rehearing of Opinion No. 569-A and reaffirmed the methodology previously adopted in Opinion No. 569-A. The new methodology differs significantly from the methodology proposed by FERC in its October 16, 2018 order to determine the NETOs' base ROEs in its four pending cases.\nGiven the significant uncertainty regarding the applicability of the FERC opinions in the MISO transmission owners' two complaint cases to the NETOs' pending four complaint cases, Eversource concluded that there is no reasonable basis for a change to the reserve or recognized ROEs for any of the complaint periods at this time. As well, Eversource cannot reasonably estimate a range of any gain or loss for any of the four complaint proceedings at this time.\nEversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH currently record revenues at the 10.57 percent base ROE and incentive cap at 11.74 percent established in the October 16, 2014 FERC order.\nA change of 10 basis points to the base ROE used to establish the reserves would impact Eversource\u2019s after-tax earnings by an average of approximately $3 million for each of the four 15-month complaint periods.\nF. Eversource and NSTAR Electric Boston Harbor Civil Action\nIn 2016, the United States Attorney on behalf of the United States Army Corps of Engineers filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against NSTAR Electric, HEEC, and the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (together with NSTAR Electric and HEEC, the \"Defendants\"). The action alleged that the Defendants failed to comply with certain permitting requirements related to the placement of the HEEC-owned electric distribution cable beneath Boston Harbor.\nThe parties reached a settlement pursuant to which HEEC agreed to install a new 115kV distribution cable across Boston Harbor to Deer Island, utilizing a different route, and remove portions of the existing cable. Construction of the new distribution cable was completed in August 2019 and removal of the portions of the existing cable was completed in January 2020. All issues surrounding the current permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers are expected to be resolved, and subsequently, such litigation then dismissed with prejudice.\nNSTAR Electric agreed to provide a rate base credit of $17.5 million to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority for the new cable. This negotiated credit resulted in the initial $17.5 million of construction costs on the new cable being expensed as incurred, all of which was fully expensed in 2018. In connection with the new cable that was placed into service, a corresponding ARO was recognized for approximately $32 million within Other Long-Term Liabilities on the Eversource and NSTAR Electric balance sheets as of December 31, 2019.\nG. Litigation and Legal Proceedings\nEversource, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, are involved in legal, tax and regulatory proceedings regarding matters arising in the ordinary course of business, which involve management's assessment to determine the probability of whether a loss will occur and, if probable, its best estimate of probable loss. The Company records and discloses losses when these losses are probable and reasonably estimable, and discloses matters when losses are probable but not estimable or when losses are reasonably possible. Legal costs related to the defense of loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.\n14. LEASES\nEversource, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, has entered into lease agreements as a lessee for the use of land, office space, service centers, vehicles, information technology, and equipment. These lease agreements are classified as either finance or operating leases and the liability and right-of-use asset are recognized on the balance sheet at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nEversource determines whether or not a contract contains a lease based on whether or not it provides Eversource with the use of a specifically identified asset for a period of time, as well as both the right to direct the use of that asset and receive the significant economic benefits of the asset. Eversource has elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components and instead to account for both as a single lease component, with the exception of the information technology asset class where the lease and non-lease components are separated.\nThe provisions of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH lease agreements contain renewal options. The renewal options range from one year to twenty years. The renewal period is included in the measurement of the lease liability if it is reasonably certain that Eversource will exercise these renewal options.\nFor leases entered into or modified after the January 1, 2019 implementation date, the discount rate utilized for classification and measurement purposes as of the inception date of the lease is based on each company's collateralized incremental interest rate to borrow over a comparable term for an individual lease because the rate implicit in the lease is not determinable.\nCL&P and PSNH entered into certain contracts for the purchase of energy that qualify as leases. These contracts do not have minimum lease payments and therefore are not recognized as a lease liability on the balance sheet and are not reflected in the future minimum lease payments table below. Expense related to these contracts is included as variable lease cost in the table below. The expense and long-term obligation for these contracts are also included in Note 13B, \"Commitments and Contingencies - Long-Term Contractual Arrangements,\" to the financial statements.\nThe components of lease cost, prior to amounts capitalized, are as follows:\nOperating lease rental payments charged to expense in 2018 (which exclude CL&P's and PSNH's energy purchase contracts) were as follows:\nOperating lease cost, net of the capitalized portion, is included in Operations and Maintenance (or Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission expense for transmission segment leases) on the statements of income. Amortization of finance lease assets is included in Depreciation on the statements of income. Interest expense on finance leases is included in Interest Expense on the statements of income.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases is as follows:\nThe finance lease payments that NSTAR Electric will make over the next twelve months are entirely interest-related, due to escalating payments. As such, none of the finance lease payments over the next twelve months will reduce the finance lease liability.\nOther information related to leases is as follows (in millions of dollars, unless otherwise noted):\nEversource also acquired $14.7 million of right-of-use assets in exchange for the assumption of new operating lease liabilities and $54.2 million of right-of-use assets in exchange for the assumption of new finance lease liabilities as a result of the CMA asset acquisition.\nFuture minimum lease payments, excluding variable costs, under long-term leases, as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\n15. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each of the following financial instruments:\nPreferred Stock, Long-Term Debt and Rate Reduction Bonds: The fair value of CL&P's and NSTAR Electric's preferred stock is based upon pricing models that incorporate interest rates and other market factors, valuations or trades of similar securities and cash flow projections. The fair value of long-term debt and RRB debt securities is based upon pricing models that incorporate quoted market prices for those issues or similar issues adjusted for market conditions, credit ratings of the respective companies and treasury benchmark yields. The fair values provided in the table below are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Carrying amounts and estimated fair values are as follows:\nDerivative Instruments and Marketable Securities: Derivative instruments and investments in marketable securities are carried at fair value. For further information, see Note 4, \"Derivative Instruments,\" and Note 5, \"Marketable Securities,\" to the financial statements.\nSee Note 1I, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Fair Value Measurements,\" for the fair value measurement policy and the fair value hierarchy.\n16. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS)\nThe changes in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) by component, net of tax, are as follows:\nDefined benefit plan OCI amounts before reclassifications relate to actuarial gains and losses that arose during the year and were recognized in AOCI. The unamortized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs on the defined benefit plans are amortized from AOCI into Other Income, Net over the average future employee service period, and are reflected in amounts reclassified from AOCI. The related tax effects of the defined benefit plan OCI amounts before reclassifications recognized in AOCI were net deferred tax assets of $6.0 million and $4.4 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and deferred tax liabilities of $0.2 million in 2018.\nThe following table sets forth the amounts reclassified from AOCI by component and the impacted line item on the statements of income:\n(1) These amounts are included in the computation of net periodic Pension, SERP and PBOP costs. See Note 1M, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Other Income, Net\" and Note 11A, \"Employee Benefits - Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension,\" for further information.\nAs of December 31, 2020, it is estimated that a pre-tax amount of $1.8 million ($0.5 million for NSTAR Electric and $1.3 million for PSNH) will be reclassified from AOCI as a decrease to Net Income over the next 12 months as a result of the amortization of the interest rate swap agreements which have been settled.\n17. DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS\nEversource parent's ability to pay dividends may be affected by certain state statutes, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay common dividends and the leverage restriction tied to its consolidated total debt to total capitalization ratio requirement in its revolving credit agreements. Pursuant to the joint revolving credit agreement of Eversource, CL&P, PSNH, NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas and Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut, the joint revolving credit agreement of Eversource and EGMA, and to the NSTAR Electric revolving credit agreement, each company is required to maintain consolidated total indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 65 percent at the end of each fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2020, all companies were in compliance with such covenant and in compliance with all such provisions of the revolving credit agreements that may restrict the payment of dividends as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Retained Earnings balances subject to dividend restrictions were $4.61 billion for Eversource, $2.17 billion for CL&P, $2.53 billion for NSTAR Electric and $615.0 million for PSNH as of December 31, 2020.\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH are subject to Section 305 of the Federal Power Act that makes it unlawful for a public utility to make or pay a dividend from any funds \"properly included in its capital account.\" Management believes that this Federal Power Act restriction, as applied to CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, would not be construed or applied by the FERC to prohibit the payment of dividends from retained earnings for lawful and legitimate business purposes. In addition, certain state statutes may impose additional limitations on such companies and on NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas, EGMA, Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut, Aquarion Water Company of Massachusetts and Aquarion Water Company of New Hampshire. Such state law restrictions do not restrict the payment of dividends from retained earnings or net income.\n18. COMMON SHARES\nThe following table sets forth the Eversource parent common shares and the shares of common stock of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH that were authorized and issued, as well as the respective per share par values:\nCommon Share Issuances and 2019 Forward Sale Agreement: On June 15, 2020, Eversource completed an equity offering of 6,000,000 common shares at a price per share of $86.26. Eversource used the net proceeds of this offering to fund a portion of the purchase of the assets of CMA that closed on October 9, 2020. The issuance of these common shares resulted in proceeds of $509.2 million, net of issuance costs.\nIn June 2019, Eversource completed an equity offering consisting of 5,980,000 common shares issued directly by the Company and 11,960,000 common shares issuable pursuant to a forward sale agreement with an investment bank. Under the forward sale agreement, 11,960,000 common shares were borrowed from third parties and sold by the underwriters. The forward sale agreement allowed Eversource, at its election and prior to May 29, 2020, to physically settle the forward sale agreement by issuing common shares in exchange for net proceeds at the then-applicable forward sale price specified by the agreement (initially, $71.48 per share) or, alternatively, to settle the forward sale agreement in whole or in part through the delivery or receipt of shares or cash. The forward sale price was subject to adjustment daily based on a floating interest rate factor and would decrease in respect of certain fixed amounts specified in the agreement, such as dividends.\nEversource issued 6,000,000 common shares under the forward sale agreement in December 2019. On March 23, 2020, Eversource physically settled a portion of the forward sale agreement by delivering 1,500,000 common shares in exchange for net proceeds of $105.7 million. Subsequently, on March 26, 2020, Eversource physically settled the remaining portion of the forward sale agreement by delivering 4,460,000 common shares in exchange for net proceeds of $314.1 million. The forward sale price used to determine the cash proceeds received by Eversource was calculated based on the initial forward sale price, as adjusted in accordance with the forward sale agreement.\nThe March and June 2020 common share issuances of 5,960,000 and 6,000,000, respectively, resulted in total proceeds of $929.0 million, net of issuance costs. The June and December 2019 common share issuances of 5,980,000 and 6,000,000, respectively, resulted in total proceeds of $852.3 million. These issuances were reflected in shareholders\u2019 equity and as financing activities on the statements of cash flows.\nIssuances of shares under the forward sale agreement were classified as equity transactions. Accordingly, no amounts relating to the forward sale agreement were recorded in the financial statements until settlements took place. Prior to any settlements, the only impact of the forward sale agreement to the financial statements was the inclusion of incremental shares within the calculation of diluted EPS using the treasury stock method. See Note 21, \"Earnings Per Share,\" to the financial statements for information on the forward sale agreement\u2019s impact on the calculation of diluted EPS.\nEversource used the net proceeds received from the direct issuance of common shares and the net proceeds received from settlement of the forward sale agreement to repay short-term debt under the commercial paper program, to partially fund the purchase of the assets of CMA, to fund capital spending and clean energy initiatives, and for general corporate purposes.\nTreasury Shares: As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 14,864,379 and 15,977,757 Eversource common shares held as treasury shares, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were 342,954,023 and 329,880,645 Eversource common shares outstanding, respectively.\nEversource issues treasury shares to satisfy awards under the Company's incentive plans, shares issued under the dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan, and matching contributions under the Eversource 401k Plan. The issuance of treasury shares represents a non-cash transaction, as the treasury shares were used to fulfill Eversource's obligations that require the issuance of common shares.\n19. PREFERRED STOCK NOT SUBJECT TO MANDATORY REDEMPTION\nThe CL&P and NSTAR Electric preferred stock is not subject to mandatory redemption and is presented as a noncontrolling interest of a subsidiary in Eversource's financial statements.\nCL&P is authorized to issue up to 9,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $50 per share, and NSTAR Electric is authorized to issue 2,890,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $100 per share. Holders of preferred stock of CL&P and NSTAR Electric are entitled to receive cumulative dividends in preference to any payment of dividends on the common stock. Upon liquidation, holders of preferred stock of CL&P and NSTAR Electric are entitled to receive a liquidation preference before any distribution to holders of common stock in an amount equal to the par value of the preferred stock plus accrued and unpaid dividends. If the net assets were to be insufficient to pay the liquidation preference in full, then the net assets would be distributed ratably to all holders of preferred stock. The preferred stock of CL&P and NSTAR Electric is subject to optional redemption by the CL&P and NSTAR Electric Boards of Directors at any time.\nDetails of preferred stock not subject to mandatory redemption are as follows (in millions, except in redemption price and shares):\n20. COMMON SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\nDividends on the preferred stock of CL&P and NSTAR Electric totaled $7.5 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. These dividends were presented as Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests on the Eversource statements of income. Noncontrolling Interest - Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries on the Eversource balance sheets totaled $155.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. On the Eversource balance sheets, Common Shareholders' Equity was fully attributable to Eversource parent and Noncontrolling Interest - Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries was fully attributable to the noncontrolling interest.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, there was no change in ownership of the common equity of CL&P and NSTAR Electric.\n21. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic EPS is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted EPS is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the potential dilutive effect of certain share-based compensation awards and the equity forward sale agreement, as if they were converted into outstanding common shares. The dilutive effect of unvested RSU and performance share awards, as well as the equity forward sale agreement, is calculated using the treasury stock method. RSU and performance share awards are included in basic weighted average common shares outstanding as of the date that all necessary vesting conditions have been satisfied.\nAs described in Note 18, \"Common Shares,\" earnings per share dilution, if any, related to the forward sale agreement is determined under the treasury stock method until settlement of the forward sale agreement. Under this method, the number of Eversource common shares used in calculating diluted EPS is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares that would be issued upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreement less the number of shares that would be purchased by Eversource in the market (based on the average market price during the same reporting period) using the proceeds receivable upon settlement (based on the adjusted forward sale price at the end of that reporting period). Share dilution occurs when the average market price of Eversource's common shares is higher than the adjusted forward sale price. Eversource physically settled all remaining shares under the forward sale agreement as of March 26, 2020.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, there were 39,560 antidilutive share awards excluded from the EPS computation, as their impact would have been antidilutive. Antidilutive shares pertained to a purchase option extended to underwriters in connection with Eversource's common share issuance on June 15, 2020. See Note 18, \"Common Shares,\" for further information. There were no antidilutive share awards excluded from the computation for the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nThe following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted EPS:\n22. REVENUES\nRevenue is recognized when promised goods or services (referred to as performance obligations) are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. A five-step model is used for recognizing and measuring revenue from contracts with customers, which includes identifying the contract with the customer, identifying the performance obligations promised within the contract, determining the transaction price (the amount of consideration to which the company expects to be entitled), allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations and recognizing revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe following tables present operating revenues disaggregated by revenue source:\nRetail Tariff Sales: Regulated utilities provide products and services to their regulated customers under rates, pricing, payment terms and conditions of service, regulated by each state regulatory agency. The arrangement whereby a utility provides commodity service to a customer for a price approved by the respective state regulatory commission is referred to as a tariff sale contract, and the tariff governs all aspects of the provision of regulated services by utilities. The majority of revenue for Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH is derived from regulated retail tariff sales for the sale and distribution of electricity, natural gas and water to residential, commercial and industrial retail customers.\nThe utility's performance obligation for the regulated tariff sales is to provide electricity, natural gas or water to the customer as demanded. The promise to provide the commodity represents a single performance obligation, as it is a promise to transfer a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Revenue is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the utility, and the utility satisfies its performance obligation. Revenue is recognized based on the output method as there is a directly observable output to the customer (electricity, natural gas or water units delivered to the customer and immediately consumed). Each Eversource utility is entitled to be compensated for performance completed to date (service taken by the customer) until service is terminated.\nIn regulated tariff sales, the transaction prices are the rates approved by the respective state regulatory commissions. In general, rates can only be changed through formal proceedings with the state regulatory commissions. These rates are designed to recover the costs to provide service to customers and include a return on investment. Regulatory commission-approved tracking mechanisms are included in these rates and are also used to recover, on a fully-reconciling basis, certain costs, such as the procurement of energy supply, retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, net metering for distributed generation, and restructuring and stranded costs. These tracking mechanisms result in rates being changed periodically to ensure recovery of actual costs incurred.\nCustomers may elect to purchase electricity from each Eversource electric utility or may contract separately with a competitive third party supplier. Revenue is not recorded for the sale of the electricity commodity to customers who have contracted separately with these suppliers, only the delivery to a customer, as the utility is acting as an agent on behalf of the third party supplier.\nWholesale Transmission Revenues: The Eversource electric transmission-owning companies (CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH) each own and maintain transmission facilities that are part of an interstate power transmission grid over which electricity is transmitted throughout New England. CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, as well as most other New England utilities, are parties to a series of agreements that provide for coordinated planning and operation of the region's transmission facilities and the rules by which they acquire transmission services. The Eversource electric transmission-owning companies have a combination of FERC-approved regional and local formula rates that work in tandem to recover all their transmission costs. These rates are part of the ISO-NE Tariff. Regional rates recover the costs of higher voltage transmission facilities that benefit the region and are collected from all New England transmission customers, including the Eversource distribution businesses. Eversource's local rates recover the companies' total transmission revenue requirements, less revenues received from regional rates and other sources, and are collected from Eversource's distribution businesses and other transmission customers. The distribution businesses of Eversource, in turn, recover the FERC approved charges from retail customers through annual or semiannual tracking mechanisms, which are retail tariff sales.\nThe utility's performance obligation for regulated wholesale transmission sales is to provide transmission services to the customer as demanded. The promise to provide transmission service represents a single performance obligation. The transaction prices are the transmission rate formulas as defined by the ISO-NE Tariff and are regulated and established by FERC. Wholesale transmission revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligation is completed, which occurs as transmission services are provided to customers. The revenue is recognized based on the output method. Each Eversource utility is entitled to be compensated for performance completed to date (e.g., use of the transmission system by the customer).\nWholesale Market Sales Revenues: Wholesale market sales transactions include sales of energy and energy-related products into the ISO-NE wholesale electricity market, sales of natural gas to third party marketers, and also the sale of RECs to various counterparties. ISO-NE oversees the region's wholesale electricity market and administers the transactions and terms and conditions, including payment terms, which are established in the ISO-NE tariff, between the buyers and sellers in the market. Pricing is set by the wholesale market. The wholesale transactions in the ISO-NE market occur on a day-ahead basis or a real-time basis (daily) and are, therefore, short-term. Transactions are tracked and reported by ISO-NE net by the hour, which is the net hourly position of energy sales and purchases by each market participant. The performance obligation for ISO-NE energy transactions is defined to be the net by hour transaction. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation for these energy sales transactions is satisfied, when the sale occurs and the energy is transferred to the customer. For sales of natural gas, transportation, and natural gas pipeline capacity to third party marketers, revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time the sale occurs and the natural gas or related product is transferred to the marketer. RECs are sold to various counterparties, and revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied upon transfer of title to the customer through the New England Power Pool Generation Information System.\nOther Revenues from Contracts with Customers: Other revenues from contracts with customers primarily include property rentals that are not deemed leases. These revenues are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over time as the service is provided to the customer. Other revenues also include revenues from Eversource's service company, which is eliminated in consolidation.\nAmortization of/(Reserve for) Revenues Subject to Refund: Eversource has recorded a regulatory liability, recorded as a reduction to revenues, to reflect the difference between the 35 percent federal corporate income tax rate included in rates charged to customers and the 21 percent federal corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, until rates billed to customers reflect the lower federal tax rate. The Connecticut water business has not yet reflected the change in the federal corporate income tax rate in distribution rates and continues to accrue the regulatory liability. CL&P and Yankee Gas each have fully refunded this regulatory liability by the end of 2018 and 2020, respectively, and in 2019, PSNH began to refund this regulatory liability to customers in rates. NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas were not required to make refunds to customers for the higher federal corporate income tax rate billed to customers in the period between January 1, 2018 to the effective dates of each company's 2018 rate changes. EGMA will begin refunding this amount in November 2021.\nAlternative Revenue Programs: In accordance with accounting guidance for rate-regulated operations, certain of Eversource's utilities' rate making mechanisms qualify as alternative revenue programs (ARPs) if they meet specified criteria, in which case revenues may be recognized prior to billing based on allowed levels of collection in rates. Eversource's utility companies recognize revenue and record a regulatory asset or liability once the condition or event allowing for the automatic adjustment of future rates occurs. ARP revenues include both the recognition of the deferral adjustment to ARP revenues, when the regulator-specified condition or event allowing for additional billing or refund has occurred, and an equal and offsetting reversal of the ARP deferral to revenues as those amounts are reflected in the price of service in subsequent periods.\nEversource\u2019s ARPs include the revenue decoupling mechanism and the annual reconciliation adjustment to transmission formula rates, described below.\n\u2022Certain Eversource electric, natural gas and water companies, including CL&P and NSTAR Electric, have revenue decoupling mechanisms approved by a regulatory commission (decoupled companies). Decoupled companies\u2019 distribution revenues are not directly based on sales volumes. The decoupled companies reconcile their annual base distribution rate recovery to pre-established levels of baseline distribution delivery service revenues, with any difference between the allowed level of distribution revenue and the actual amount realized adjusted through subsequent rates.\n\u2022\n\u2022The transmission formula rates provide for the annual reconciliation and recovery or refund of estimated costs to actual costs. The financial impacts of differences between actual and estimated costs are deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, transmission customers. This transmission deferral reconciles billed transmission revenues to the revenue requirement for our transmission businesses.\nOther Revenues: Other Revenues include certain fees charged to customers that are not considered revenue from contracts with customers. Other revenues also include lease revenues under lessor accounting guidance of $4.3 million ($0.8 million at CL&P and $2.7 million at NSTAR Electric) and $4.4 million ($1.0 million at CL&P and $2.7 million at NSTAR Electric) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIntercompany Eliminations: Intercompany eliminations are primarily related to the Eversource electric transmission revenues that are derived from ISO-NE regional transmission charges to the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH that recover the costs of the wholesale transmission business, and revenues from Eversource's service company. Intercompany revenues and expenses between the Eversource wholesale transmission businesses and the Eversource distribution businesses and from Eversource's service company are eliminated in consolidation and included in \"Eliminations\" in the table above.\nReceivables: Receivables, Net on the balance sheet include trade receivables from our retail customers and receivables arising from ISO-NE billing related to wholesale transmission contracts and wholesale market transactions, sales of natural gas and capacity to marketers, sales of RECs, and property rentals. In general, retail tariff customers and wholesale transmission customers are billed monthly and the payment terms are generally due and payable upon receipt of the bill.\nUnbilled Revenues: Unbilled Revenues on the balance sheet represent estimated amounts due from retail customers for electricity, natural gas or water delivered to customers but not yet billed. The utility company has satisfied its performance obligation and the customer has received and consumed the commodity as of the balance sheet date, and therefore, the utility company records revenue for those services in the period the services were provided. Only the passage of time is required before the company is entitled to payment for the satisfaction of the performance obligation. Payment from customers is due monthly as services are rendered and amounts are billed. Actual amounts billed to customers when meter readings become available may vary from the estimated amount.\nUnbilled revenues are recognized by allocating estimated unbilled sales volumes to the respective customer classes, and then applying an estimated rate by customer class to those sales volumes. Unbilled revenue estimates reflect seasonality, weather, customer usage patterns, customer rates in effect for customer classes, and the timing of customer billing. The companies that have a decoupling mechanism record a regulatory deferral to reflect the actual allowed amount of revenue associated with their respective decoupled distribution rate design.\nPractical Expedients: Eversource has elected practical expedients in the accounting guidance that allow the company to record revenue in the amount that the company has a right to invoice, if that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the company's performance to date, and not to disclose related unsatisfied performance obligations. Retail and wholesale transmission tariff sales fall into this category, as these sales are recognized as revenue in the period the utility provides the service and completes the performance obligation, which is the same as the monthly amount billed to customers. There are no other material revenue streams for which Eversource has unsatisfied performance obligations.\n23. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nEversource is organized into the Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution reportable segments and Other based on a combination of factors, including the characteristics of each segments' services, the sources of operating revenues and expenses and the regulatory environment in which each segment operates. These reportable segments represent substantially all of Eversource's total consolidated revenues. Revenues from the sale of electricity, natural gas and water primarily are derived from residential, commercial and industrial customers and are not dependent on any single customer. The Electric Distribution reportable segment includes the results of PSNH's generation facilities prior to sales in January and August 2018, and NSTAR Electric's solar power facilities. Eversource's reportable segments are determined based upon the level at which Eversource's chief operating decision maker assesses performance and makes decisions about the allocation of company resources.\nThe remainder of Eversource's operations is presented as Other in the tables below and primarily consists of 1) the equity in earnings of Eversource parent from its subsidiaries and intercompany interest income, both of which are eliminated in consolidation, and interest expense related to the debt of Eversource parent, 2) the revenues and expenses of Eversource Service, most of which are eliminated in consolidation, 3) the operations of CYAPC and YAEC, 4) Eversource Water Ventures, Inc., parent company of Aquarion, 5) the results of other unregulated subsidiaries, which are not part of its core business, and 6) Eversource parent's equity ownership interests that are not consolidated, which primarily include the offshore wind business, a natural gas pipeline owned by Enbridge, Inc., and a renewable energy investment fund.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Yankee Gas, NSTAR Gas and EGMA purchase natural gas transmission services from the Enbridge, Inc. natural gas pipeline project described above. These affiliate transaction costs total $77.7 million annually and are classified as Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission on the Eversource statements of income.\nEach of Eversource's subsidiaries, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, has one reportable segment.\nCash flows used for investments in plant included in the segment information below are cash capital expenditures that do not include amounts incurred but not paid, cost of removal, AFUDC related to equity funds, and the capitalized portions of pension and PBOP expense.\nEversource's segment information is as follows:\n(1) On October 9, 2020, Eversource completed the CMA asset acquisition, with Yankee Energy System, Inc. (Yankee parent) as the acquiring entity. Yankee parent is the parent company of Yankee Gas, NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Hopkinton LNG Corp. As a result of the acquisition, in the fourth quarter of 2020, our chief operating decision maker assessed the performance of the Natural Gas Distribution segment including Yankee parent. Previously, Yankee parent was presented within Other and its equity in earnings were eliminated in consolidation. Prior comparative periods were revised to conform to the current period segment presentation.\n24. ACQUISITION OF ASSETS OF COLUMBIA GAS OF MASSACHUSETTS\nOn October 9, 2020, Eversource acquired certain assets and liabilities that comprised NiSource\u2019s natural gas distribution business in Massachusetts, which was previously doing business as CMA, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement (the Agreement) entered into on February 26, 2020 between Eversource and NiSource Inc. (NiSource). The cash purchase price was $1.1 billion, plus a target working capital amount of $69.6 million, which is subject to adjustment to reflect actual working capital as of the closing date that has not yet been finalized. Eversource financed the acquisition through a combination of debt and equity issuances in a ratio that was consistent with our consolidated capital structure. The natural gas distribution assets acquired from CMA were assigned to EGMA, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Eversource formed in 2020. The LNG assets acquired from CMA were assigned to Hopkinton LNG Corp. EGMA distributes natural gas to approximately 332,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers with over 5,000 miles of natural gas distribution pipeline across more than 60 communities in Massachusetts, adding to the approximately 303,000 natural gas customers that Eversource already serves in Massachusetts.\nThe transaction required approval by the DPU, the Maine Public Utilities Commission, the FERC, and the Federal Communications Commission, and review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.\nThe liabilities assumed by Eversource under the Agreement specifically excluded any liabilities (past or future) arising out of, or related to, the fires and explosions that occurred on September 13, 2018 in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, Massachusetts related to the delivery of natural gas by CMA, including certain subsequent events, all as described and in the DPU's Order on Scope dated December 23, 2019 (D.P.U. 19-141) (the Greater Lawrence Incident or GLI). The liabilities assumed also excluded any further emergency events prior to the closing of the acquisition related to the restoration and reconstruction with respect to the GLI, including any losses arising out of, or related to, any litigation, demand, cause of action, claim, suit, investigation, proceeding, indemnification agreements or rights. Eversource did not assume any of CMA's or NiSource Inc.'s third party debt obligations or notes payable.\nRate Settlement Agreement: On October 7, 2020, the DPU approved a rate settlement agreement with Eversource, EGMA, NiSource, Bay State, the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, the DOER and the Low-Income Weatherization and Fuel Assistance Program Network, which requested approval of the February 26, 2020 Agreement, as well as a rate stabilization plan, among other items. The settlement agreement included an authorized regulatory ROE of 9.70 percent as of January 1, 2021, a 53.25 percent equity component of its capital structure, and established rate base equal to $995 million as of the closing on October 9, 2020.\nThe approved rate stabilization plan includes base distribution rate increases of $13 million on November 1, 2021 and $10 million on November 1, 2022. The settlement agreement includes two rate base resets during an eight-year rate plan, occurring on November 1, 2024 and November 1, 2027. The two rate base resets adjust distribution rates to account for capital additions (including the roll-in of GSEP capital additions), depreciation expense, property taxes, and return on rate base for capital additions placed into service through December 31, 2023, for the first rate base reset occurring on November 1, 2024, and through December 31, 2026, for the second rate base reset occurring on November 1, 2027. Notwithstanding the two distribution rate increases, the two rate base reset provisions, and potential adjustments for qualifying exogenous events, EGMA agreed not to file for an increase or redesign of distribution base rates effective prior to November 1, 2028.\nThe settlement agreement also permits EGMA to seek recovery of both transaction and integration costs as a result of the asset acquisition after December 31, 2026, subject to DPU review and approval, and subject to certain conditions, such as demonstrating savings resulting from the acquisition.\nPreliminary Purchase Price Allocation: The allocation of the total purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been determined based on the accounting guidance for fair value measurements, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe preliminary allocation of the cash purchase price as of October 9, 2020 is as follows:\nThe fair values of CMA's assets and liabilities were determined based on significant estimates and assumptions, including Level 3 inputs, that are judgmental in nature. The allocation of the total purchase price includes adjustments to reflect plant that will not earn a return and to reduce rate base to the allowed $995 million as specified in the rate settlement agreement. Eversource also recorded a $6.7 million liability for the future refund to customers for CMA's overcollection of the lower income tax rate beginning in 2018.\nThe excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill. The goodwill reflects the value paid by Eversource primarily for expanding its natural gas infrastructure within its existing jurisdiction. The goodwill resulting from the acquisition has been assigned to the Natural Gas Distribution reporting unit.\nUnder the terms of the settlement agreement, a portion of the proceeds of the sale due to NiSource was withheld and used to establish an Energy Relief Fund comprised of two components, an Arrearage Forgiveness Fund and a fund which is restricted for energy efficiency and clean energy measures in the Merrimack Valley. As a result, Eversource funded restricted cash accounts and established a liability totaling $56.8 million on the acquisition date. By December 31, 2020, $15.4 million of the Arrearage Forgiveness Fund was credited back to customers and the remainder was paid back to NiSource. The purchase price included in investing cash outflows on the statement of cash flows of $1.11 billion reflects the payment to NiSource, excluding the restricted cash funds.\nPro Forma Financial Information: The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the pro forma combined results of operations of Eversource and the CMA business acquired and reflects the amortization of purchase price adjustments assuming the acquisition had taken place on January 1, 2019. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations that would have been achieved or the future consolidated results of operations of Eversource. Pro forma net income excludes the impact of assets and liabilities not assumed by Eversource, such as amounts directly associated with the GLI incident, and non-recurring costs associated with the transaction.\nRevenues and Net Income: The impact of CMA on Eversource's accompanying consolidated statement of income included operating revenues of $154.8 million and net income attributable to common shareholders of $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTransactions recognized separately from the business combination: Eversource has entered into a Transition Services Agreement (TSA) with NiSource, under which NiSource is providing certain administrative functions. Eversource has recorded $15.9 million in Operating Expenses on the statement of income related to TSA and pre-TSA costs in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, Eversource recorded $2.0 million in Energy Efficiency expense related to the implementation of new energy efficiency programs as specified in the rate settlement agreement.\n25. GOODWILL\nIn a business combination, the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nis recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually and more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. In accordance with the accounting standards, if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value (including goodwill), the goodwill is tested for impairment. Goodwill is not subject to amortization, however is subject to a fair value based assessment for impairment at least annually and whenever facts or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment. A resulting write-down, if any, would be charged to Operating Expenses.\nEversource's reporting units for the purpose of testing goodwill are Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution. These reporting units are consistent with the operating segments underlying the reportable segments identified in Note 23, \"Segment Information,\" to the financial statements.\nEversource completed the CMA asset acquisition on October 9, 2020, resulting in the addition of approximately $42 million of goodwill, which was allocated to the Natural Gas Distribution reporting unit. On July 31, 2020, Eversource sold its water system and treatment plant that supplies water to the towns of Hingham, Hull and North Cohasset to the town of Hingham, Massachusetts, resulting in a reduction to goodwill of $23.6 million. This goodwill was previously reflected in the Water Distribution reporting unit.\nEversource completed its annual goodwill impairment test for Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution reporting units as of October 1, 2020 and determined that no impairment existed. There were no events subsequent to October 1, 2020 that indicated impairment of goodwill. The annual goodwill assessment included an evaluation of the Company's share price and credit ratings, analyst reports, financial performance, cost and risk factors, long-term strategy, growth and future projections, as well as macroeconomic, industry and market conditions. This evaluation required the consideration of several factors that impact the fair value of the reporting units, including conditions and assumptions that affect the future cash flows of the reporting units. Key considerations include discount rates, utility sector market performance and merger transaction multiples, and internal estimates of future cash flows and net income.\nThe following table presents goodwill by reportable segment:",

    "item_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nManagement, on behalf of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, is responsible for the preparation, integrity, and fair presentation of the accompanying Financial Statements and other sections of this combined Annual Report on Form 10-K. Eversource's internal controls over financial reporting were audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP.\nManagement, on behalf of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. The internal control framework and processes have been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. There are inherent limitations of internal controls over financial reporting that could allow material misstatements due to error or fraud to occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees during the normal course of business. Additionally, internal controls over financial reporting may become inadequate in the future due to changes in the business environment. Under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting was conducted based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation under the framework in COSO, management concluded that internal controls over financial reporting at Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH were effective as of December 31, 2020.\nManagement, on behalf of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, evaluated the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020 to determine whether they are effective in ensuring that the disclosure of required information is made timely and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations of the SEC. This evaluation was made under management's supervision and with management's participation, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There are inherent limitations of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumventing or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. The principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded, based on their review, that the disclosure controls and procedures of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and regulations and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nOn October 9, 2020, Eversource completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities that comprised NiSource\u2019s natural gas distribution business in Massachusetts (formerly Columbia Gas of Massachusetts (CMA)). The natural gas distribution assets acquired from CMA were assigned to EGMA and are part of the natural gas distribution segment. As of December 31, 2020, Eversource management has excluded EGMA from its evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and management\u2019s report on internal controls over financial reporting.\nThere have been no changes in internal controls over financial reporting for Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting.",

Executive Compensation\nEversource Energy\nThe information required by this Item 11 for Eversource Energy is incorporated herein by reference to certain information contained in Eversource Energy's definitive proxy statement for solicitation of proxies, which is expected to be filed with the SEC on or about March 26, 2021, under the sections captioned \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis,\u201d plus related subsections, and \u201cCompensation Committee Report,\u201d plus related subsections following such Report.\nNSTAR ELECTRIC and PSNH\nCertain information required by this Item 11 has been omitted for NSTAR Electric and PSNH pursuant to Instruction I(2)(c) to Form 10-K, Omission of Information by Certain Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries.\nCL&P\nThe information in this Item 11 relates solely to CL&P.\nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nCL&P is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eversource Energy. Its board of directors consists entirely of executive officers of Eversource Energy system companies. CL&P does not have a compensation committee, and the Compensation Committee of Eversource Energy's Board of Trustees determines compensation for the executive officers of CL&P, including their salaries, annual incentive awards and long-term incentive awards. All of CL&P\u2019s \u201cNamed Executive Officers,\u201d as defined below, also serve as officers of Eversource Energy and one or more other subsidiaries of Eversource Energy. Compensation set by the Compensation Committee of Eversource Energy (the Committee) and set forth herein is for services rendered to Eversource Energy and its subsidiaries by such officers in all capacities.\nThis Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) provides information about Eversource Energy\u2019s compensation principles, objectives, plans, policies and actions for the Named Executive Officers. The discussion describes the specific components used in Eversource Energy\u2019s compensation programs and approach to executive compensation, how Eversource Energy measures performance, and how Eversource Energy\u2019s compensation principles were applied to compensation awards and decisions that were made by the Compensation Committee for the Named Executive Officers, as presented in the tables and narratives that follow. Given the unprecedented events of the past year, this discussion also describes how Eversource Energy effectively responded to the COVID-19 pandemic to safeguard Eversource Energy\u2019s employees, customers and the communities that Eversource Energy serves, how the Compensation Committee considered the effects of the pandemic in its compensation decisions and how Eversource Energy worked to increase diversity in the workforce and raise awareness of the need for racial justice in our society. While this discussion focuses primarily on 2020 information, it also addresses decisions that were made in prior periods to the extent that these decisions are relevant to the full understanding of Eversource Energy\u2019s compensation programs and the decisions that were made regarding 2020 performance. The CD&A also contains an assessment of performance measured against established 2020 goals and additional accomplishments, the compensation awards made by the Compensation Committee, and other information relating to Eversource Energy\u2019s compensation programs, including:\n= Summary of 2020 Accomplishments = Elements of 2020 Compensation\n= Pay for Performance Philosophy = 2020 Annual Incentive Program Assessment\n= Executive Compensation Governance = Long-Term Incentive Program\n= Named Executive Officers = Clawback and No Hedging and No Pledging Policies\n= Overview of the Compensation Program = Share Ownership Guidelines and Retention Requirements\n= Market Analysis = Other Benefits\n= Mix of Compensation Elements = Contractual Agreements\n= Risk Analysis of Executive Compensation = Tax and Accounting Considerations\n= Results of 2020 Say on Pay Vote = Equity Grant Practices\nSummary of 2020 Accomplishments\n2020 and the COVID-19 Pandemic\nFrom the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Eversource Energy set out to continue to focus first and foremost on the safety and well-being of Eversource Energy stakeholders, to do for each of the groups noted below what Eversource Energy might be able to do in order to help them navigate through the effects of the pandemic and to assist Eversource Energy customers, employees, the people and organizations who live in and operate in the communities Eversource Energy serves, the society we live in, and you, Eversource Energy shareholders, in navigating the effects of the pandemic. Eversource Energy acted boldly and decisively as COVID-19 emerged as a public health crisis, and immediately implemented many changes to the way Eversource Energy conducts business, while continuing to remain focused on operational and financial performance.\nThe results and actions taken that Eversource Energy reports in this CD&A relate to 2020 performance in totality, some of which were specifically in response to the pandemic, and which have hopefully made living in a pandemic environment a little more tolerable. These include:\n\u2022For Eversource Energy customers - Eversource Energy took steps to ensure that any personal contact between Eversource Energy employees (both in the field and those working remotely) and customers was performed safely and in accordance with all public health guidelines to reduce to the greatest extent possible the risk of transmission of the virus. Eversource Energy restored service following a substantial number of storms in a safe and effective manner, instituted a voluntary moratorium on customer shutoffs for non-payment, and offered broad payment and arrearage forgiveness plans to provide assistance from the economic pressures impacting Eversource Energy customers. Eversource Energy also made communicating with the Company easier, including the implementation of a new 24-hour call center, a dedicated team set up to help small business customers apply for COVID-19 related federal assistance, and the continuation of industry-leading energy efficiency programs done by quickly moving to virtual energy audits.\n\u2022For Eversource Energy\u2019s communities - Eversource Energy continued support to communities through volunteer activity and virtual events, with employees contributing over 26,000 hours to volunteerism, and contributed $8.1 million in sponsoring or supporting the many events noted in this CD&A. Eversource Energy Sustainability accomplishments are making a difference in making Eversource Energy communities a healthier place to live. Please see the disclosures in the 2020 Sustainability/ESG section under the headings Community and Awards.\n\u2022For society - Beyond the pandemic, 2020 saw a heightened focus on the criticality of racial equity and justice. In response, Eversource Energy increased efforts to raise awareness of the need for social and racial justice along with related efforts to further diversity, equity\nand inclusion in the workplace and workforce and help support the vision for racial justice. Eversource Energy\u2019s racial equity task force, focused town hall discussions, and learning hub on racial and social justice speak to this commitment.\n\u2022For Eversource Energy\u2019s employees - Eversource Energy responded to the pandemic very quickly, taking the lead to implement work from home practices at the very beginning stage of the crisis, making numerous changes to work practices as a direct result of the pandemic, and continuing career development and company-paid educational opportunities for employees. Over 800 new Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts employees, formerly Columbia Gas of Massachusetts (Columbia Gas) employees, were successfully on-boarded. No employees, whether from Columbia Gas or otherwise, lost their jobs due to the pandemic. Eversource Energy has also continued open, regular and transparent communications with employees, and has worked in close communication and cooperation with union leadership to keep employees safe and help them continue to grow. The partnership with union leadership has been instrumental and essential in helping to deal with the many challenges of 2020.\nThe sections within this CD&A titled \u201c2020 Financial and Operational Accomplishments\u201d and \u201c2020 Annual Incentive Program Assessment\u201d provide additional information with respect to some of the other actions taken by Eversource throughout the year in response to the pandemic.\nChanges to 2021 Executive Compensation Programs\nDue to the hardships experienced by Eversource Energy\u2019s customers and communities as a result of COVID-19 and the extended outages that took place in CL&P\u2019s service territory in 2020 following Storm Isaias, and in spite of excellent overall performance by Eversource Energy\u2019s executives in 2020, the Compensation Committee determined that it would freeze base salaries for the senior executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, at 2020 levels, rather than provide market based base salary increases. In addition, in Eversource Energy\u2019s engagement sessions with shareholders, Eversource Energy received comments relative to the 50/50 mix of RSUs and Performance Shares in the long-term incentive program. As a result, the Committee revised the Performance Share Program in response to these shareholder comments and to further align Eversource Energy\u2019s compensation programs with the Committee\u2019s pay for performance philosophy, such that 75 percent of the 2021 - 2023 Program\u2019s long-term incentive opportunity will consist of Performance Shares and 25 percent will consist of RSUs.\n2020 Performance Assessment - COVID-19\nWith regard to the performance goals established by the Committee prior to the spread of the virus and whether changes to those goals should be considered as a result of the pandemic, the Committee discussed the established performance goals throughout its 2020 meetings, and concluded that it would not change them, as it determined that despite the additional challenges, the Operating Plan and related performance goals could still be executed under the direction and oversight of Eversource Energy\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and his executive team without revision.\n2020 Financial and Operational Accomplishments\nIn 2020, Eversource Energy continued to outperform its peers financially, strengthened its position as a leader in ESG, and met or exceeded all of the goals set by the Committee, all while keeping Eversource employees and customers safe. The following is a summary of some of the most important accomplishments in 2020:\n\u2022FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE: 2020 earnings per share equaled $3.55 per share, and non-GAAP earnings per share equaled $3.64; non-GAAP earnings excludes transactional costs relating to the highly successful acquisition in 2020 of the assets of Columbia Gas. 1\n1 Non-GAAP EPS presented in this Item 11 excludes the one-time transactional costs of $0.09 per share relating to the acquisition in 2020 of the assets of Columbia Gas. Eversource Energy uses this non-GAAP financial measure to more fully compare and explain 2020 results without including the impact of the transactional costs of the Columbia Gas acquisition. Due to the effect of the acquisition costs on net income attributable to common shareholders, management believes that the non-GAAP presentation is a more meaningful representation of Eversource Energy\u2019s financial performance and provides additional information to readers in analyzing historical and future performance of the business. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to Eversource Energy\u2019s consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders.\n\u2022DIVIDENDS PAID: The Board of Trustees increased the annual dividend rate by 6.1 percent for 2020 to $2.27 per share, which exceeded the median dividend growth rate of 4.5 percent for the utilities that constitute the Edison Electric Institute Index (EEI Utility Index).\n\u2022SHAREHOLDER RETURN: Eversource Energy\u2019s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) in 2020 was 4.5 percent, compared to negative 1.2 percent for the EEI Index, the 5th highest TSR in the EEI Utility Index of 39 companies. Eversource continued to outperform the EEI Utility Index over the last one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 over the last three- and 10-year periods. An investment of $1,000 in Eversource\u2019s common shares for the 10-year period beginning January 1, 2011 was worth $3,726 on December 31, 2020. The following chart represents the comparative total shareholder returns for the periods ended December 31, 2020:\n\u2022STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND REGULATORY OUTCOMES: Although Eversource Energy faced challenges caused by the restrictions resulting from the pandemic, Eversource completed the acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gas in seven months; the acquisition was immediately accretive to earnings and is expected to be increasingly so in future years. As part of the acquisition regulatory approval process, Eversource successfully reached a positive 8-year rate settlement agreement for the new entity, Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts. Eversource achieved constructive outcomes in the PSNH and NSTAR Gas subsidiary rate reviews, completed the sale by the Aquarion Water Company of assets located in Hingham, Massachusetts in satisfaction of a predecessor company agreement, and successfully executed several storm cost recovery proceedings in the three states Eversource serves.\n\u2022CREDIT RATING: Eversource Energy continues to hold an A- level Corporate Credit Rating at Standard & Poor\u2019s. There is no other holding company with a higher credit rating in the EEI Utility Index.\n\u2022RELIABILITY PERFORMANCE: Electric System Reliability, measured by months between interruptions, was top decile for the industry in 2020; customer power interruptions were on average 19.2 months apart.\n\u2022RESTORATION PERFORMANCE: The average system outage duration was 64.0 minutes, also top decile for the fastest restoration time.\n\u2022SAFETY: Eversource\u2019s safety performance was 0.7, measured by days away, restricted or transferred (DART) per 100 workers, which continued to outperform the industry in 2020. In addition to the safety performance as measured by DART, the policies and procedures established at the onset of the pandemic contributed significantly to the successful overall safety performance.\n\u2022GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE: On-time response to gas customer emergency calls was 99.6 percent, meeting the industry average.\n\u2022CUSTOMERS: Eversource continued to add to its customer messaging programs, including those relating to COVID-19, realized all-time highs in both digital messaging and estimated time-to-restore communications, led the industry in the early implementation of customer service termination moratoria, and implemented extended customer forgiveness and payment programs. However, Eversource acknowledged that as a result of Tropical Storm Isaias, which caused extensive, catastrophic damage to the CL&P distribution system and many prolonged outages, its customers and government leaders felt that the performance fell short of their expectations.\n\u2022CLEAN ENERGY LEADERSHIP: Regarding Eversource\u2019s offshore wind projects, Eversource continued to advance the New London State Pier project in Connecticut, giving the partnership access to the leading offshore wind port in the Northeast; reached a comprehensive settlement for the joint Eversource/\u00d8rsted South Fork project with the Town of East Hampton, New York and the Board of Trustees for South Fork relating to the installation of the onshore transmission facilities to be constructed in those two communities; and submitted Construction and Operating Plans with the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management for the joint Eversource/\u00d8rsted Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind projects. In June of 2020, Eversource began construction of a first in the nation community battery storage project at the Provincetown, Massachusetts town transfer station. Eversource\u2019s electric vehicle charging infrastructure program met its targets, Eversource led efforts to expand Massachusetts\u2019 utility scale solar program, and the energy efficiency programs, while slowed by the COVID-19 pandemic, continued to perform at a national leading level as rated by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.\n2020 Sustainability/ESG\n\u2022SUSTAINABILITY: Eversource\u2019s social and environmental accomplishments, which once again in 2020 received widespread recognition, are a measure of the strong commitment to corporate responsibility and are reflected in the high ratings from leading sustainability rating firms. In 2020, Eversource was ranked top quartile within a peer group of comparably sized U.S. utilities whose ESG performance is assessed by the two leading sustainability rating firms. Eversource also continued to take steps to implement and ensure progress towards its industry leading goal to be carbon neutral in their operations by 2030.\n\u2022COMMUNITY: Despite the challenges of the pandemic, Eversource continued to make a significant impact in the communities it serves through its corporate philanthropy programs and extensive employee volunteer programs. Eversource\u2019s employees devoted 26,000 hours in 2020 to volunteerism in the service territory communities, mostly all under constraints imposed by the pandemic. Eversource\u2019s 2020 charitable giving totaled $8.1 million, including a record amount in contributions by employees to the United Way along with major event lead sponsorships for the Eversource Walk for Children\u2019s Hospital of Boston, Eversource Walk and 5K Run for Easterseals New Hampshire, Mass General Cancer Center/Eversource Every Day Amazing Race, Eversource Hartford Marathon, Travelers Championship and Special Olympics in Connecticut and New Hampshire. Most of these events were held virtually, and many Eversource employees assisted in producing the events to help ensure their success. The Eversource Energy Foundation continues to provide direct support to organizations and large regional initiatives within Eversource\u2019s service territories. In addition, Eversource provided accelerated and targeted community support to COVID-19 relief organizations.\n\u2022DIVERSITY: Eversource continued to support many programs and agencies that address racial and ethnic disparities in our customers\u2019 communities and beyond. Eversource also continues to develop a workforce that fully reflects the diversity of the people and communities Eversource serves. Eversource\u2019s hiring practices emphasize diversity, and encourage employees to embrace different people, perspectives and experiences in our workplace and within our communities - regardless of their race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, gender identity, age, disability, marital status, sexual orientation, active military or veteran status. Eversource continued its successful drive to increase workforce diversity; in 2020, 47.6 percent of new hires and promotions into leadership roles were women or people of color. In addition, in response to the social unrest last year, Eversource conducted listening sessions with our business resource groups and established a racial equity task force. Eversource also started a highly attended employee town hall series focused on taking action to advance racial equality and to disrupt racism. In addition, Eversource launched a webinar series on employee resilience and self-care, and created a robust self-service, online communication and learning hub on racial and social justice.\n\u2022EMPLOYEES/HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Eversource recognizes that its employees are its most valuable asset. Eversource has developed strategic workplans as part of the annual business and workforce planning process to address immediate and long-range needs to ensure that Eversource acquires, develops and retains excellent talent. Virtual learning and development opportunities were provided to employees, including on-boarding sessions with specific focus on engaging new Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts employees. No employees, whether from the acquired company Columbia Gas or otherwise, were subject to lay-offs as a result of the pandemic. Interactive engagement and support tools were offered to promote remote worker effectiveness supporting the workforce with business, leadership and technical knowledge. Employee development programs were aligned to the strategic workforce plan to support succession within all levels of the organization. Programs like the Growth Opportunities for Leadership Development and the engineering associate cohort programs promoted educational and professional development opportunities for recent college graduates. Tuition assistance programs, paid internships, co-ops and other pipeline development programs continued to the greatest extent possible to ensure progress in future workforce technical skills and competencies. Through targeted training, development and educational activities, Eversource offered high performers numerous learning experiences to ensure their growth and development as future leaders. Thought provoking stretch assignments, high impact cross-functional team memberships, senior management interaction and exposure, targeted coaching and feedback, and diverse learning experiences that promote interdependent thinking, embrace alternative perspectives, while building teamwork and collaboration represent examples of key components of Eversource\u2019s key talent program. With a strong focus on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, discussions, programs and activities were offered to provide education and experiences to further emphasize messages of Racial and Social Justice. Additionally, Eversource leveraged educational partnerships in critical trade and technical areas and has developed proactive sourcing strategies to attract experienced workers in highly technical roles in areas like engineering, electric and gas operations, and energy efficiency. As part of this process, Eversource identified critical roles and developed succession plans to ensure Eversource has talent now and for the future. Eversource also provides employees with fair pay, comprehensive benefits, and a variety of field and classroom training opportunities throughout their careers to support their ongoing success on the job.\n\u2022AWARDS: Eversource continued to receive numerous local and national awards in 2020 recognizing Eversource as a leader and catalyst in the areas of Sustainability and ESG.\n\u2022Eversource was again ranked in the top 100 of America\u2019s Most Just Companies by FORBES/JUST Capital. The listing recognizes corporate social responsibility and commitment to local communities and celebrates public companies for their positive impact and leadership on priorities such as ethical leadership, environmental impact, customer treatment, fair pay and benefits, equal opportunity and shareholder return.\n\u2022For the second year in a row, Newsweek magazine ranked Eversource as the #1 energy company in their 2021 list of the Most Responsible Companies. This listing is based on an analysis of a company\u2019s corporate social responsibility, as well as a public survey.\n\u2022For the third consecutive year, Eversource was selected to be included in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, which recognizes companies who have shown their commitment to advancing women\u2019s equality in the workplace and transparency in gender reporting.\n\u2022Eversource was included in 3BL Media\u2019s ranking of the top 100 Best Corporate Citizens of 2020 for leading ESG transparency and performance among 1,000 of the largest U.S. public companies.\n\u2022Eversource was recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor as a HIRE Vets Medallion Award recipient for its commitment to recruiting, employing, and retaining veterans. We are proud to support veteran careers.\n\u2022The National Organization on Disability (NOD) honored Eversource as a 2020 Leading Disability Employer. Now in its sixth year, the NOD Leading Disability Employer Seal is a recognition of organizations that are leading the way in disability inclusion and tapping into the many benefits of hiring talent who are differently-abled, including high rates of productivity and dedication, and greater employee engagement across the workforce.\n\u2022Eversource was again selected as a \u201cmost honored\u201d company by Institutional Investor magazine in its survey of some 1,500 portfolio managers and investment analysts. Eversource was designated as the #2 utility company in each of the eight company categories, including those related to ESG.\n\u2022Eversource was one of only four energy companies included in Barron\u2019s 2020 Most Sustainable Companies list. Barron\u2019s based their list on 230 performance indicators that address environmental, social and governance matters.\nAchievement of the 2020 performance goals, additional accomplishments and the Compensation Committee\u2019s assessment of Company and executive performance are more fully described in the section below titled \u201c2020 Annual Incentive Program Assessment.\u201d Specific decisions regarding executive compensation based upon the Committee\u2019s assessment of Company and executive performance and market data are also described below.\nPay for Performance Philosophy\nThe Compensation Committee links the compensation of the executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, to performance that will ultimately benefit customers, employees, and shareholders. Eversource\u2019s compensation program is intended to attract and retain the best executive talent in the industry, motivate executives to meet or exceed specific stretch financial and operational goals each year, and compensate executives in a manner that aligns compensation directly with performance. Eversource strives to provide executives with base salary, performance-based annual incentive compensation, and performance-based long-term incentive compensation opportunities that are competitive with market practices and that reward excellent performance.\nExecutive Compensation Governance\nWhat Eversource DOES:\n\u00fc Pay for Performance\n\u00fc Share ownership and holding guidelines\n\u00fc Balanced incentive metrics\n\u00fc Delivery of the majority of incentive compensation opportunity in long-term equity\n\u00fc Broad financial and personal misconduct clawback policy relating to incentive compensation\n\u00fc Double-trigger change in control vesting provisions\n\u00fc Shareholder engagement meetings throughout the year between management and Eversource shareholders that discuss compensation governance\n\u00fc For 2021, 75 percent of long-term incentive compensation will be tied to performance\n\u00fc 100 percent of long-term incentive compensation paid in equity\n\u00fc Independent compensation consultant\n\u00fc Annual Say-on-Pay vote\n\u00fc Payout limitations on incentive awards\n\u00fc Limited executive and Trustee trading window\nWhat Eversource DOESN\u2019T do:\n\u00fb Tax gross ups in any new or materially amended executive compensation agreements\n\u00fb Hedging, pledging or similar transactions by executives and Trustees\n\u00fb Liberal share recycling\n\u00fb Dividends on equity awards before vesting\n\u00fb Discounts or repricing of options or stock appreciation rights\n\u00fb Change in control agreements (since 2010)\n\u2022The executive share ownership and holding guidelines noted in this CD&A emphasize the importance of aligning management with shareholders. Under the share ownership guidelines, which require Eversource\u2019s Chief Executive Officer to hold shares equal to six times base salary, Eversource requires executives to hold 100 percent of the shares awarded under the Company\u2019s stock compensation program until the share ownership guidelines have been met.\n\u2022Eversource\u2019s Incentive Plan includes a clawback provision that requires executives and all other participants to reimburse the Company for incentive compensation received, not only if earnings are subsequently required to be restated as a result of noncompliance with accounting rules caused by fraud or misconduct, but also for a willful material violation of Eversource\u2019s Code of Business Conduct or significant breach of a material covenant in an employment agreement. The Plan also imposes limits on awards and on Trustee compensation and prohibits repricing of awards and liberal share recycling.\n\u2022Eversource prohibits gross ups in all new or materially amended executive compensation agreements.\n\u2022Eversource has a \u201cno hedging and no pledging\u201d policy that prohibits the purchase of financial instruments or otherwise entering into any transactions that are designed to have the effect of hedging or offsetting any decrease in the market value of its common shares.\n\u2022Eversource\u2019s employment agreements and incentive plan require a \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d change in control to accelerate compensation.\nNamed Executive Officers\nThe executive officers of CL&P listed in the Summary Compensation Table and whose compensation is discussed in this CD&A are referred to as the \u201cNamed Executive Officers\u201d under SEC regulations. For 2020, CL&P\u2019s Named Executive Officers were:\n\u2022James J. Judge, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Eversource Energy and Chairman of the Board of CL&P\n\u2022Philip J. Lembo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Eversource Energy and CL&P\n\u2022Werner J. Schweiger, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Eversource Energy and Chief Executive Officer of CL&P\n\u2022Joseph R. Nolan, Jr., Executive Vice President - Strategy, Customer and Corporate Relations of Eversource Energy and Eversource Service\n\u2022Gregory B. Butler, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Eversource Energy and CL&P\nOverview of Eversource\u2019s Compensation Program\nThe Role of the Compensation Committee. The Eversource Board of Trustees has delegated to the Compensation Committee overall responsibility for establishing the compensation program for those senior executive officers, whom we refer to in this CD&A as \u201cexecutives\u201d and whom are deemed to be \u201cofficers\u201d under the SEC\u2019s regulations that determine the persons whose compensation is subject to disclosure. In this role, the Committee sets compensation policy and compensation levels, reviews and approves performance goals and evaluates executive performance. Although this CD&A refers principally to compensation for the Named Executive Officers, the same compensation principles and practices apply to all executives. The compensation of Eversource\u2019s Chief Executive Officer is subject to the further review and approval of all of the independent Eversource Trustees.\nElements of Compensation. Total direct compensation consists of three elements: base salary, annual cash incentive awards, and long-term equity-based incentive awards. Indirect compensation is provided through certain retirement, perquisite, severance, and health and welfare benefit programs.\nEversource\u2019s Compensation Objectives. The objectives of Eversource\u2019s compensation program are to attract and retain superior executive talent, motivate executives to achieve annual and long-term performance goals set each year, and provide total compensation opportunities that are competitive with market practices. With respect to incentive compensation, the Committee believes it is important to balance short-term goals, such as producing earnings, with longer-term goals, such as long-term value creation for shareholders, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and being a leader in clean energy and sustainability. The Committee also places great emphasis on operating performance, customer service, safety, sustainability and workforce diversity. Eversource\u2019s compensation program utilizes performance-based incentive compensation to reward individual and corporate performance and to align the interests of executives with Eversource Energy\u2019s customers, employees, and shareholders. The Committee continually increases expectations to motivate executives and employees to achieve continuous improvement in carrying out their responsibilities to customers to deliver energy and water reliably, safely, mindful of the environment and employee well-being, and at a reasonable cost, while providing an above-average total return to Eversource shareholders.\nSetting Compensation Levels. To ensure that Eversource achieves its goal of providing market-based total direct compensation levels to attract and retain top quality management, the Committee provides executives with target compensation opportunities approximately equal to median compensation levels for executive officers of companies in the utility industry comparable to Eversource in size. To achieve that goal, the Committee and its independent compensation consultant work together to determine the market values of executive direct and indirect compensation elements by using competitive market compensation data.\nThe Committee reviews competitive compensation data obtained from utility and general industry surveys and a specific group of peer utility companies. Incumbent compensation levels may be set below the market median for those executives who are new to their roles, while long-tenured, high performing executives may be compensated above median. The review by Pay Governance performed in December 2020 indicated that Eversource\u2019s aggregate executive compensation levels continue to be aligned with median market rates.\nRole of the Compensation Consultant. The Committee has retained Pay Governance as its independent compensation consultant. Pay Governance reports directly to the Committee and does not provide any other services to Eversource. With the consent of the Committee, Pay Governance works cooperatively with Eversource\u2019s management to develop analyses and proposals for presentation to the Committee. The Committee generally relies on Pay Governance for peer group market data and information as to market practices and trends to assess the competitiveness of the compensation Eversource pays to executives and to review the Committee\u2019s proposed compensation decisions.\nPay Governance Independence. In February 2021, the Committee assessed the independence of Pay Governance pursuant to SEC and NYSE rules, and concluded that it is independent and that no conflict of interest exists that would prevent Pay Governance from independently advising the Committee. In making this assessment, the Committee considered the independence factors enumerated in Rule 10C-1(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the written representations of Pay Governance that Pay Governance does not provide any other services to Eversource, the level of fees received from Eversource as a percentage of Pay Governance\u2019s total revenues, the policies and procedures employed by Pay Governance to prevent conflicts of interest, and whether the individual Pay Governance advisers with whom the Committee consulted own any Eversource Energy common shares or have any business or personal relationships with members of the Committee or the Eversource executives.\nRole of Management. The role of Eversource\u2019s management, and specifically the roles of Eversource\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Information Technology, are to provide current compensation information to the compensation consultant and analyses and recommendations on executive compensation to the Committee based on the market value of the position, individual performance, experience and internal pay equity. Eversource\u2019s Chief Executive Officer also provides recommendations on the compensation for the other Eversource Named Executive Officers. None of the executives makes recommendations that affect their individual compensation.\nMARKET ANALYSIS\nThe Compensation Committee seeks to provide executives with target compensation opportunities using a range that is approximately equal to the median compensation levels for executive officers of utility companies comparable to Eversource. Set forth below is a description of the sources of the compensation data used by the Committee when reviewing 2020 compensation:\n\u2022Competitive Compensation Survey Data. The Committee reviews compensation information obtained from surveys of diverse groups of utility and general industry companies that represent Eversource\u2019s market for executive officer talent. Utility industry data serve as the primary reference point for benchmarking officer compensation and are based on a defined peer set, as discussed below, while general industry data are derived from compensation consultant surveys and serve as a secondary reference point. General industry data are used for staff positions and are size adjusted to ensure a close correlation between the market data and the Company\u2019s scope of operations.\nThe Committee references this information, which it obtains from Pay Governance, to evaluate and determine base salaries and incentive opportunities.\n\u2022Peer Group Data. In support of executive pay decisions, the Committee consulted with Pay Governance, which provided the Committee with a competitive assessment analysis of Eversource\u2019s executive compensation levels as compared to the 18 peer group companies listed in the table below. This peer group, which the Committee reviews annually, was chosen because these companies are similar to Eversource Energy in terms of size, business model and long-term strategies.\nThe Committee adjusts the target percentages of annual and long-term incentives based on the survey data and recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer, after discussion with the compensation consultant, to ensure that they are approximately equal to competitive median levels.\nThe Committee periodically reviews the general market for supplemental benefits and perquisites using utility and general industry survey data, including data obtained from companies in the peer group.\nMIX OF COMPENSATION ELEMENTS\nEversource targets the mix of compensation for its Chief Executive Officer and its other Named Executive Officers so that the percentages of each compensation element are approximately equal to the competitive median market mix. The mix is heavily weighted toward incentive compensation, and incentive compensation is heavily weighted toward long-term compensation. Since the most senior positions have the greatest responsibility for implementing Eversource\u2019s long-term business plans and strategies, a greater proportion of total compensation is based on performance with a long-term focus.\nThe Committee determines the compensation for each executive based on the relative authority, duties and responsibilities of the executive. Eversource\u2019s Chief Executive Officer\u2019s responsibilities for the strategic direction and daily operations and management of Eversource are greater than the duties and responsibilities of the other executives. As a result, Eversource\u2019s Chief Executive Officer\u2019s compensation is higher than the compensation of those other executives. Assisted by the compensation consultant, the Committee regularly reviews market compensation data for executive officer positions similar to those held by Eversource\u2019s executives, including its Chief Executive Officer.\nThe following table sets forth the contribution to 2020 Total Direct Compensation (TDC) of each element of compensation at target, reflected as a percentage of TDC, for the Named Executive Officers. The percentages shown in this table are at target and therefore do not correspond to the amounts appearing in the Summary Compensation Table.\n(1) The annual incentive compensation element and performance shares under the long-term incentive compensation element are performance-based. Beginning in 2021, the Compensation Committee increased the percentage of Performance Shares in the long-term incentive program from 50 percent to 75 percent for all of the Named Executive Officers. As a result, the percentage of Performance Shares in 2021 will increase from 34 percent of TDC to 51 percent for Mr. Judge, from 27.5 percent of TDC to 41 percent for Messrs. Lembo, Schweiger and Nolan, and from 26 percent of TDC to 39 percent for Mr. Butler.\n(2) Restricted Share Units (RSUs) vest over three years contingent upon continued employment.\nRISK ANALYSIS OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM\nThe overall compensation program includes a mix of compensation elements ranging from a fixed base salary that is not at risk to annual and long-term incentive compensation programs intended to motivate executives and other eligible employees to achieve individual and corporate performance goals that reflect an appropriate level of risk. The fundamental objective of the compensation program is to foster the continued growth and success of Eversource\u2019s business. The design and implementation of the overall compensation program provide the Committee with opportunities throughout the year to assess risks within the compensation program that may have a material effect on Eversource and its shareholders.\nThe Compensation Committee assesses the risks associated with the executive compensation program on an ongoing basis by reviewing the various elements of incentive compensation. The annual incentive program is designed to ensure an appropriate balance between individual and corporate goals, which were deemed appropriate and supportive of Eversource\u2019s annual business plan. Similarly, the long-term incentive program is designed to ensure that the performance metrics are properly weighted and supportive of Eversource\u2019s strategy. The Committee reviewed the overall compensation program in the context of risks identified in the annual operating plan. The annual and long-term incentive programs were designed to include mechanisms to mitigate risk. These mechanisms include realistic goal setting and discretion with respect to actual payments, in addition to:\n\u2022A mix of annual and long-term performance awards to provide an appropriate balance of short- and long-term risk and reward horizon;\n\u2022A variety of performance metrics, including financial, operational, customer service, ESG, diversity and safety goals and other strategic initiatives for annual performance awards to avoid excessive focus on a single measure of performance;\n\u2022Metrics in Eversource\u2019s long-term incentive compensation program that use earnings per share growth and relative total shareholder return, which are both robust measures of shareholder value and which reduce the risk that employees might be encouraged to pursue other objectives that increase risk or reduce financial performance;\n\u2022The provisions of Eversource\u2019s annual and long-term incentive programs, which cap awards at 200 percent of target;\n\u2022Eversource\u2019s expansive clawback provisions on incentive compensation, including clawback for material violations of the Eversource Code of Business Conduct; and\n\u2022Stock ownership requirements for all executives, including Eversource\u2019s NEOs, and prohibitions on hedging, pledging and other derivative transactions related to Eversource common shares.\nBased on these factors, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Trustees believe the overall compensation program risks are mitigated to reduce overall compensation risk.\nResults of Eversource's 2020 Say-on-Pay Vote. Eversource provides its shareholders with the required opportunity to cast the annual advisory vote on executive compensation (a Say-on-Pay proposal). At Eversource\u2019s Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 6, 2020, 89 percent of the votes cast on the Say-on-Pay proposal were voted to approve the 2019 compensation of the Named Executive Officers, as described in Eversource\u2019s 2020 proxy statement. Say-on-Pay results of the Company, along with utility and general industry peers, are reviewed by the Committee annually to help assess whether Eversource shareholders continue to deem its executives\u2019 compensation to be appropriate. The Committee has and will continue to consider the outcome of Eversource\u2019s s Say-on-Pay votes when making future compensation decisions for the Named Executive Officers.\nELEMENTS OF 2020 COMPENSATION\nBase Salary\nBase salary is designed to attract and retain key executives by providing an element of total compensation at levels competitive with those of other executives employed by companies of similar size and complexity in the utility and general industries. In establishing base salary, the Compensation Committee relies on compensation data obtained from independent third-party surveys of companies and from an industry peer group to ensure that the compensation opportunities Eversource offers are capable of attracting and retaining executives with the experience and talent required to achieve its strategic objectives. Adjustments to base salaries are generally made on an annual basis except in instances of promotions.\nWhen setting or adjusting base salaries, the Committee considers annual executive performance appraisals; market pay movement across industries (determined through market analysis); targeted market pay positioning for each executive; individual experience; strategic importance of a position; recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer; and internal pay equity.\nDue to the hardships experienced by Eversource\u2019s customers and communities as a result of COVID-19 and the extended outages that took place in 2020 in Connecticut following Storm Isaias, and in spite of excellent performance by the executives in 2020, the Compensation Committee determined that it would freeze base salaries for Eversource\u2019s senior executive officers, including its Named Executive Officers, at 2020 levels, rather than provide market based base salary increases.\nIncentive Compensation\nAnnual incentive and long-term incentive compensation are provided under Eversource\u2019s Incentive Plan, which was approved by its shareholders in 2018. The annual incentive program provides cash compensation intended to reward performance under Eversource\u2019s annual operating plan. The long-term stock-based incentive program is designed to reward demonstrated performance and leadership, motivate future performance, align the interests of the executives with those of shareholders, and retain executives during the term of grants. The annual and long-term programs are designed to strike a balance between Eversource\u2019s short- and long-term objectives so that the programs work in tandem.\nIn addition to the specific performance goals, the Committee assesses other factors, as well as the executives\u2019 roles and individual performance and then makes annual incentive program awards at the levels and amounts disclosed in this CD&A.\n2020 ANNUAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM ASSESSMENT\nIn early February of 2020, the Committee established the terms of the 2020 Annual Incentive Program. As part of the overall program, and after consulting with Pay Governance, the Committee set target award levels for each of Eversource\u2019s Named Executive Officers that ranged from 70 percent to 125 percent of base salary.\nAt the February 2020 meeting, the Committee determined that for 2020 it would continue to base 70 percent of the annual incentive performance goals on Eversource\u2019s overall financial performance and 30 percent of the annual performance goals on Eversource\u2019s overall operational performance. The Committee also determined the specific goals that would be used to assess performance, with potential ratings on each goal ranging from zero percent to 200 percent of target. The Committee assigned weightings to each of the goals. For the financial component, the following goals were used: earnings per share, weighted at 60 percent, dividend growth, weighted at 10 percent, and advancement of strategic growth initiatives and regulatory outcomes, weighted at 30 percent. For the operational component, the Committee used the following goals: combined service reliability and restoration goals, weighted at 50 percent, and combined safety ratings, gas service response, diversity promotions and hires of leadership employee positions, and sustainability, customer and clean energy initiatives, weighted at 50 percent.\nIn establishing the individual annual performance goals, the Committee sets stretch goals for both the Financial and Operational components. Many of the goals use performance ranges, as opposed to threshold or target metrics, whereby the lower end of the performance range does not represent average or less compared to industry peers, or other similar performance benchmarks, but requires performance that exceeds industry standards, peer performance and other benchmarks in order to be met, while achievement at the higher end of the range represents top-of-industry performance. Achieving performance of these stretch goals within the particular range will therefore justify an assessment beyond target.\n2020 Performance Goals\nAt the December 2020 meeting of the Committee, Eversource\u2019s management provided an initial review of its 2020 performance, followed in February 2021 by a full assessment of the performance goals, the additional accomplishments noted below under the caption \u201cAdditional Factors\u201d and the overall performance of Eversource and its executives. In addition to these meetings, the Committee and the Eversource Board were provided updates during 2020 on corporate performance. At the February 8, 2021 meeting, the Committee determined, based on its assessment of the financial and operational performance goals, to set the level of achievement of combined financial and operational performance goals results at 161 percent, reflecting the strong performance of Eversource and its executive team in executing Eversource\u2019s Operating Plan and adapting quickly to the COVID-19 pandemic to keep its customers and employees safe and to maintain effective operations. In arriving at this determination, the Committee determined that the weighted financial performance goals result was 116 percent and the weighted operational performance goals result was 45 percent. In making the awards, the Committee made its determinations on the results without factoring the pandemic into its deliberations and did not take into account the additional complexities involved in executing the Operating Plan and accomplishing the goals. Eversource\u2019s Chief Executive Officer recommended to the Committee awards for its executives (other than himself) based on his assessment of each of the executive\u2019s individual performance towards achievement of the performance goals and the additional accomplishments of Eversource, together with each of the executive\u2019s contributions to the overall performance of Eversource. The actual awards determined by the Committee were also based on the same criteria.\nFinancial Performance Goals Assessment\n\u2022FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE: Eversource\u2019s non-GAAP earnings per share in 2020, which excludes the Columbia Gas asset acquisition transactional costs, increased by 5.5 percent when compared to non-GAAP earnings per share in 2019, and met the established goal of $3.64. Eversource was able to achieve this goal through effective management of the 2020 Operating Plan on a day-by-day basis and by overcoming several challenges to plan achievement, including higher than plan O&M expenses caused primarily by the significant number and severity of storm events and the financial and operational impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn determining that it was appropriate to assess the earnings per share goal based on recurring, non-GAAP earnings, the Committee considered the fact that the one-time transactional costs of the complex Columbia Gas asset acquisition, which were the only costs excluded in the calculation of non-GAAP earnings, were a significant strategic opportunity for Eversource, completed in an accelerated timeframe with constructive regulatory outcomes. The Committee determined the earnings per share goal to have attained a 150 percent performance result.\n\u2022DIVIDEND GROWTH: Eversource increased its dividend to $2.27 per share, a 6.1 percent increase from the prior year, significantly above the utility industry\u2019s median dividend growth of 4.5 percent for the EEI Utility Index. The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 160 percent performance result.\n\u2022STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND REGULATORY OUTCOMES: Although Eversource faced challenges caused by the restrictions resulting from the pandemic, it successfully completed the acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gas in seven months; the acquisition was immediately accretive to earnings and is expected to be increasingly so in future years. As part of the acquisition regulatory approval process, Eversource successfully reached a constructive 8-year rate settlement agreement for the new entity, Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts. Eversource achieved constructive outcomes in the PSNH and NSTAR Gas subsidiary rate reviews, completed the sale by the Aquarion Water Company of assets located in Hingham, Massachusetts in satisfaction of a predecessor company agreement, and successfully executed several storm cost recovery proceedings in the three states Eversource serves. The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 200 percent performance result.\nOperational Performance Goals Assessment\n\u2022RELIABILITY PERFORMANCE: Electric System Reliability, measured by months between interruptions, was top decile in the industry in 2020; customer power interruptions were on average 19.2 months apart. The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 175 percent performance result.\n\u2022RESTORATION PERFORMANCE: The average system outage duration was 64.0 minutes, which was in the top decile of the industry for the fastest restoration time. The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 175 percent performance result.\n\u2022SAFETY: Eversource\u2019s safety performance was 0.7, measured by days away, restricted or transferred (DART) per 100 workers, which continued to outperform the industry in 2020. In addition to the safety performance as measured by DART, the policies and procedures Eversource established at the onset of the pandemic were and continue to be a significant and successful part of our overall safety performance. The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 150 percent performance result.\n\u2022GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE: On-time response to gas customer emergency calls was 99.6 percent, meeting industry standards. The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 100 percent performance result.\n\u2022DIVERSITY: Eversource continued to support many programs and agencies that address racial and ethnic disparities in its customers\u2019 communities and beyond. Eversource also continues to develop a workforce that fully reflects the diversity of the people and communities Eversource serves. Eversource\u2019s hiring practices emphasize diversity, and encourage employees to embrace different people, perspectives and experiences in its workplace and within its communities - regardless of their race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, gender identity, age, disability, marital status, sexual orientation, active military or veteran status. Eversource continued its successful drive to increase workforce diversity; in 2020, 47.6 percent of new hires and promotions into leadership roles were women or people of color. In addition, in response to the social unrest last year, Eversource conducted listening sessions with its business resource groups and established a racial equity task force. Eversource also started a highly attended employee town hall series focused on taking action to advance racial equality and to disrupt racism. In addition, Eversource launched a webinar series on employee resilience and self-care, and created a robust self-service, online communication and learning hub on racial and social justice. The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 200 percent performance result.\n\u2022SUSTAINABILITY: Eversource\u2019s goal in 2020 was to be in the 75th percentile performance of a peer group of comparably sized U.S. utilities whose ESG performance is assessed by two leading sustainability rating firms. Eversource\u2019s performance was determined to be at the 85th percentile of the peer group. The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 150 percent performance result.\n\u2022CUSTOMERS: Eversource continued to add to its customer messaging programs, including those relating to COVID-19, realized all-time highs in both digital messaging and estimated time to restore communications, led the industry in the early implementation of customer service termination moratoria, and implemented extended customer forgiveness and extended payment programs. However, Eversource acknowledged that as a result of Tropical Storm Isaias, which caused extensive, catastrophic damage to CL&P\u2019s distribution system and many prolonged outages, its customers\u2019 and government leaders\u2019 perception was that its performance fell short of their expectations. In recognition of this sentiment, the Committee did not attribute any performance percentage value to the customer goals in its overall assessment to the goals, such that the goal was assessed at zero percent.\n\u2022CLEAN ENERGY LEADERSHIP: Regarding Eversource\u2019s offshore wind projects, Eversource continued to advance the New London State Pier project in Connecticut, giving the Eversource/\u00d8rsted partnership access to the leading offshore wind port in the Northeast; reached a comprehensive settlement for the joint Eversource/\u00d8rsted South Fork project with the Town of East Hampton, New York and the Board of Trustees for South Fork relating to the installation of the onshore transmission facilities to be constructed in those two communities; and submitted Construction and Operating Plans with the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management for the joint Eversource/\u00d8rsted Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind projects. In June of 2020, Eversource began construction of a first in the nation community battery storage project at the Provincetown, Massachusetts town transfer station. Eversource\u2019s electric vehicle charging infrastructure program met its 2020 targets; Eversource led efforts to expand Massachusetts\u2019 utility scale solar program, and Eversource\u2019s energy efficiency programs, while slowed by the COVID-19 pandemic, continued to perform at national leading level as noted by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy. The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 125 percent performance result.\n2020 Annual Incentive Program Performance Assessments\nAdditional Factors\nThe following important financial, strategic, operational, environmental and customer-focused results were also considered by the Committee in assessing overall financial and operational performance, but were not given specific weightings or assigned a specific performance assessment score:\n\u2022Eversource was again ranked in the top 100 of America\u2019s Most Just companies by FORBES/JUST Capital. The listing recognizes corporate social responsibility and commitment to the local communities and celebrates public companies for their positive impact and leadership on priorities such as ethical leadership, environmental impact, customer treatment, fair pay and benefits, equal opportunity and shareholder return.\n\u2022Again this year, Newsweek magazine ranked Eversource as the #1 energy company in their 2021 list of the Most Responsible Companies. This listing is based on an analysis of a company\u2019s corporate social responsibility, as well as a public survey.\n\u2022For the third consecutive year, Eversource was selected to be included in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, which recognizes companies who have shown their commitment to advancing women\u2019s equality in the workplace and transparency in gender reporting.\n\u2022Eversource was included in 3BL Media\u2019s ranking of the top 100 Best Corporate Citizens of 2020 for leading ESG transparency and performance among 1,000 of the largest U.S. public companies.\n\u2022Eversource was recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor as a HIRE Vets Medallion Award recipient for its commitment to recruiting, employing, and retaining veterans. We are proud to support veteran careers.\n\u2022The National Organization on Disability (NOD) honored Eversource as a 2020 Leading Disability Employer. Now in its sixth year, the NOD Leading Disability Employer Seal is a recognition of organizations that are leading the way in disability inclusion and tapping into the many benefits of hiring talent who are differently-abled, including high rates of productivity and dedication, and greater employee engagement across the workforce.\n\u2022Eversource was one of only four energy companies included in Barron\u2019s 2020 Most Sustainable Companies list. Barron\u2019s bases this list on 230 performance indicators that address environmental, social and governance matters.\n\u2022Eversource was again selected as a \u201cmost honored\u201d company by Institutional Investor magazine in its survey of some 1,500 portfolio managers and investment analysts. Eversource was designated as the #2 utility company in each of the eight company categories, including those related to ESG.\n\u2022Eversource\u2019s 2020 charitable giving totaled $8.1 million, including major event lead sponsorships for the Eversource Walk for Children\u2019s Hospital of Boston, Eversource Walk and 5K Run for Easterseals New Hampshire, Mass General Cancer Center/Eversource Every Day Amazing Race, Eversource Hartford Marathon, Travelers Championship, and Special Olympics in Connecticut and New Hampshire. Most of these events were held \u201cvirtually\u201d, and many Eversource employees assisted in carrying out of these events to help ensure their success.\nIndividual Executives' Performance Factors Considered by the Committee\nIt is the Committee\u2019s philosophy to provide incentives for Eversource executives to work together as a highly effective, integrated team to achieve or exceed the financial, operational, safety, customer, sustainability, strategic and diversity goals and objectives. The Committee also reviews and assesses individual executive performance. The Committee based the annual incentive payments on team performance and the Committee\u2019s assessment of each of Eversource\u2019s executive\u2019s individual performance in supporting the performance goals, additional achievements, and overall results of Eversource. With respect to Eversource\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, the Committee and Eversource\u2019s independent Trustees assessed his performance. Based on the recommendations of Eversource\u2019s Chief Executive Officer as to executives other than himself, the Committee assessed the performance of the Named Executive Officers and Eversource to be excellent in totality and approved annual incentive program payments for its Named Executive Officers at levels that ranged from 149 percent to 167 percent of target. These payments reflected the individual and team contributions of each of the Named Executive Officers in achieving the goals and the additional accomplishments and the overall performance of the Company.\nIn determining Mr. Judge\u2019s annual incentive payment of $2,750,000, which was 161 percent of target and which reflects his and Eversource\u2019s excellent 2020 performance, the Eversource Committee and Board considered the totality of Eversource\u2019s success in accomplishing the goals set by the Committee. The Committee also reviewed the additional accomplishments of Eversource and the superior leadership of Mr. Judge, who again led a very high- performing company to another successful year, including Mr. Judge\u2019s continued emphasis on the importance of both protecting the planet and pushing for racial and social justice while ensuring a focus on the safety of Eversource employees and the public from the very beginning of the pandemic, which he continues to do to this day.\nLong-Term Incentive Program\nGeneral Discussion and Changes for 2021\nEversource\u2019s long-term incentive program is intended to focus on its longer-term strategic goals and to help retain its executives. A new three-year program commences every year. For the three programs described below, each of Eversource\u2019s executive\u2019s target long-term incentive opportunity consisted of 50 percent Performance Shares and 50 percent RSUs. However, for the 2021 - 2023 Program, Eversource has increased the percentage of total long term incentive opportunity that is provided in performance shares to a mix of 75 percent Performance Shares and 25 percent RSUs in response to shareholder comments that it received at shareholder engagement sessions that suggested that the percentage of performance shares should be increased, and to further align its compensation programs with the Committee\u2019s pay for performance philosophy. Performance Shares are designed to reward long-term achievements as measured against pre-established performance measures. RSUs are designed to provide executives with an incentive to increase the value of the Eversource\u2019s common shares in alignment with shareholder interests, while also serving as a retention component for executive talent. Eversource believes these compensation elements create a focus on continued Company and share price growth to further align the interests of Eversource executives with the interests of Eversource shareholders.\nPerformance Share Grants\nGeneral\nPerformance Shares are designed to reward future financial performance, measured by long-term earnings growth and shareholder returns over a three-year performance period, therefore aligning executive compensation with performance. Performance Shares are granted as a target number of Eversource Energy common shares. The number of Performance Shares is determined by dividing the target grant value in dollars by the average daily closing prices of Eversource common shares on the New York Stock Exchange for the ten business days preceding the grant date and rounding to the nearest whole share. Until the end of the performance period, the value of dividends that would have been paid with respect to the Performance Shares had the Performance Shares been actual common shares will be deemed to be invested in additional Performance Shares, which remain at risk and do not vest until actual performance for the period is determined.\nPerformance Shares under the 2020 - 2022 and 2019 - 2021 Programs\nFor the 2020 - 2022 Program, the Committee determined it would measure performance using: (i) average diluted earnings per share growth (EPSG); and (ii) relative total shareholder return (TSR) measured against the performance of companies that comprise the EEI Index. As in previous years, the Committee selected EPSG and TSR as performance measures because the Committee continues to believe that they are generally recognized as the best indicators of overall corporate performance. The Committee considers it a best practice to use a combination of relative and absolute metrics, with absolute EPS growth serving as a key input to shareholder value and relative TSR serving as the output.\nThe Committee also determined that for the 2020-2022 Program it would increase the degree of EPSG performance required to achieve a target (100 percent) award from that required under previous years\u2019 Programs, and modified the Program by adding additional levels for which no award of shares would be made.\nThe number of Performance Shares awarded at the end of the three-year period ranges from zero percent to 200 percent of target, depending on EPSG and relative TSR performance as set forth in the performance matrix below. Performance Share grants are based on a percentage of annualized base salary at the time of the grant and are measured in dollars. The target number of shares under the 2020-2022 Program for the Named Executive Officers ranged from 90 percent to 240 percent of base salary. Vesting at 100 percent of target occurs at various combinations of EPSG and TSR performance. In addition, the value of any performance shares that actually vest may increase or decrease over the vesting period based on Eversource\u2019s share price performance. The number of performance shares granted at target were approved as set forth in the table below. The Committee and the independent members of the Eversource Board determined the Performance Share grants for its Chief Executive Officer. Based on input from Eversource\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, the Committee determined the Performance Share grants for each of its other executive officers, including the other Named Executive Officers.\nFor the 2019 - 2021 Program, the Committee used the same performance measures of EPSG and TSR and used the same criteria used in the 2018 - 2020 Program.\nThe performance matrices set forth below describe how the Performance Share payout will be determined under the 2020 - 2022 Long-Term Incentive Programs and how the Performance Share payout was determined under the 2018 - 2020 Program and will be determined under the 2019 - 2021 Program. Three-year average EPSG is cross-referenced with the actual three-year TSR percentile to determine actual performance share payout as a percentage of target,\nPerformance Shares are designed to reward future financial performance, measured by long-term earnings growth and shareholder returns over a three-year performance period, therefore aligning management compensation with performance. Performance Shares are granted as a target number of Eversource common shares. The number of Performance Shares is determined by dividing the target grant value in dollars by the average daily closing prices of Eversource common shares on the New York Stock Exchange for the ten business days preceding the grant date and rounding to the nearest whole share. Until the end of the performance period, the value of dividends that would have been paid with respect to the Performance Shares had the Performance Shares been actual common shares will be deemed to be invested in additional Performance Shares, which remain at risk and do not vest until actual performance for the period is determined.\nResults of the 2018 - 2020 Performance Share Program\nThe 2018 - 2020 Program was completed on December 31, 2020. The actual performance level achieved under the Program was a three-year average adjusted EPS growth of 5.4 percent and a three-year total shareholder return at the 92nd percentile, which, when interpolated in accordance with the criteria established by the Committee, resulted in vesting performance share units at 156 percent of target. 2019 and 2020 non-GAAP earnings per share, which excluded the Northern Pass Transmission Project impairment charge in 2019, as disclosed in Eversource\u2019s 2020 proxy statement CD&A, and the Columbia Gas acquisition transaction costs charge in 2020, were the basis for performance level assessment determined by the Committee at its February 2020 and 2021 meetings. Please see \u201c2020 Annual Incentive Program Assessment - FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE,\u201d above. At its February 8, 2021 meeting, the Committee confirmed that the actual results achieved were calculated in accordance with established performance criteria. The number of Performance Shares awarded to Eversource\u2019s Named Executive Officers were approved as set forth in the table below.\nRestricted Share Units (RSUs)\nGeneral\nEach RSU granted under the long-term incentive program entitles the holder to receive one common share at the time of vesting. All RSUs granted under the long-term incentive program vest in equal annual installments over three years. RSU holders are eligible to receive reinvested dividend units on outstanding RSUs held by them to the same extent that dividends are declared and paid on Eversource common shares. Reinvested dividend equivalents are accounted for as additional RSUs that accrue and are distributed with the common shares issued upon vesting of the underlying RSUs. Common shares, including any additional common shares in respect of reinvested dividend equivalents, are not issued for any RSUs that do not vest.\nThe Committee determined RSU grants for each Eversource executive officer participating in the long-term incentive program. RSU grants are based on a percentage of annualized base salary at the time of the grant. In 2020, the percentage used for each Eversource Named Executive Officer was based on their position in Eversource and ranged from 90 percent to 240 percent of base salary. The Committee reserves the right to increase or decrease the RSU grant from target for each executive officer under special circumstances. The Committee and all other independent members of the Eversource Board determined the RSU grants for its Chief Executive Officer. Based on input from Eversource\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, the Committee determined the RSU grants for each of the other executive officers, including Eversource\u2019s Named Executive Officers.\nAll RSUs are granted on the date of the Committee meeting at which they are approved. RSU grants are subsequently converted from a percent of salary into common share equivalents by dividing the value of each grant by the average closing price for Eversource common shares over the ten trading days prior to the date of the grant. RSU grants at 100 percent of target were approved as set forth in the table below.\nClawbacks\nIf Eversource\u2019s earnings were to be restated as a result of noncompliance with accounting rules caused by fraud or misconduct, or if a plan participant engages in a willful material violation of the Eversource Code of Business Conduct or material corporate policy, or the breach of a material covenant in an employment agreement, as determined by the Eversource Board of Trustees, the participant will be required by Eversource\u2019s 2018 Incentive Plan to reimburse Eversource for incentive compensation awards received by them for that year.\nNo Hedging and No Pledging Policy\nEversource has a long-standing policy prohibiting the purchase of any financial instruments or otherwise entering into transactions designed to have the effect of hedging or offsetting any decrease in the value of its common shares or other equity securities of Eversource or its subsidiaries by its Trustees and executives, including exchange-traded options to purchase or sell securities of Eversource (so-called \u201cputs\u201d and \u201ccalls\u201d) or\nfinancial instruments that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of securities of Eversource (including, but not limited to, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds). This policy also prohibits short sales, the holding of any Eversource common shares in a margin account, borrowing shares, selling future securities that establish a position that increases in value as the value of the Eversource\u2019s stock decreases, or pledging Eversource\u2019s common shares. The policy applies to Trustees and executives but not to non-executives and does not apply to broad-based index funds or similar transactions.\nShare Ownership Guidelines and Retention Requirements\nThe Committee has approved share ownership guidelines to further emphasize the importance of share ownership by Eversource officers. As indicated in the table below, the guidelines call for Eversource\u2019s Chief Executive Officer to own common shares equal to six times base salary, executive vice presidents to own a number of common shares equal to three times base salary, senior vice presidents to own common shares equal to two times base salary, and all other officers to own a number of common shares equal to one to one and one half times base salary. Officers and Eversource Trustees may only transact in Eversource Energy common shares during approved trading windows and are subject to continuing compliance with these share ownership guidelines.\nEversource requires that its officers attain these ownership levels within five years after promotion. All of Eversource\u2019s officers, including Eversource\u2019s Named Executive Officers, have either satisfied these share ownership guidelines or are expected to satisfy them within the applicable timeframe. Common shares, whether held of record, in street name, or in individual 401(k) accounts, and RSUs satisfy the ownership requirements. Unvested performance shares do not count toward satisfying the ownership guidelines. In addition to these share ownership guidelines noted above, all Eversource officers must hold the net shares awarded under Eversource\u2019s incentive compensation plan until the share ownership guidelines have been met.\nOther Benefits\nRetirement Benefits\nEversource provides a qualified defined benefit pension program for certain officers, which is a final average pay program subject to tax code limits. Because of such limits, Eversource also maintains a supplemental non-qualified pension program. Benefits are based on base salary and certain incentive payments, which is consistent with the goal of providing a retirement benefit that replaces a percentage of pre-retirement income. The supplemental program compensates for benefits barred by tax code limits, and generally provides (together with the qualified pension program) benefits equal to approximately 60 percent of pre-retirement compensation (subject to certain reductions) for Messrs. Judge, Lembo, Schweiger and Nolan, and approximately 50 percent of such compensation for Mr. Butler. The supplemental program was discontinued in 2012 for newly elected officers.\nFor certain participants, the benefits payable under the Supplemental Non-Qualified Pension Program differ from those described above. The program benefit payable to Mr. Schweiger is fully vested and is further reduced by benefits he is entitled to receive under previous employers\u2019 retirement plans.\nAlso see the narrative accompanying the \u201cPension Benefits\u201d table and accompanying notes for more detail on the above program.\n401(k) Benefits\nEversource offers a qualified 401(k) program for all employees, including executives, subject to tax code limits. After applying these limits, the program provides a match of 50 percent of the first eight percent of eligible base salary, up to a maximum of $11,400 per year for Messrs. Judge, Lembo, Schweiger and Nolan. For Mr. Butler, Eversource provides a match of 100 percent of the first three percent of eligible base salary, up to a maximum of $8,550 per year.\nDeferred Compensation\nEversource offers a non-qualified deferred compensation program for its executives. In 2020, the program allowed deferral of up to 100 percent of base salary, annual incentives and long-term incentive awards. The program allows participants to select investment measures for deferrals based on an array of deemed investment options (including certain mutual funds and publicly traded securities).\nSee the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table and accompanying notes for additional details on the above program.\nPerquisites\nEversource provides executives with limited financial planning benefits, vehicle leasing and access to tickets to sporting events. The current level of perquisites does not factor into decisions on total compensation.\nContractual Agreements\nEversource maintains contractual agreements with all of its Named Executive Officers that provide for potential compensation in the event of certain terminations, including termination following a Change in Control. Eversource believes these agreements are necessary to attract and retain high quality executives and to ensure executive focus on Eversource business during the period leading up to a potential Change in Control. The agreements are \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d agreements that provide executives with compensation in the event of a Change in Control followed by termination of employment due to one or more of the events set forth in the agreements, while still providing an incentive to remain employed with the Company for the transition period that follows.\nUnder the agreements, certain compensation is generally payable if, during the applicable change in control period, the executive is involuntarily terminated (other than for cause) or terminates employment for \u201cgood reason.\u201d These agreements are described more fully in the Tables following this CD&A under \u201cPayments Upon Termination.\u201d The Company has not entered into a Change in Control or employment agreement with any executive since 2010.\nTax and Accounting Considerations\nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code precludes a public company from taking an income tax deduction in any one year for compensation in excess of $1 million payable to its named executive officers who are employed on the last day of the fiscal year, unless certain specific performance goals are satisfied. Until January 1, 2018, there was an exception to the $1 million limitation for performance-based compensation meeting certain requirements. This exception was repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and the limitation on deductibility generally was expanded to include all Named Executive Officers. As a result, compensation paid to Named Executive Officers in excess of $1 million per officer will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of and not modified after November 2, 2017.\nThe Committee believes that the availability of a tax deduction for forms of compensation should be one of many factors taken into consideration of providing market-based compensation to attract and retain highly qualified executives. The Committee believes it is in Eversource\u2019s best interests to retain discretion to make compensation awards, whether or not deductible.\nEversource has adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. In general, Eversource and the Committee do not consider accounting considerations in structuring compensation arrangements.\nEquity Grant Practices\nEquity awards noted in the compensation tables are made annually at the February meeting of the Compensation Committee (subject to further approval by all of the independent members of the Eversource Board of Trustees of its Chief Executive Officer\u2019s award) when the Committee also determines base salary, annual incentive opportunities, long-term incentive compensation grants, and annual and long-term performance plan awards. The date of this meeting is chosen at least a year in advance, and therefore awards are not coordinated with the release of material non-public information.\nSUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\nThe table below summarizes the total compensation paid or earned by CL&P's principal executive officer (Mr. Judge), principal financial officer (Mr. Lembo) and the three other most highly compensated executive officers in 2020, determined in accordance with the applicable SEC disclosure rules (collectively, the Named Executive Officers). As explained in the footnotes below, the amounts reflect the economic benefit to each Named Executive Officer of the compensation item paid or accrued on behalf of the Named Executive Officers for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 in accordance with such rules. All salaries, annual incentive amounts and long-term incentive amounts shown for each Named Executive Officer were paid for all services rendered to Eversource Energy and its subsidiaries, including CL&P, in all capacities.\n(1) Reflects the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted share units (RSUs) and performance shares granted in each fiscal year, calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.\nRSUs were granted to each Named Executive Officer in 2020 as long-term compensation, which vest in equal annual installments over three years. Each of the Named Executive Officers was also granted performance shares as long-term incentive compensation. These performance shares will vest based on the extent to which the performance conditions described in the CD&A are achieved as of December 31, 2022. The grant date fair values for the performance shares, assuming achievement of the highest level of both performance conditions, are as follows: Mr. Judge: $5,038,577; Mr. Lembo: $1,213,649; Mr. Schweiger: $1,297,979; Mr. Nolan: $1,070,429; and Mr. Butler: $924,116.\nHolders of RSUs and performance shares are eligible to receive dividend equivalent units on outstanding awards to the same extent that dividends are declared and paid on Eversource common shares. Dividend equivalent units are accounted for as additional common shares that accrue and are distributed simultaneously with those common shares that are issued upon vesting of the underlying RSUs and performance shares. No dividends are paid unless and until the underlying shares vest.\n(2) Includes payments to the Named Executive Officers under the 2020 Annual Incentive Program: Mr. Judge: $2,750,000; Mr. Lembo: $950,000; Mr. Schweiger: $950,000; Mr. Nolan: $850,000; and Mr. Butler: $700,000.\n(3) Includes the actuarial increase in the present value from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 of the Named Executive Officers\u2019 accumulated benefits under all of Eversource\u2019s defined benefit pension programs and agreements, determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those appearing in the footnotes to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Named Executive Officer may not be fully vested in such amounts. More information on this topic is set forth in the Pension Benefits table. There were no above-market earnings in deferred compensation value during 2020, as the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan provide for market-based investments, including Eversource common shares.\n(4) Includes matching contributions allocated by us to the accounts of Named Executive Officers under the 401k Plan as follows: $11,400 for each of Messrs. Judge, Lembo, Schweiger and Nolan, and $8,550 for Mr. Butler. For Mr. Judge, the value shown includes financial planning services valued at $5,000 and $12,434 representing the value in 2020 of a company-owned vehicle provided to Mr. Judge. For Mr. Lembo, the value shown includes financial planning services valued at $5,000 and $5,585 representing the value in 2020 of a company-owned vehicle provided to Mr. Lembo. None of the other Named Executive Officers received perquisites valued in the aggregate in excess of $10,000.\n(5) The amounts in the Adjusted SEC Total column reflect an adjustment to the total compensation reported in the column marked SEC Total. The Adjusted SEC Total subtracts the actuarial change in pension value disclosed in the column titled \u201cChange in Pension Value and Non-Qualified Deferred Earnings\u201d as further described in footnote 3 above in order to reflect compensation earned during the year by the executive without consideration of pension benefit impacts. The amounts in this column differ substantially from, and are not a substitute for, the amounts noted in the SEC Total.\nGRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS DURING 2020\nThe Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table below provides information on the range of potential payouts under all incentive plan awards during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. The table also discloses the underlying equity awards and the grant date for equity-based awards. Eversource has not granted any stock options since 2002.\n(1) Reflects the number of performance shares granted to each of the Named Executive Officers on February 5, 2020 under the 2020 - 2022 Long-Term Incentive Program. Performance shares were granted subject to a three-year Performance Period that ends on December 31, 2022. At the end of the Performance Period, Eversource common shares will be awarded based on actual performance results as a percentage of target, subject to reduction for applicable payroll withholding taxes. Holders of performance shares are eligible to receive dividend equivalent units on outstanding performance shares awarded to them to the same extent that dividends are declared and paid on our common shares. Dividend equivalent units are accounted for as additional common shares that accrue and are distributed simultaneously with the number of common shares underlying the performance shares that are actually awarded. No dividends are paid unless and until the underlying shares vest. The Annual Incentive Program did not include an equity component.\n(2) Reflects the number of RSUs granted to each of the Named Executive Officers on February 5, 2020 under the 2020 - 2022 Long-Term Incentive Program. RSUs vest in equal installments on February 5, 2021, 2022 and 2023. We will distribute common shares with respect to vested RSUs on a one-for-one basis following vesting, after reduction for applicable payroll withholding taxes. Holders of RSUs are eligible to receive dividend equivalent units on outstanding RSUs awarded to them to the same extent that dividends are declared and paid on our common shares. Dividend equivalent units are accounted for as additional common shares that accrue and are distributed simultaneously with those common shares actually distributed in respect of the underlying RSUs. No dividends are paid unless and until the underlying shares vest.\n(3) Reflects the grant date fair value, determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, of RSUs and performance shares granted to the Named Executive Officers on February 5, 2020 under the 2020 - 2022 Long-Term Incentive Program.\n(4) The threshold payment under the Annual Incentive Program is 50 percent of target. The actual payments in 2021 for performance in 2020 are set forth in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan column of the Summary Compensation Table.\n(5) Reflects the range of potential payouts, if any, pursuant to performance share awards under the 2020 - 2022 Long-Term Incentive Program, as described in the CD&A.\nOUTSTANDING EQUITY GRANTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2020\nThe following table sets forth RSU and performance share grants outstanding at the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 for each of the Named Executive Officers. There are no outstanding options.\n(1) Awards and market values of awards appearing in the table and the accompanying notes have been rounded to whole units.\n(2) A total of 83,765 unvested RSUs vested on February 5, 2021 (Mr. Judge: 46,351; Mr. Lembo: 10,400; Mr. Schweiger: 10,644; Mr. Nolan: 8,106; and Mr. Butler: 8,243). A total of 52,269 unvested RSUs will vest on February 7, 2022 (Mr. Judge: 28,560; Mr. Lembo: 6,514, Mr. Schweiger: 6,719; Mr. Nolan: 5,292 and Mr. Butler: 5,184). A total of 23,266 unvested RSUs will vest on February 6, 2023 (Mr. Judge: 12,281; Mr. Lembo: 2,959; Mr. Schweiger: 3,164; Mr. Nolan: 2,609 and Mr. Butler: 2,253).\n(3) The market value of RSUs is determined by multiplying the number of RSUs by $86.51, the closing price per common share on December 31, 2020, the last trading day of the year.\n(4) Reflects the target payout level for performance shares granted under the 2018 - 2020 Program, the 2019 - 2021 Program and the 2020 - 2022 Program.\nThe performance period for the 2018 - 2020 Program ended on December 31, 2020. Awards under that program are set forth in the CD&A under the \u201cResults of the 2018 - 2020 Performance Share Program.\u201d\nThe performance share awards for 2019 - 2021 Program and the 2020 - 2022 Program will be based on actual performance results as a percentage of target, subject to reduction for applicable payroll withholding taxes. As described more fully under \u201cPerformance Shares\u201d in the CD&A and footnote (1) to the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table, performance shares will vest following a three-year performance period based on the extent to which the two performance conditions are achieved. Under the 2019 - 2021 Program, a total of 87,012 performance shares (including accrued dividend equivalents) will vest based on the extent to which the two performance conditions described in the CD&A are achieved as of December 31, 2021. Assuming achievement of these conditions at a target level of performance, the amount of the awards would be as follows: Mr. Judge: 48,834; Mr. Lembo: 10,668; Mr. Schweiger: 10,668; Mr. Nolan: 8,049; and Mr. Butler: 8,793. Under the 2020 - 2022 Program, a total of 69,791 performance shares (including accrued dividend equivalents) will vest based on the extent to which the two performance conditions described in the CD&A are achieved as of December 31, 2022. Assuming achievement of these conditions at a target level of performance, the amount of the awards would be as follows: Mr. Judge: 36,842; Mr. Lembo: 8,874; Mr. Schweiger: 9,491; Mr. Nolan: 7,827; and Mr. Butler: 6,757. No dividends are paid unless and until the underlying shares vest.\n(5) The market value is determined by multiplying the number of performance shares in the adjacent column by $86.51, the closing price of Eversource Energy common shares on December 31, 2020, the last trading day of the year.\nOPTION EXERCISES AND STOCK VESTED IN 2020\nThe following table reports amounts realized on equity compensation during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. The Stock Awards columns report the vesting of RSU and performance share grants to the Named Executive Officers in 2020.\n(1) Includes RSUs and performance shares granted to the Named Executive Officers under the long-term incentive programs, including dividend reinvestment, as follows:\nIn all cases, the distribution of common shares are reduced by that number of shares valued in an amount sufficient to satisfy payroll tax withholding obligations.\n(2) Values realized on vesting of RSUs granted under the 2017 - 2019, 2018 - 2020 and 2019 - 2021 Programs were based on $93.66 per share, the closing price of Eversource Energy common shares on February 14, 2020. Values realized on vesting of performance shares granted under the 2017 - 2019 Program were based on $95.65 per share, the closing price of Eversource common shares on February 20, 2020.\nPENSION BENEFITS IN 2020\nThe Pension Benefits Table shows the estimated present value of accumulated retirement benefits payable to each Named Executive Officer upon retirement based on the assumptions described below. The table distinguishes between benefits available under the qualified pension plan program (QP), the pension equity plan program (PEP), the supplemental pension program (SERP), and the supplemental pension (Excess). See the narrative above in the CD&A under the captions \u201cOther Benefits - Retirement Benefits\u201d and \u201cContractual Agreements\u201d for more detail on benefits under these plans and our agreements.\nThe values shown in the Pension Benefits Table for Messrs. Judge, Lembo, Schweiger and Nolan were calculated as of December 31, 2020 based on benefit payments in the form of a lump sum. For Mr. Butler, we assumed a payment of benefits in the form of a contingent annuitant option. Such earned pension program benefit value could otherwise have changed because of the reduction in mortality factors and potentially rising interest rates.\nThe values shown in this Table for the Named Executive Officers were based on benefit payments on the actual ages or the earliest possible ages for retirement with unreduced benefits for the Named Executive Officers: Mr. Judge: age 60, Mr. Lembo, age: 62, Mr. Schweiger: age 55, Mr. Nolan: age 62 and Mr. Butler: age 62.\nIn addition, we determined benefits under the qualified pension program using tax code limits in effect on December 31, 2020. For Messrs. Judge, Lembo, Schweiger and Nolan, the values shown reflect actual 2020 salary and annual incentives earned in 2019 but paid in 2020 (per applicable supplemental program rules). For Mr. Butler, the values shown reflect actual 2020 salary and annual incentives earned in 2020 but paid in 2021 (per applicable supplemental program rules).\nWe determined the present value of benefits at retirement age using the discount rate within a range of 2.48 percent to 2.54 percent under ACS 715-30 pension accounting for the 2020 fiscal year end measurement as of December 31, 2020. This present value assumes no pre-retirement mortality, turnover or disability. However, for the postretirement period beginning at retirement age, we used the 2020 IRS lump sum mortality table for Messrs. Judge, Lembo, Schweiger and Nolan. We used the RP2014 Employee Table Projected Generationally with Scale MP2020 for Mr. Butler. This new mortality table (as published by the Society of Actuaries in 2014) and projection scale were used by the Eversource Pension Plan for year-end 2020 financial disclosure. Additional assumptions appear in the footnotes to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION IN 2020\nThe following table reports amounts contributed in 2020, together with aggregate earnings on contributions and withdrawals or distributions on contributions in 2020, under the Eversource deferred compensation program, along with aggregate balances on contributions. See the narrative above in the CD&A under the caption \u201cOther Benefits - Deferred Compensation\u201d for more detail on our non-qualified deferred compensation program.\n(1) Includes the total market value of deferred compensation program balances at December 31, 2020, plus the value of vested RSUs or other awards for which the distribution of common shares is currently deferred, based on $86.51, the closing price of Eversource common shares on December 31, 2020, the last trading day of the year. The aggregate balances reflect a significant level of earnings on previously earned and deferred compensation.\nPOTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL\nThe discussion and tables below show compensation payable to each Named Executive Officer who is still an employee of Eversource, in the event of: (i) voluntary termination; (ii) involuntary not-for-cause termination; (iii) termination in the event of death or disability; and (iv) termination following a change in control. No amounts are payable in the event of a termination for cause. The amounts shown assume that each termination was effective as of December 31, 2020, the last business day of the fiscal year.\nGenerally, a \u201cchange in control\u201d means a change in ownership or control effected through (i) the acquisition of 30 percent or more of the combined voting power of common shares or other voting securities (20 percent for Mr. Butler, excluding certain defined transactions); (ii) the acquisition of more than 50 percent of Eversource common shares, excluding certain defined transactions (for Messrs. Judge, Lembo, Schweiger and Nolan); (iii) a change in the majority of the Eversource Board of Trustees, unless approved by a majority of the incumbent Trustees; (iv) certain reorganizations, mergers or consolidations where substantially all of the persons who were the beneficial owners of the outstanding common shares immediately prior to such business combination do not beneficially own more than 50 percent of the voting power of the resulting business entity (excluding in certain cases defined transactions); and (v) complete liquidation or dissolution of Eversource, or a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Eversource other than, for Mr. Butler, to an entity with respect to which following completion of the transaction more than 50 percent of common shares or other voting securities is then owned by all or substantially all of the persons who were the beneficial owners of common shares and other voting securities immediately prior to such transaction.\nIn the event of a change in control, the Named Executive Officers are generally entitled to receive compensation and benefits following either involuntary termination of employment without \u201ccause\u201d or voluntary termination of employment for \u201cgood reason\u201d within the applicable period (generally two years following a change in control). The Compensation Committee believes that termination for good reason is conceptually the same as termination \u201cwithout cause\u201d and, in the absence of this provision, potential acquirers would have an incentive to constructively terminate executives to avoid paying severance. Termination for \u201ccause\u201d generally means termination due to a felony or certain other convictions; fraud, embezzlement, or theft in the course of employment; intentional, wrongful damage to Eversource property; gross misconduct or gross negligence in the course of employment or gross neglect of duties harmful to Eversource; or a material breach of obligations under the agreement. \u201cGood reason\u201d for termination generally exists after assignment of duties inconsistent with executive\u2019s position, a material reduction in compensation or benefits, a transfer more than 50 miles from the executive\u2019s pre-change in control principal business location (or for Messrs. Judge, Lembo, Schweiger and Nolan, an involuntary transfer outside the greater Boston metropolitan area), or requiring business travel to a substantially greater extent than required prior to the change in control.\nThe summaries above do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the actual terms and provisions of the agreements and plans, copies of which have been filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPayments Upon Termination\nRegardless of the manner in which the employment of a Named Executive Officer terminates, the executive is entitled to receive certain amounts earned during the executive\u2019s term of employment. Such amounts include:\n\u2022Vested RSUs and certain other vested awards;\n\u2022Amounts contributed and any vested matching contributions under the deferred compensation program;\n\u2022Pay for unused vacation; and\n\u2022Amounts accrued and vested under the pension/supplemental and 401k programs (except in the event of a termination for cause under the supplemental program).\nThe following table describes additional compensation payable to the Named Executive Officers in the event of voluntary termination, involuntary termination not for cause, termination in the event of death or disability and termination following a change in control. No benefits are provided in the event of termination for cause. See the section above captioned \u201cPension Benefits in 2020\u201d for information about the pension program, supplemental program and other benefits, and the section captioned \u201cNonqualified Deferred Compensation in 2020.\u201d\nPOST-EMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION\n(1) For Termination Following a Change in Control: Represents target 2020 annual incentive awards as described in the Grants of Plan Based Awards Table.\n(2) For Voluntary Termination and Termination Not For Cause, and Termination Upon Death or Disability: Represents 100 percent of the performance share awards under the 2018 - 2020 Long-Term Incentive Program, 67 percent of the performance share awards under the 2019 - 2021 Long-Term Incentive Program and 33 percent of the performance share awards under the 2020 - 2022 Long-Term Incentive Program. The values were calculated by multiplying the number of RSUs by $86.51, the closing price of Eversource common shares on December 31, 2020, the last trading day of the year. For Termination Following a Change in Control: Represents 100 percent of the performance share awards under each of the three Programs noted in the previous two sentences.\n(3) For Voluntary Termination and Termination Not For Cause, and Termination Upon Death or Disability: Represents values of RSUs granted under our long-term incentive programs that, at year-end 2020, were unvested under applicable vesting schedules. Under these programs, RSUs vest pro rata based on credited service years and age at termination, and time worked during the vesting period. For all, the values were calculated by multiplying the number of RSUs by $86.51, the closing price of Eversource common shares on December 31, 2020, the last trading day of the year. For Termination Following a Change in Control: Represents values of all RSUs granted under our long-term incentive programs that, at year-end 2020, were unvested under applicable vesting schedules, all of which vest in full.\n(4) The amount noted in the Involuntary Termination, Not for Cause: Represents for Mr. Butler actuarial present values at year-end 2020 of amounts payable (two years of service) solely under an employment agreement upon termination, which are in addition to amounts due under the pension plan. For Termination Following a Change in Control: Represents actuarial present values at year-end 2020 of amounts payable solely under employment agreements upon termination (which are in addition to amounts due under the pension program). For Messrs. Judge, Schweiger, Nolan and Butler, pension benefits were calculated by adding three years of service (two years for Mr. Lembo). A lump sum of this benefit value is payable to Messrs. Judge, Lembo, Schweiger and Nolan. Pension amounts shown in the table are present values at year-end 2020 of benefits payable upon termination as described with respect to the Pension Benefits Table above.\n(5) The amount noted in the Involuntary Termination, Not for Cause: Represents for Mr. Butler the value of two years\u2019 employer contributions toward active health, long-term disability, and life insurance benefits, plus a payment to offset any taxes thereon. For Termination Following a Change in Control: represents estimated cost to Eversource at year-end 2020 (estimated by consultants) of providing post-employment health and welfare benefits beyond those available to non-executives upon involuntary termination. The amounts shown in the table for Messrs. Judge, Schweiger and Nolan represent the value of three years (two years for Mr. Lembo) of continued health and welfare plan participation. The amounts shown in the table for Mr. Butler represent the value of three years of employer contributions toward active health, long-term disability, and life insurance benefits, plus a payment to offset any taxes on the value of these benefits, less the value of one year of retiree health coverage at retiree rates.\n(6) The amount noted for Involuntary Termination, Not for Cause: Represents the cost to Eversource of reimbursing Mr. Butler for two years of financial planning and tax preparation fees. The amounts noted for Termination Following a Change in Control: Represents the cost to Eversource of reimbursing Messrs. Judge, Schweiger, Nolan and Butler for three years (two years for Mr. Lembo) of financial planning and tax preparation fees.\n(7) For Termination Following a Change in Control: Represents payments made to offset costs associated with certain excise taxes under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. Executives may be subject to certain excise taxes under Section 280G if they receive payments and benefits related to a Termination Following a Change in Control that exceed specified Internal Revenue Service limits. Contractual agreements with the above executives provide for a grossed-up reimbursement of these excise taxes. The amounts in the table are based on the Section 280G excise tax rate of 20 percent, the statutory federal income tax withholding rate of 35 percent, the applicable state income tax rate, and the Medicare tax rate of 1.45 percent.\n(8) For Involuntary Termination, Not for Cause: Represents for Mr. Butler a severance payment (two-times the sum of base salary plus relevant annual incentive award) in addition to any non-compete agreement payment described above. For Termination Following a Change in Control: Represents severance payments in addition to any non-compete agreement payments described in the prior note. For Messrs. Judge, Schweiger and Nolan, this payment equals three-times the sum of base salary plus relevant annual incentive award (two-times the sum for Messrs. Lembo and Butler.) These payments do not replace, offset or otherwise affect the calculation or payment of the annual incentive awards.\n(9) For Involuntary Termination, Not For Cause and Termination Following a Change in Control: Represents payments made under agreements or Eversource programs to Mr. Butler as consideration for agreement not to compete with Eversource following termination of employment, equal to the sum of base salary plus relevant annual incentive award. These payments do not replace, offset or otherwise affect the calculation or payment of the annual incentive awards.\nPAY RATIO\nEversource's Chief Executive Officer to median employee pay ratio is calculated pursuant to the requirements of Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. Eversource identifies a new median employee each year. For 2020, Eversource identified the median employee by reviewing the 2020 total cash compensation of all full-time employees, excluding Eversource\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by Eversource and its subsidiaries on December 31, 2020. In Eversource\u2019s assessment of median employee compensation, pay was annualized for those employees who commenced work during 2020. Otherwise, no assumptions, adjustments, or estimates were made with respect to total cash compensation, and the compensation for any full-time employees who were not employed by Eversource at the end of 2020 was not annualized. Eversource believes the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure, as Eversource does not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees.\nAfter identifying the median employee based on total cash compensation, Eversource calculated the annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology used for its Named Executive Officers as set forth in the 2020 Summary Compensation Table.\nMr. Judge had 2020 annual total compensation of $14,575,276, as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table. Eversource\u2019s median employee\u2019s annual total compensation for 2020 was $140,054. Eversource\u2019s 2020 Chief Executive Officer to median employee pay ratio is 104 to 1.",

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\nEversource Energy\nIncorporated herein by reference is the information contained in the sections captioned \"Trustee Independence\" and \"Related Person Transactions\" of Eversource Energy's definitive proxy statement for solicitation of proxies, expected to be filed with the SEC on or about March 26, 2021.\nNSTAR ELECTRIC and PSNH\nCertain information required by this Item 13 has been omitted for NSTAR Electric and PSNH pursuant to Instruction I(2)(c) to Form 10-K, Omission of Information by Certain Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries.\nCL&P\nEversource Energy's Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers applies to the Senior Financial Officers (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Controller) of Eversource Energy, CL&P and certain other Eversource Energy subsidiaries. Under the Code, one's position as a Senior Financial Officer in the company may not be used to improperly benefit such officer or his or her family or friends. Under the Code, specific activities that may be considered conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to, directly or indirectly acquiring or retaining a significant financial interest in an organization that is a customer, vendor or competitor, or that seeks to do business with the company; serving, without proper safeguards, as an officer or director of, or working or rendering services for an organization that is a customer, vendor or competitor, or that seeks to do business with the company. Waivers of the provisions of the Code of Ethics for Trustees, executive officers or directors must be approved by Eversource Energy's Board of Trustees. Any such waivers will be disclosed pursuant to legal requirements.\nEversource Energy's Code of Conduct, which applies to all Trustees, directors, officers and employees of Eversource Energy and its subsidiaries, including CL&P, contains a Conflict of Interest Policy that requires all such individuals to disclose any potential conflicts of interest. Such individuals are expected to discuss their particular situations with management to ensure appropriate steps are in place to avoid a conflict of interest. All disclosures must be reviewed and approved by management to ensure a particular situation does not adversely impact the individual's primary job and role.\nEversource Energy's Related Persons Transactions Policy is administered by the Corporate Governance Committee of Eversource Energy's Board of Trustees. The Policy generally defines a \"Related Persons Transaction\" as any transaction or series of transactions in which (i) Eversource Energy or a subsidiary is a participant, (ii) the aggregate amount involved exceeds $120,000 and (iii) any \"Related Persons\" has a direct or indirect material interest. A \"Related Persons\" is defined as any Trustee or nominee for Trustee, any executive officer, any shareholder owning more than 5 percent of Eversource Energy's total outstanding shares, and any immediate family member of any such person. Management submits to the Corporate Governance Committee for consideration any Related Persons Transaction into which Eversource Energy or a subsidiary proposes to enter. The Corporate Governance Committee recommends to the Eversource Energy Board of Trustees for approval only those transactions that are in Eversource Energy's best interests. If management causes the company to enter into a Related Persons Transaction prior to approval by the Corporate Governance Committee, the transaction will be subject to ratification by the Eversource Energy Board of Trustees. If the Eversource Energy Board of Trustees determines not to ratify the transaction, then management will make all reasonable efforts to cancel or annul such transaction.\nThe directors of CL&P are employees of CL&P and/or other subsidiaries of Eversource Energy, and thus are not considered independent.",

Principal Accountant Fees and Services\nEversource Energy\nIncorporated herein by reference is the information contained in the section \"Relationship with Independent Auditors\" of Eversource Energy's definitive proxy statement for solicitation of proxies, expected to be filed with the SEC on or about March 26, 2021.\nCL&P, NSTAR ELECTRIC and PSNH\nPre-Approval of Services Provided by Principal Auditors\nNone of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH is subject to the audit committee requirements of the SEC, the national securities exchanges or the national securities associations. CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH obtain audit services from the independent auditor engaged by the Audit Committee of Eversource Energy's Board of Trustees. Eversource Energy's Audit Committee has established policies and procedures regarding the pre-approval of services provided by the principal auditors. Those policies and procedures delegate pre-approval of services to the Eversource Energy Audit Committee Chair provided that such offices are held by Trustees who are \"independent\" within the meaning of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and that all such pre-approvals are presented to the Eversource Energy Audit Committee at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee.\nThe following relates to fees and services for the entire Eversource Energy system, including Eversource Energy, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH.\nFees Billed By Principal Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe aggregate fees billed to the Company and its subsidiaries by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, and their respective affiliates (collectively, the Deloitte Entities), for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $5,296,414 and $5,641,614, respectively. In addition, affiliates of Deloitte & Touche LLP as noted below provide other accounting services to the Company.\n(1) Audit fees in 2020 and 2019 consisted of fees related to the audits of financial statements of Eversource Energy and its subsidiaries, reviews of financial statements in the Combined Quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of Eversource Energy and its subsidiaries, consultations with management, regulatory and compliance filings, out of pocket expense reimbursements, and audits of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(2) Audit Related Fees were incurred for procedures performed in the ordinary course of business in support of certain regulatory filings, comfort letters, consents, and other costs related to registration statements and financials for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(3) There were no tax fees rendered and no tax fees billed for the year ended December 31, 2020. The tax service fees for the period ended December 31, 2019 were incurred for procedures performed in the ordinary course of business in support of certain federal rules in 2019.\n(4) All Other Fees for the period December 31, 2020 and 2019 were for an annual license for access to an accounting standards research tool.\nThe Audit Committee pre-approves all auditing services and permitted audit-related or other services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for us by our independent registered public accounting firm, subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are approved by the Audit Committee prior to the completion of the audit. The Audit Committee may form and delegate its authority to subcommittees consisting of one or more members when appropriate, including the authority to grant pre-approvals of audit and permitted non-audit services, provided that decisions of such subcommittees to grant pre-approvals are presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. During 2020, all services described above were pre-approved by the Audit Committee or its Chair.\nThe Audit Committee has considered whether the provision by the Deloitte Entities of the non-audit services described above was allowed under Rule 2-01(c)(4) of Regulation S-X and was compatible with maintaining the independence of the registered public accountants and has concluded that the Deloitte Entities were and are independent of us in all respects.\nPART IV",
