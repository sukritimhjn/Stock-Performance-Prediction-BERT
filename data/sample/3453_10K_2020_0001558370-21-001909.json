    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nA. COMPANY OVERVIEW\nMatson, Inc., a holding company incorporated in the State of Hawaii, and its subsidiaries (\u201cMatson\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), is a leading provider of ocean transportation and logistics services. The Company consists of two segments, Ocean Transportation and Logistics. For financial information by segment for the three years ended December 31, 2020, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below.\nOcean Transportation: Matson\u2019s Ocean Transportation business is conducted through Matson Navigation Company, Inc. (\u201cMatNav\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Matson, Inc. Founded in 1882, MatNav provides a vital lifeline of ocean freight transportation services to the domestic non-contiguous economies of Hawaii, Alaska and Guam, and to other island economies in Micronesia. MatNav also operates two premium, expedited services from China to Long Beach, California, and provides services to Okinawa, Japan and various islands in the South Pacific, and operates an international export service from Dutch Harbor to Asia.

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION\n(1)\nOCEAN TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT\nOcean Transportation Services:\nMatson\u2019s Ocean Transportation segment provides the following services:\nHawaii Service: Matson\u2019s Hawaii service provides ocean carriage (lift-on/lift-off, roll-on/roll-off and conventional services) between the ports of Long Beach and Oakland, California; Tacoma, Washington; and Honolulu, Hawaii. Matson also operates a network of inter-island barges that provide connecting services from its hub at Honolulu to other major Hawaii ports on the islands of Hawaii, Maui and Kauai. Matson is the largest carrier of ocean cargo between the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii.\nWestbound cargo carried by Matson to Hawaii includes dry containers of mixed commodities, refrigerated commodities, packaged foods and beverages, retail merchandise, building materials, automobiles and household goods. Matson\u2019s eastbound cargo from Hawaii includes automobiles, household goods, dry containers of mixed commodities and livestock. The majority of Matson\u2019s Hawaii service revenue is derived from the westbound carriage of containerized freight.\nChina Service: Matson\u2019s expedited China-Long Beach Express (\u201cCLX\u201d) service is part of an integrated service that carries cargo from Long Beach, California to Honolulu, Hawaii, to Guam, and then to Okinawa, Japan. The vessels continue to Ningbo and Shanghai, China, where they are loaded with cargo to be discharged primarily in Long Beach, California at a Matson-exclusive terminal, operated by SSAT. These vessels also carry cargo destined for Hawaii which originated in Guam, Micronesia, Japan and China. Matson provides container transshipment services from many locations in Asia including Hong Kong and Xiamen, China to the U.S. via the ports of Ningbo and Shanghai, China.\nIn May 2020, as a result of increased market demand, Matson launched its new China-Long Beach Express Plus (\u201cCLX+\u201d) service. CLX+ vessels operate as a second weekly vessel from China to Long Beach, California, operating back-to-back with the CLX vessels, which together represent Matson\u2019s expedited China service.\nEastbound cargo from China to Long Beach, California consists mainly of garments, e-commerce, consumer electronics, footwear and other merchandise. On our CLX service, westbound cargo to China and other destinations in Asia consists mainly of recycling materials.\nGuam Service: Matson\u2019s Guam service provides weekly carriage between the U.S West Coast and Guam, as part of its CLX service. Matson also provides weekly connecting service from Guam to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Cargo destined to these markets is similar to that described under \u201cHawaii Service\u201d above.\nJapan Service: Matson\u2019s Japan service provides carriage to the port of Naha in Okinawa, Japan, as part of its CLX service. This service carries mainly general sustenance cargo and household goods supporting the U.S. military.\nMicronesia Service: Matson\u2019s Micronesia service provides carriage between the U.S. West Coast and the islands of Kwajalein, Ebeye and Majuro in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the islands of Yap, Pohnpei, Chuuk and Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau. Cargo destined for these locations is transshipped through Guam and consists mainly of general sustenance cargo.\nAlaska Service: Matson\u2019s Alaska service provides ocean carriage (lift-on/lift-off and conventional services) between the port of Tacoma, Washington, and the ports of Anchorage, Kodiak and Dutch Harbor, Alaska. Matson also provides a barge service between Dutch Harbor and Akutan in Alaska, and transportation services to other locations in Alaska including the Kenai Peninsula, Fairbanks and the North Slope.\nNorthbound cargo to Alaska consists mainly of dry containers of mixed commodities, refrigerated commodities, packaged foods and beverages, retail merchandise, household goods and automobiles. Southbound cargo from Alaska primarily consists of seafood, household goods and automobiles.\nIn September 2020, Matson launched its new Alaska-Asia Express (\u201cAAX\u201d) service that provides carriage of dry and frozen seafood from Dutch Harbor, Alaska to Ningbo and Shanghai, China. The AAX service utilizes CLX+ vessels on their westbound trip to China. Matson also provides transshipment services from Ningbo and Shanghai, China to other locations in Asia. Other Alaska cargo may be shipped on the AAX service utilizing Matson\u2019s Alaska vessels and transshipment services in Dutch Harbor.\nSouth Pacific Service: Matson\u2019s New Zealand Express (\u201cNZX\u201d) service provides carriage of general sustenance cargo between Auckland, New Zealand and select islands in the South Pacific, including Fiji (Suva and Lautoka), Samoa (Apia), American Samoa (Pago Pago), the Cook Islands (Rarotonga and Aitutaki), Tonga (Nukualofa and Vava\u2019u), and Niue. Matson\u2019s NZX service also provides transshipment services to the islands of Nauru and the Solomon Islands (Honiara). Additionally, Matson provides slot charter arrangements for the transportation of cargo from major ports on the east coast of Australia to ports in the South Pacific islands. The NZX service also distributes and sells domestic bulk fuel to a variety of these islands.\nMatson\u2019s South Pacific Express (\u201cSPX\u201d) service provides carriage of general sustenance cargo from the U.S. West Coast to ports in the South Pacific islands using vessel sharing agreements with other carriers. The SPX service provides direct calls to Tahiti (Papeete), American Samoa (Pago Pago) and Samoa (Apia) in the South Pacific. Cargo destined for other ports including Tonga (Nukualofa) and the Cook Islands (Rarotonga and Aitutaki) is then transshipped in Apia, Samoa to the NZX service for delivery to its final destination. Northbound SPX cargo originating in the South Pacific is transshipped from the NZX service with other carriers to the U.S. West Coast. Cargo destined for Hawaii or Washington is further transshipped in Oakland, California for delivery to its final destination.\nTerminal and Other Related Services:\nMatson provides stevedoring, refrigerated cargo services, inland transportation, container equipment maintenance and other terminal services (collectively, \u201cterminal services\u201d) at terminals located on the Hawaiian islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui and Kauai; and in the Alaska terminal locations of Anchorage, Kodiak and Dutch Harbor.\nSSAT currently provides terminal and stevedoring services to various carriers at seven terminal facilities on the U.S. West Coast, including three facilities dedicated for MatNav\u2019s use, in Long Beach and Oakland, California; and in Tacoma, Washington.\nMatson utilizes the services of other third-party terminal operators at all of the other ports served by its vessels.\nVessel Management Services:\nMatson contracts with the U.S. Department of Transportation to provide vessel management services to manage and maintain three Ready Reserve Force vessels on behalf of the U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration.\nVessel Information:\nVessels:\nMatson\u2019s fleet includes both owned and chartered vessels. Matson\u2019s owned vessels represent an investment of approximately $2.2 billion. The majority of Matson\u2019s owned vessels are U.S. flagged and Jones Act qualified vessels,\nand operate in the Hawaii, China, Guam, Japan, Micronesia and Alaska services. Details of Matson\u2019s active and reserve vessels as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\n(1) Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (\u201cTEU\u201d) is a standard measure of cargo volume correlated to a standard 20-foot dry cargo container.\n(2) Vessel Design Speed may vary from the operating speed of the vessel.\n(3) U.S. flagged and Jones Act qualified vessel or barge.\n(4) U.S. flagged vessel.\n(5) Foreign flagged vessel.\n(6) Lift-on/lift-off barge equipped with a crane.\n(7) Roll-on/roll-off barge.\n(8) Vessel installed with exhaust gas cleaning systems (commonly referred to as \u201cscrubbers\u201d).\n(9) Vessels used in the CLX+ service are chartered and may be replaced by other similar vessels.\nFleet Renewal Program:\nMatson has completed its investment of $1,024 million in the construction of four new vessels, including owner\u2019s items and capitalized interest. The two Aloha Class containerships, Daniel K. Inouye and Kaimana Hila, commenced active service in November 2018 and April 2019, respectively. The two Kanaloa Class combination container and roll-on/roll-off vessels, Lurline and Matsonia commenced active service in January 2020 and December 2020, respectively.\nVessel Emission Regulations:\nBeing a leader in environmental stewardship is one of Matson\u2019s core values. Matson\u2019s vessels transit through some of the most environmentally sensitive areas in the United States including the Hawaiian Islands and the coasts of California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. Matson is focused in particular on reducing transportation emissions, including carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide through improvements in vessel fuel consumption and the development of more fuel-efficient transportation solutions. Matson further contributes positively to the environment by testing and deploying leading technologies as the fleet is modernized.\nThe International Maritime Organization (\u201cIMO\u201d), to which the U.S. and over 100 other countries are signatories, is a specialized agency of the United Nations that sets international environmental standards applicable to vessels operating under the flag of any signatory country. Effective January 1, 2020, the IMO imposed regulations that generally require all vessels to burn fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of \u22640.5 percent (\u201cIMO 2020\u201d). There are three main options for a vessel to meet the IMO 2020 requirements: (1) burn low sulfur fuel oil (\u201cLSFO\u201d), (2) install exhaust gas cleaning systems (commonly referred to as \u201cscrubbers\u201d) on vessels to reduce sulfur emissions from high sulfur fuel oil (\u201cHSFO\u201d), or (3) switch to lower emission fuels such as liquefied natural gas (\u201cLNG\u201d), which requires converting existing vessels or constructing new vessels with LNG-compatible engines and fuel tanks. With respect to North America, all waters, with certain limited exceptions, within 200 nautical miles of U.S. and Canadian coastlines have been designated emission control areas (\u201cECAs\u201d). Since January 1, 2015, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations have reduced the fuel oil maximum sulfur content in designated ECAs to \u22640.1 percent or the equivalent emissions by the use of scrubbers. In addition, since August 1, 2012, the California Air Resource Board and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Vessel General Permit regulations have reduced the fuel oil maximum sulfur content to \u22640.1 percent within 24 miles of the California coastline and within Puget Sound.\nAll of Matson\u2019s vessels in the Alaska and Hawaii services are operating in compliance with IMO 2020 and ECA regulations as applicable, and can use LSFO. In the Alaska and Hawaii services, Matson installed scrubbers on nine diesel-powered vessels to allow them to use HSFO and still comply with IMO 2020 and ECA regulations. Matson also maintains two reserve vessels which may operate as dry-dock relief or for emergency activation purposes under an approved ECA permit enabling the use of fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of \u22640.5 percent within the North America ECA. Matson\u2019s new Aloha and Kanaloa Class vessels burn compliant LSFO. These new vessels are also equipped with dual-fuel engines and can be converted to run on LNG. All of Matson\u2019s other vessels use LSFO to meet IMO 2020 and ECA emission standards.\nHawaii Terminal Modernization and Expansion Program:\nMatson has completed the first phase of modernizing and renovating its terminal facility at Sand Island, Honolulu, Hawaii, an investment of approximately $60 million. In 2020, Matson completed the installation of three new 65 long-ton capacity gantry cranes, upgraded and renovated three existing cranes, demolished four outdated cranes, and installed upgrades to the electrical infrastructure at the terminal. As part of the second phase, Matson expects to install a new redundant main switchgear, complete the augmentation of its existing backup power generators, install new fuel storage tanks and a battery energy storage system, and perform other upgrades at the terminal. Matson expects to begin the second phase during the second half of 2021 and to complete it within two years. The final phase is expected to begin in 2024 as part of a broader terminal expansion and modernization program at the terminal.\nOcean Transportation Equipment:\nAs a complement to its fleet of vessels, Matson owns a variety of equipment including cranes, terminal equipment, containers and chassis, which represents an investment of approximately $0.6 billion as of December 31, 2020. Matson also leases containers, chassis and other equipment under various operating lease agreements.\nOperating Costs:\nMajor components of Matson\u2019s Ocean Transportation operating costs are as follows:\nDirect Cargo Expense includes terminal handling costs including labor, purchased outside transportation and other related costs.\nVessel Operating Expense includes crew wages and related costs; fuel, pilots, tugs and line related costs; vessel charter expenses; and other vessel operating related expenses. Matson purchases fuel oil, lubricants and gasoline for its operations and also pays fuel-related surcharges to other third party transportation providers.\nOperating Overhead includes equipment repair costs, equipment lease and repositioning expenses, vessel repair and maintenance costs, depreciation and dry-docking amortization, insurance, port engineers and other maintenance costs, and other vessel and shoreside related overhead.\nCompetition:\nThe following is a summary of major competitors in Matson\u2019s Ocean Transportation segment:\nHawaii Service: Matson\u2019s Hawaii service has one major U.S. flagged Jones Act competitor, Pasha Hawaii (\u201cPasha\u201d), which operates container and roll-on/roll-off services between the ports of Long Beach, Oakland and San Diego, California to Hawaii. A U.S. flagged Jones Act barge operator, Aloha Marine Lines, also offers barge service between the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii.\nForeign-flagged vessels carrying cargo to Hawaii from non-U.S. locations also provide alternatives for companies shipping to Hawaii. Other competitors in the Hawaii service include proprietary operators and contract carriers of bulk cargo. Airfreight competition for time-sensitive cargo exists; however, cargo volume has been limited primarily due to the cost of airfreight transportation.\nMatson operates three strings of vessels to Hawaii. These strings provide customers an industry-leading five departures from ports on the U.S. West Coast to Hawaii every week - two each from Long Beach and Oakland, California and one from Tacoma, Washington. Each of these strings operates on a fixed day-of-the-week schedule. One of the vessel strings continues from Honolulu on to Guam, Japan and China before returning to Long Beach. The remaining two strings offer eastbound Hawaii shippers twice weekly departures from Honolulu to the U.S. Mainland, providing customers service to the same three U.S. West Coast ports. Matson\u2019s frequent sailings and punctuality permit customers to reduce inventory carrying costs. Matson also competes by offering the most comprehensive service to customers, including: the only container service to and from the three largest U.S. West Coast ports; the most efficient terminal network on the U.S. West Coast provided by SSAT; a dedicated inter-island barge network which is integrated with Matson\u2019s line haul schedule; weekly roll-on roll-off service from Long Beach and Oakland; a world-class customer service team; and efficiency and experience in handling cargo of all types.\nAlaska Service: Matson\u2019s Alaska service has one major U.S. flagged Jones Act competitor, Totem Ocean Trailer Express, Inc., which operates a roll-on/roll off service between Tacoma, Washington and Anchorage, Alaska. There are also two U.S. flagged Jones Act barge operators, Alaska Marine Lines, which mainly provides services from Seattle, Washington to the ports of Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, and other locations in Alaska, and Samson Tug & Barge, which mainly serves Western Alaska and other locations. The barge operators have historically shipped lower value commodities that can accommodate a longer transit time, as well as construction materials and other cargo that are not conducive to movement in containers. Foreign-flagged vessels provide alternatives for companies shipping cargo (mainly seafood) from the Alaska ports of Kodiak and Dutch Harbor. Matson\u2019s AAX service has two major competitors, CMA CGM and Maersk Lines, which provide services between Dutch Harbor, Alaska and Asia.\nMatson offers customers twice weekly scheduled service from Tacoma, Washington to Anchorage and Kodiak, Alaska and weekly service to Dutch Harbor, Alaska. The Company also provides a barge service between Dutch Harbor and Akutan in Alaska. Matson is the only Jones Act containership operator providing service to Kodiak and Dutch Harbor in Alaska, which are the primary loading ports for southbound seafood. Matson offers dedicated terminal services at the Alaska ports of Anchorage, Kodiak and Dutch Harbor performed by MatNav, and at the port of Tacoma, Washington performed by SSAT.\nChina Service: Major competitors to Matson\u2019s China service include large international carriers such as ONE (formerly \u201cK\u201d Line, NYK Line and MOL), Maersk, CMA CGM, Evergreen, COSCO, and ZIM.\nMatson\u2019s China service competes by offering fast and reliable service from the ports of Ningbo and Shanghai in China to Long Beach, California, and providing fixed day arrivals and next-day cargo availability. Matson\u2019s service is further differentiated by SSAT\u2019s best-in-class stevedoring services, access to Shippers Transport Express and off-dock container\nyards enabling fast truck turn times, Matson-dedicated equipment including chassis to speed cargo availability, one-stop intermodal connections, and providing world-class customer service. Matson has offices located in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Ningbo and Shanghai, and has contracted with terminal operators in Ningbo and Shanghai.\nGuam Service: Matson\u2019s Guam service has one major competitor, APL, which operates a weekly U.S. flagged container feeder service connecting the U.S. West Coast to Guam and Saipan, via transshipments primarily over Busan, South Korea. Waterman operates a roll-on/roll-off service, which periodically calls at Guam. There are also several foreign carriers, including CMA CGM, that call at Guam from foreign origin ports.\nJapan Service: Matson\u2019s Japan service competes primarily with APL, which operates a weekly U.S. flagged containership service from the U.S. West Coast to the port of Naha, Okinawa, Japan.\nMicronesia and South Pacific Services: Matson\u2019s Micronesia and South Pacific services have competition from a variety of local and international carriers that provide freight services to the area.\nCustomer Concentration:\nMatson serves customers in numerous industries and carries a wide variety of cargo, mitigating its dependence upon any single customer or single type of cargo. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company\u2019s 10 largest Ocean Transportation customers accounted for approximately 22 percent, 23 percent and 24 percent of the Company\u2019s Ocean Transportation revenue, respectively. None of these customers individually account for more than 10 percent of Matson\u2019s Ocean Transportation operating revenues. For additional information on Ocean Transportation revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below.\nSeasonality:\nMatson\u2019s Ocean Transportation services typically experience seasonality in volume, generally following a pattern of increasing volumes starting in the second quarter of each year, culminating in a peak season throughout the third quarter, with subsequent decline in demand during the fourth and first quarters. This seasonality trend is amplified in the Alaska service primarily due to winter weather and the timing of southbound seafood trade. As a result, earnings tend to follow a similar pattern, offset by periodic vessel dry-docking and other episodic cost factors, which can lead to earnings variability. In addition, in the China trade, volume is typically driven primarily by U.S. consumer demand for goods during key retail selling seasons. Freight rates are impacted mainly by macro supply and demand variables.\nMaritime Laws and the Jones Act:\nMaritime Laws: All interstate and intrastate marine commerce within the U.S. falls under the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly referred to as the Jones Act).\nThe Jones Act is a long-standing cornerstone of U.S. maritime policy. Under the Jones Act, all vessels transporting cargo between covered U.S. ports must, subject to limited exceptions, be built in the U.S., registered under the U.S. flag, be manned predominantly by U.S. crews, and owned and operated by U.S.-organized companies that are controlled and 75 percent owned by U.S. citizens. U.S. flagged vessels are generally required to be maintained at higher standards than foreign flagged vessels and are subject to rigorous supervision and inspections by, or on behalf of, the U.S. Coast Guard, which requires appropriate certifications and background checks of the crew members. Under Section 27 of the Jones Act, the carriage of cargo between the U.S. West Coast, Hawaii and Alaska on foreign-built or foreign-documented vessels is prohibited.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately 62 percent, 72 percent and 72 percent, respectively, of Matson\u2019s Ocean Transportation revenues came from the Hawaii and Alaska trades that were subject to the Jones Act. Matson\u2019s Hawaii and Alaska trade routes are included within the non-contiguous Jones Act market. The commerce of both Hawaii, as an island economy, and Alaska, due to its geographical location, are dependent on ocean transportation. The Jones Act ensures frequent, reliable, roundtrip service to these locations. Matson\u2019s vessels operating in these trade routes are Jones Act qualified.\nMatson is a member of the American Maritime Partnership (\u201cAMP\u201d) which supports the retention of the Jones Act and similar cabotage laws. The Jones Act has broad support from both houses of Congress and the Executive Branch.\nMatson believes that the ongoing war on terrorism and geopolitical environment have further solidified political support for U.S. flagged vessels because a vital and dedicated U.S. merchant marine is a cornerstone for a strong homeland defense, as well as a critical source of trained U.S. mariners for wartime support. AMP seeks to inform elected officials and the public about the economic, national security, commercial, safety and environmental benefits of the Jones Act and similar cabotage laws. Repeal of the Jones Act would allow foreign-flagged vessel operators that do not have to abide by all U.S. laws and regulations to sail between U.S. ports in direct competition with Matson and other U.S. domestic operators that must comply with all such laws and regulations.\nOther U.S. maritime laws require vessels operating between Guam, a U.S. territory, and U.S. ports to be U.S. flagged and predominantly U.S. crewed, but not U.S. built.\nCabotage laws are not unique to the United States, and similar laws exist around the world in over 90 countries, including regions in which Matson provides ocean transportation services. Any changes in such laws may have an impact on the services provided by Matson in those regions. For a discussion of the risks arising from the Jones Act and other regulations, see Part I,",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following material factors, events and uncertainties may make an investment in the Company speculative or risky and should be reviewed carefully. The Company\u2019s business faces the material risks set forth below; however, these risk factors do not identify all risks the Company faces, and additional risks or uncertainties that are currently unknown or are not currently believed to be material may occur or become material. The occurrence of these or the events and uncertainties described below may, in ways the Company may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, demand, revenue, growth, prospects, reputation, or stock price. All forward-looking statements made by the Company or on the Company\u2019s behalf are qualified by the risks described below.\nRisks Related to the Jones Act\nRepeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or its application would have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly referred to as the Jones Act) regulates all interstate and intrastate marine commerce within the U.S. If the Jones Act was to be repealed, substantially amended, or waived and, as a consequence, competitors were to enter the Hawaii or Alaska markets with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flagged and foreign-built vessels and/or being exempt from other U.S. regulations, the Company\u2019s business would be adversely affected. In addition, the Company\u2019s position as a U.S. citizen operator of Jones Act vessels would be negatively impacted if periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act were ever successful. If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the U.S.-EU Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flagged or foreign-built vessels and could have other adverse impacts. In the past, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has suggested that the Jones Act should be a topic of trade negotiations between the U.S. and European Union.\nThe Company\u2019s business would be adversely affected if the Company were determined not to be a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.\nCertain provisions of the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation protect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain its status as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. If non-U.S. citizens were able to defeat such articles of incorporation restrictions and own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Company\u2019s common stock, the Company would no longer be considered as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. Such an event could result in the Company\u2019s ineligibility to engage in coastwise trade and the imposition of substantial penalties against it, including seizure or forfeiture of its vessels.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Operations\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its related economic effects.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has harmed the U.S. and global economies, shut down or limited many business operations and disrupted manufacturing, supply chains, travel, drayage of containers, and transportation of goods. In the United States and in many other countries worldwide, public health officials and state and local governments have recommended or mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The full impact of such disruptions on the Company\u2019s business remains uncertain.\nThe pandemic has severely reduced tourism and is expected to continue to limit tourism in the markets the Company serves, including Hawaii, Guam and Alaska, and has led to reduced demand for freight that the Company would otherwise carry. In addition, the global macroeconomic effects of the pandemic and related impacts on the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 business operations, including financial difficulties or bankruptcies, may persist for an indefinite period, even after the pandemic has subsided.\nIn the Company\u2019s China service, as a result of the pandemic, the Company has experienced increased demand for its expedited ocean services; however, as the pandemic subsides and supply and demand trends normalize, it is uncertain whether the high volumes and rates the Company has seen can be maintained in the future. In addition, the high volumes of freight from China have contributed to an industry-wide shortage of containers and chassis and congestion at U.S. West Coast ports. There have also been labor shortages at U.S. ports related to record cargo volume and outbreaks of COVID-19. If the Company cannot secure sufficient equipment or unload vessels on a timely basis to meet customer\u2019 needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by others on a temporary or permanent basis.\nThe Company\u2019s operations have also been impacted. The Company\u2019s employees are also restricted in their ability to travel. The Company may be further impacted if its employees are otherwise unable to perform their duties, including mariners aboard our vessels, or if the Company\u2019s terminals are temporarily closed due to a COVID-19 outbreak. Some vessel dry-dockings could also be delayed or become more expensive if shipyards are unable to accommodate demand or obtain parts or if necessary personnel are not allowed to travel to the shipyards.\nDue to the continuing uncertainty around the duration, breadth and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the potential for resurgences or mutations of the virus, the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, including the availability, distribution, efficacy and public acceptance of vaccines, and the impact of economic stimulus measures, the ultimate impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic may give rise to additional risks or instigate or amplify the other risks described throughout these Risk Factors.\nChanges in economic conditions or governmental policies have resulted in a decrease in consumer confidence and market demand for the Company\u2019s services and products in certain markets and have adversely affected the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows.\nWithin the U.S., a weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii and Alaska, which include tourism, military spending, construction starts, personal income growth and employment, the weakening of consumer confidence, market demand, and the economy in the U.S. Mainland, and the effect of a change in the strength of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, have reduced the demand for goods, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates. For example, the uncertainties regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and other restrictions have severely decreased tourism, weakened consumer demand in certain segments, increased unemployment, and contributed to an economic downturn in the U.S., impacting freight volumes and revenues. The decline in the price of oil due to the oil trade wars and reduced demand from the decline in air or car travel in response to COVID-19 will further impact the Alaska economy, which in turn could impact the Company\u2019s business. In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets, a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates, imposition of tariffs and uncertainties regarding tariff rates, or a change in international trade policies could adversely affect freight volumes and rates in the Company\u2019s China service.\nThe shipping industry is competitive and the Company has been impacted by new or increased competition.\nThe Company may face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter the Company\u2019s markets. The shipping industry is competitive with limited barriers to entry as ocean carriers can shift vessels in and out of tradelanes or charter vessels to manage capacity and meet customer demands. For example, in May 2020, the Company\u2019s major competitor in the China service upsized its expedited service from China to the U.S. West Coast. The entry of a new competitor or the addition of new vessels or capacity by existing competition on any of the Company\u2019s routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s volumes and rates.\nThe loss of or damage to key customer or agent relationships may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are dependent on their relationships with customers and agents, and derive a significant portion of their revenues from the Company\u2019s largest customers. The Company\u2019s business relies on its relationships with the U.S. military, freight forwarders, large retailers and consumer goods and automobile manufacturers, as well as other larger customers. For more information regarding the Company\u2019s significant customers, see the discussion in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.\nThe Company could also be adversely affected by any changes in the services, or changes to the costs of services, provided by third party vendors such as railroads, terminals, agents and shipping companies, including charter vessel owners. Service structures and relationships with these parties are important in the Company\u2019s intermodal business, as well as in the China, Guam, Micronesia, Japan, Alaska export and South Pacific services.\nThe loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and revenue.\nThe Company is dependent upon key vendors and third-parties for equipment, capacity and services essential to operate its business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third-party services, its business could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are dependent upon key vendors who provide rail, truck and ocean transportation services. If the Company cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third-parties at reasonable prices or rates to meet its or its customers\u2019 needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by others on a temporary or permanent basis. If this were to occur, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAn increase in fuel prices, changes in the Company\u2019s ability to collect fuel-related surcharges, and/or the cost or limited availability of required fuels on the U.S. West Coast may adversely affect the Company\u2019s profits.\nFuel is a significant operating expense for the Company\u2019s Ocean Transportation business. The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. Increases in fuel costs also can lead to increases in other expenses, such as energy costs and costs to purchase outside transportation services. In the Company\u2019s Ocean Transportation and Logistics services segments, the Company utilizes fuel-related surcharges, although increases in the fuel-related surcharge may adversely affect the Company\u2019s competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense. Changes in the Company\u2019s ability to collect fuel-related surcharges also may adversely affect its results of operations.\nEffective January 1, 2020, the IMO imposed a world-wide regulation generally requiring that all ships burn compliant fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of less than or equal to 0.5 percent. Currently, LSFO is typically priced higher than HSFO due to the need for further oil refinement. In some market instances, the prices between the two products could be inverted. There is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s contracts to secure LSFO on the U.S. West Coast will secure quantities in sufficient amounts and at a reasonable cost. In addition, prolonged use of LSFO on some Matson vessels could degrade engine performance or lead to higher maintenance costs. There may also be delays or other unexpected complications in connection with Matson\u2019s announced plans to install a scrubber on at least one additional vessel. The Company\u2019s ability to recover the higher costs of IMO 2020 compliant fuel through fuel-related surcharges, the availability of LSFO, and the potential impact on vessel performance may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations, business and profit.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are susceptible to weather, natural disasters, maritime accidents, spill events and other operating risks.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather, natural disasters and other climate-driven events, such as bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes, as well as a maritime accident, oil or other spill, or other environmental mishap. Climate change has increased and may continue to increase the frequency, severity and uncertainty of such events. Such events interfere with the Company\u2019s ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interference with the Company\u2019s terminal operations and may cause serious damage to its vessels and cranes. These impacts could be particularly acute in certain ports in Alaska where the Company is dependent on a single crane. The Company\u2019s vessels and their cargoes are also subject to operating risks such as mechanical failure, collisions and human error.\nThe occurrence of any of these events may result in damage to or loss of vessels, containers, cargo and other equipment, loss of life or physical injury to its employees or people, pollution and suspension of operations. These events can expose the Company to reputational harm and liability for resulting damages and possible penalties that, pursuant to typical maritime industry policies, it must pay and then seek reimbursement from its insurer. Affected vessels may also be removed from service and thus would be unavailable for income-generating activity.\nThe Company\u2019s casualty and liability insurance policies are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles and may not cover all losses the Company may incur. Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from a port blockage, generally, are not insured. In some cases the Company retains the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk. Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available. Finally, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance.\nIn addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company faces risks related to actual or threatened health epidemics, pandemics or other major health crises, which could significantly disrupt the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be impacted adversely by the effects of public health epidemics, pandemics or other major heath crises (which the Company refers to collectively as public health crises). Actual or threatened public health crises may have a number of adverse impacts, including volatility in the global economy, impacts to the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 business operations, reduced tourism in the markets the Company serves, or significant disruptions in ocean-borne transportation of goods, logistics demand and supply chain activity, caused by a variety of factors such as quarantines, factory and office closures, port closures, or other government-imposed restrictions, any of which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced when they expire.\nThe significant operating agreements and leases entered into by the Company in its businesses, including those related to terminals, chartered vessels and warehouses as well as those with SSAT, expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, thereby adversely affecting the Company\u2019s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For example, on November 26, 2018, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into agreements whereby Maunalei, a U.S. flagged and Jones Act qualified vessel, was sold for $106.0 million and leased back from the buyer under an operating lease agreement. The customary representations, warranties and covenants contained in the agreements do not eliminate the risks that (a) the lessor could lose its Jones Act status, (b) the Company could not replace Maunalei in the event it is no longer Jones Act eligible, or (c) if the repurchase option is elected, the Company would not be able to consummate the repurchase of Maunalei at the end of the lease term.\nThe Company may face unexpected dry-docking or repair costs for its vessels.\nThe Company routinely engage shipyards to dry-dock its vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance. Vessels may also have to be dry-docked or repaired at sea in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. Unexpected dry-dockings or repairs could require the Company to activate a reserve vessel, purchase additional fuel and operate a less-efficient, smaller vessel for a period of time. The Company also operates a number of\nolder active and reserve vessels that may require more frequent and extensive maintenance. The cost of repairs are difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors, including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements, and accordingly, the length of time that a vessel may be out of service may be longer than anticipated, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company is involved in a joint venture and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships.\nThe Company is involved in a terminal joint venture with SSAT (and through SSAT, other joint ventures at various U.S. West Coast terminals), and may initiate future joint venture projects. A joint venture involves certain risks for the Company such as:\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s lack of voting control over the joint venture, including the risk that the joint venture takes actions resulting in reputational harm to the Company;\n\u25cf Misalignment or inconsistency of interests between the Company and the joint venture partner;\n\u25cf Reliance on the joint venture partner to fund its share of capital or fulfill its other commitments, including the risk that the joint venture partner could become bankrupt; and\n\u25cf Operating difficulties and financial losses at the joint venture, which may lead to the Company writing down assets or incurring impairment charges.\nIn addition, the Company relies on SSAT for its stevedoring services at the ports of Long Beach and Oakland, California and Tacoma, Washington on the U.S. West Coast. The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided, or to the costs of such services provided by SSAT.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in foreign shipping markets.\nMatson\u2019s China, Alaska export, Micronesia, Japan and South Pacific services are subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include:\n\u25cf Challenges associated with operating in foreign countries and developing relationships with foreign companies, business associates and governments, including as a result of cultural differences;\n\u25cf Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including dynamic employment and immigration laws;\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s ability to comply with U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u25cf Not having continued access to existing port facilities or feeder vessels;\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s ability to manage changes in the cost of goods or currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf Political and economic instability; and\n\u25cf Dynamics involving U.S. trade relations with other countries, including the imposition of or uncertainty associated with the level of tariffs or other governmental actions.\nThe Company\u2019s terminals in Hawaii and Alaska require modernization.\nThe Company has completed the first phase of renovating and modernizing its Sand Island terminal in Honolulu Harbor. Significant additional upgrades and projects remain. The Company has also begun discussions with state and local authorities in Anchorage, Alaska regarding upgrades to those terminal and port facilities. Regulatory, construction or other delays or cost overruns related to the expansion and modernization of the terminals could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business plans, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the terminal modernization programs may not result in improved operational productivity or generate expected returns.\nHeightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations and profitability.\nWar, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, Guam or Alaska, thereby adversely affecting those economies and the Company. Additionally, future terrorist attacks could increase volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets. Acts of war or terrorism may be directed at the Company\u2019s shipping operations, or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matson\u2019s vessels for military operation. Heightened security measures, including customs inspections and related procedures in countries of origin and destination, potentially slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways.\nAcquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions, including, for example, the Company\u2019s acquisitions of Horizon Lines, Inc. (\u201cHorizon\u201d) in 2015 and Span Intermediate, LLC (\u201cSpan Alaska\u201d) in 2016. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in identifying, negotiating, or consummating any future acquisitions. Even if suitable candidates are identified, such transactions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired assets or companies, and may result in the diversion of the Company\u2019s capital and its management attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company. The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired.\nRisks Related to Employees\nWork stoppages or other labor disruptions caused by the Company\u2019s unionized workers and other workers or their unions in related industries could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nA significant portion of Matson\u2019s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Furthermore, the Company relies on the services of third-parties, including SSAT, that employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements. For additional information on collective bargaining agreements with unions, see Item 1.C. Employees and Labor Relations of Part I of this Annual Report.\nThe Company has been adversely affected by actions taken by employees of the Company or other companies in related industries against efforts by management of the Company or other companies to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefit increases or modify work practices. Strikes and disruptions have occurred as a result of the failure of Matson or other companies in its industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully.\nIn addition, any slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions, including limits on the availability of labor through trade union hiring halls have had and in the future could have an adverse impact on Matson\u2019s or SSAT\u2019s operations.\nLoss of the Company\u2019s key personnel or failure to adequately manage human capital could adversely affect its business.\nThe Company\u2019s future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel and skilled employees, including its senior management, as well as key personnel at its joint venture partners. The permanent or temporary loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s future operating results because of such employees\u2019 experience and knowledge of the Company\u2019s business and customer relationships. If key employees depart or are unable to work, the Company may incur significant costs to replace them. Additionally, the Company\u2019s ability to execute its business model could be impaired if it cannot replace such personnel in a timely manner. The Company\u2019s investments in and efforts to manage its human capital, including to maintain a desirable workplace culture, may not be successful in identifying, attracting, developing, motivating, retaining, competing for or replacing qualified personnel. The Company does not maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel.\nRisks Related to Information Technology\nIf the Company is not able to use the Company\u2019s information technology and communications systems effectively, the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business might be negatively impacted.\nThe Company is highly dependent on the proper functioning of our information technology systems to enable operations and compete effectively. The Company regularly updates its information technology systems or implements new systems, which could cause substantial business interruption. There is no assurance that the systems upgrades or new systems will meet our current or future business needs, or that they will operate as designed. For example, the Company is in the midst of a multi-year process to implement a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system intended to enhance operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of its business operations.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems also rely on third-party service providers for access to the Internet, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, database storage facilities and telecommunications providers. The Company has no control over the operations of these third-party service providers. In the past, disruptions in the Company\u2019s third-party service providers have impacted the Company\u2019s operations, including the Company\u2019s ability to book and manage freight, stow vessels, and process customs declarations. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in compliance with guidance from public health officials and state and local governments, many of the Company\u2019s employees are working from home or remotely, increasing the Company\u2019s dependence on its information technology systems and third-party providers. If the Company\u2019s information technology and communications systems experience reliability issues, integration or compatibility concerns or if the Company\u2019s third-party providers are unable to perform effectively or experience disruptions or failures, there could be an adverse impact on the availability and functioning of the Company\u2019s information technology and communications systems, which could lead to business disruption or inefficiencies, reputational harm or loss of customers.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems have in the past and may in the future be exposed to cybersecurity risks and other disruptions that could impair the Company\u2019s ability to operate and adversely affect its business.\nThe shipping industry is a more frequent target of cyber attacks than some other industries because of the essential nature of these services. The Company relies extensively on its information technology systems and third-party service providers in many aspects of its business, including cloud services for accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems. The Company also collects, stores and transmits sensitive data, including its proprietary business information and that of its customers, and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees. Despite the Company\u2019s continuous efforts to make investments in the Company\u2019s information technology systems and system-wide data security program, the implementation of security measures to protect the Company\u2019s data and infrastructure against breaches and other cyber threats, and the Company\u2019s use of internal processes and controls designed to protect the security and availability of the Company\u2019s systems, the Company has in the past experienced and may in the future experience cybersecurity risks, such as computer viruses, hacking, malware, denial of service attacks, cyber terrorism, circumvention of security systems, malfeasance, breaches due to employee error, natural disasters, telecommunications failure, or other catastrophic events at the Company\u2019s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations.\nAny failure, breach or unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s systems or those of third-parties on which the Company relies could result in the loss of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information, interruptions in its service or production or otherwise impact the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business operations, and could result in potential reductions in revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability.\nRisks Related to Financial Matters\nThe Company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if recorded intangible assets associated with the Span Alaska acquisition become impaired.\nThe Company recorded significant intangible assets related to goodwill, customer relationships and trade name arising from the Span Alaska acquisition. The Company is required to test goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less\nthan its carrying amount. Factors that could lead to an impairment of goodwill or intangible customer relationships include any significant adverse changes affecting the reporting unit\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and future cash flows.\nA deterioration of the Company\u2019s credit profile, disruptions of the credit markets or higher interest rates could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt.\nDeterioration in the Company\u2019s credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs. If the Company\u2019s credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms. Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facilities to support its operations when required, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation) could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, the Company\u2019s credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Company\u2019s credit profile deteriorates. Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its revolving credit facilities based on floating rates. Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, as was the case in connection with the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increases in 2018, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s cash flow and results of operations. In addition, as the floating rate on certain borrowings under the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility is tied to LIBOR, the uncertainty regarding the future of LIBOR as well as the transition from LIBOR to an alternate benchmark rate or rates could pose funding risks for the Company and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financing costs. Disruptions to the credit markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other macroeconomic or financial market developments could increase the Company\u2019s cost of capital and limit the Company\u2019s access to capital.\nFailure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Company\u2019s credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Company\u2019s business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), a minimum ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, certain prohibitions on additional priority debt, certain prohibitions on sale leaseback transactions, and the maintenance of minimum shareholders\u2019 equity. If the Company does not maintain these and other required covenants, and a breach of such covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders, resulting in a default, the Company\u2019s access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable. The Company\u2019s continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with these financial and other non-financial covenants.\nThe Company\u2019s effective income tax rate may vary.\nVarious internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable material or immaterial effects on the Company\u2019s effective income tax rate and, therefore, impact the Company\u2019s net income and earnings per share. These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations, and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the evaluation of the Company\u2019s ability to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in uncertain tax positions; changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax income as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the level of Capital Construction Fund (\u201cCCF\u201d) deductions, non-deductible expenses, and expenses eligible for tax credits; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with varying tax rates; and acquisitions and changes in the Company\u2019s corporate structure. These factors may result in periodic revisions to the Company\u2019s effective income tax rate, which could affect the Company\u2019s cash flow and results of operations.\nChanges in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe amount of the Company\u2019s employee pension and post-retirement benefit costs and obligations is calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations. Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s single-employer and multi-employer pension plans and plan funding. These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Company\u2019s businesses.\nThe Company may have exposure under its multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Company\u2019s employees.\nThe Company contributes to various multi-employer pension plans. In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report). Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations. If any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member of its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of such plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits. In addition, if any of the multi-employer plans to which the Company contributes fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service will impose certain penalties and taxes on the Company and other contributing employers.\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters\nAs an ocean transportation and logistics services company, the Company is subject to numerous safety, environmental, and other laws and regulations that impact the Company\u2019s operations, are costly to comply with and expose us to liability.\nThe Company, including its vessels and terminals, is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to safety, cabotage, equipment standards and government rates. In addition, the Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations; air emissions; wastewater discharges; the transportation, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, oil and oil-related products, hazardous substances and wastes; the investigation and remediation of contamination; health, safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources; and climate change, including any regulations, mandates or restrictions related to greenhouse gas emissions, such as a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system of allowances and credits, and energy use. For a discussion of specific laws and regulations, see Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report. Any changes in applicable laws and regulations, including their enforcement or interpretation, as well as any new laws and regulations that are adopted, including as a result of the recent change in U.S. Presidential Administration, could impose significant additional costs and limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to operate. Such costs may not be recoverable through increased payments from customers.\nThese laws and regulations require us to obtain certificates of financial responsibility and to adopt procedures for oil and hazardous substance spill prevention, response and clean up, among other requirements impacting the Company\u2019s business. In complying with applicable laws and regulations, the Company has incurred expenses and may incur material future costs and expenses related to vessel and equipment modifications, new equipment, higher-priced fuel, changes in operating practices and procedures, tracking emissions, changing routes, installing scrubbers, adopting or modifying energy sources and undergoing additional oversight inspections, all of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition. For example, Matson\u2019s vessels operate within emissions control areas, and the Company\u2019s U.S. flagged vessels generally must be maintained \u201cin class\u201d and are subject to periodic inspections by the American Bureau of Shipping or similar classification societies. They also must be periodically inspected by, or on behalf of, the United States Coast Guard. The Company\u2019s vessels\u2019 operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during the required annual surveys of the vessels, but there is no assurance that the Company\u2019s programs and policies will be sufficient to have such certificates and licenses renewed. The EPA also requires vessels to obtain coverage under a general permit and to comply with inspection, monitoring, discharge, recordkeeping and reporting requirements.\nThese laws and regulations provide for substantial fines, as well as criminal and civil penalties, in the event of any violations of, or non-compliance with, their requirements (including any waivers, permits or recordkeeping and other reporting requirements). Any vessel-generated pollution from incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles, and in some cases, within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone, for example, could expose us to such fines or penalties.\nThe Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations that could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nThe nature of the Company\u2019s business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC. For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings. If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matson\u2019s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers.\nThe Company may continue to be exposed to risks and unknown liabilities related to the Horizon acquisition.\nThe Company acquired Horizon subject to all of the liabilities and obligations of its non-Hawaii business, including any remaining liabilities and obligations associated with its Puerto Rico operations, which Horizon ceased during the first quarter of 2015. The disposition of these liabilities, and any other obligations that are unknown to the Company, including contingent liabilities, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nPasha acquired Horizon\u2019s former Hawaii business immediately before the Company acquired Horizon, and Pasha assumed substantially all liabilities and obligations related to Horizon\u2019s Hawaii business and agreed to perform various covenants. In some cases, however, Horizon, as the original contracting party, may remain primarily responsible for such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations. The Company may incur losses related to such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations.",

The discussion that follows is intended to provide information that will assist in understanding the changes in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements from year to year, the primary factors that accounted for those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below. Discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Matson for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 can be found in Part II, Item 7 of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020.\nMD&A is presented in the following sections:\n\u25fe Fourth Quarter 2020 Discussion and Update on Business Conditions\n\u25fe Consolidated Results of Operations\n\u25fe Analysis of Operating Revenue and Income by Segment\n\u25fe Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u25fe Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\u25fe Critical Accounting Estimates\n\u25fe Other Matters\nFourth Quarter 2020 Discussion and Update on Business Conditions\nOcean Transportation: The Company\u2019s container volume in the Hawaii service in the fourth quarter 2020 was 0.8 percent higher year-over-year primarily due to an additional westbound sailing and higher demand for sustenance and home improvement goods, partially offset by lower tourism activity as a result of the pandemic. The State of Hawaii eased visitor travel restrictions to the islands in October and saw an improvement in the daily passenger counts, but tourism activity remained significantly below the levels achieved in the prior year period. Tourism levels are expected to remain low until the pandemic subsides and to have a meaningfully negative impact on Hawaii\u2019s economy.\nIn China, the Company\u2019s container volume in the fourth quarter 2020 was 139.1 percent higher year-over-year due to volume from the CLX+ service in addition to higher volume on the CLX service as a result of our increased capacity in the tradelane. Matson continued to realize a rate premium in the fourth quarter 2020 and achieved average freight rates that were higher than in the year ago period. The Company expects elevated consumption of e-commerce and other commodities coupled with other supply and demand factors in the tradelane to largely remain favorable in the first half of 2021 as the pandemic persists. As the pandemic subsides with widespread vaccination, we expect some of the supply and demand factors that we are currently benefitting from to remain and continue to drive demand for our CLX and CLX+ services.\nIn Guam, the Company\u2019s container volume in the fourth quarter 2020 increased 4.2 percent year-over-year primarily due to higher demand for sustenance and home improvement goods, partially offset by lower tourism activity as a result of the pandemic. In the near-term, we expect depressed tourism levels to have a negative impact on the Guam economy.\nIn Alaska, the Company\u2019s container volume for the fourth quarter 2020 increased 18.9 percent year-over-year as a result of higher northbound volume primarily due to two additional sailings and higher demand for sustenance and home improvement goods, and modestly higher southbound volume. The Alaska economy continues to be negatively impacted by the economic effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and a low oil price environment. In the near-term, we expect the economy to slowly recover, but remain challenged until the pandemic subsides.\nThe contribution in the fourth quarter 2020 from the Company\u2019s SSAT joint venture investment was $10.9 million, or $7.9 million higher than the fourth quarter 2019. The increase was driven by higher lift volume.\nLogistics: In the fourth quarter 2020, operating income for the Company\u2019s Logistics segment was $9.6 million, or $2.0 million higher compared to the operating income achieved in the fourth quarter 2019. The increase was due primarily to a higher contribution from transportation brokerage as a result of elevated goods consumption and inventory restocking and tight supply and demand fundamentals in our core markets.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following analysis of the financial results of operations of Matson for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below.\nConsolidated Results: 2020 compared with 2019:\nFiscal Year: Fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 include 52 weeks.\nConsolidated Operating Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $180.2 million, or 8.2 percent, compared to the prior year. The increase was due to an increase in Ocean Transportation revenue of $187.3 million offset by a decrease in Logistics revenue of $7.1 million.\nOperating Costs and Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $29.0 million, or 1.4 percent, compared to the prior year. The increase was due to an increase in Ocean Transportation operating costs and expenses of $33.3 million which was partially offset by a decrease in Logistics operating costs and expenses of $4.3 million.\nOperating Income for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $151.2 million, or 117.1 percent, compared to the prior year. The increase was due to an increase in Ocean Transportation operating income of $154.0 million which was partially offset by an decrease in Logistics operating income of $2.8 million.\nThe reasons for changes in operating revenue, operating costs and expenses, and operating income are described below, by business segment, in the Analysis of Operating Revenue and Income by Segment.\nInterest Expense was $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $22.5 million in the prior year. The increase in interest expense was due to a lower offset amount of capitalized interest associated with new vessel construction, partially offset by a reduction in outstanding debt.\nOther Income (Expense), net was $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.2 million in the prior year, and relates to the amortization of certain components of net periodic benefit costs or gains related to the Company\u2019s pension and post-retirement plans, and interest income received from income tax refunds. The increase in Other income (expense) was due to favorable adjustments reflected in the Company\u2019s pension and post-retirement plan liabilities and higher interest received from income tax refunds during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIncome Taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $65.9 million, or 25.4 percent of income before income taxes, compared to $25.1 million, or 23.3 percent of income before income taxes in the prior year. The 2019 income tax rate benefited from a $2.9 million, or 2.7 percent of non-cash benefit included in income tax expense, resulting from applying the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d).\nNet Income during the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $110.4 million, or 133.5 percent, compared to the prior year.\nANALYSIS OF OPERATING REVENUE AND INCOME BY SEGMENT\nThe following analysis of operating revenue and income by segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s reportable segments information included in Item 6 of Part II and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nOcean Transportation: 2020 compared with 2019:\n(1) Approximate volumes included for the period are based on the voyage departure date, but revenue and operating income are adjusted to reflect the percentage of revenue and operating income earned during the reporting period for voyages in transit at the end of each reporting period.\n(2) Includes containers from services in various islands in Micronesia and the South Pacific, and Okinawa, Japan.\nOcean Transportation revenue increased $187.3 million, or 11.2 percent, during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher freight revenue in the China service, including revenue associated with the CLX+ service, partially offset by lower fuel-related surcharge revenue and lower revenue in Hawaii.\nOn a year-over-year FEU basis, Hawaii container volume decreased 0.6 percent primarily due to lower volume as a result of the pandemic and its effects on tourism, partially offset by volume associated with the dry-docking of one of Pasha\u2019s vessels in the second quarter and higher demand for sustenance and home improvement goods; Alaska volume increased by 4.6 percent primarily due to higher northbound volume, including volume associated with the dry-docking of a competitor\u2019s vessel and one additional sailing, partially offset by modestly lower southbound volume; China volume was 85.8 percent higher primarily due to volume from the CLX+ service in addition to higher volume on the CLX service as a result of our increased capacity in the tradelane; Guam volume was 2.6 percent lower primarily due to lower demand for retail-related goods resulting from the pandemic and its related effects; and Other container volume increased 3.6 percent.\nOcean Transportation operating income increased $154.0 million, or 169.6 percent, during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a higher contribution from the China service, including the contribution from the CLX+ service, and lower vessel operating costs, including the impact of one less vessel operating in the Hawaii service, partially offset by a lower contribution from the Hawaii service.\nThe Company\u2019s SSAT terminal joint venture investment contributed $26.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a contribution of $20.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was largely attributable to lower operating costs.\nLogistics: 2020 compared with 2019:\nLogistics revenue decreased $7.1 million, or 1.3 percent, during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower transportation brokerage and freight forwarding revenue.\nLogistics operating income decreased $2.8 million, or 7.3 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due primarily to a lower contribution from freight forwarding.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSources of liquidity available to the Company at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, were as follows:\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Accounts Receivable: Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts receivable, net, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n(1) Eligible accounts receivable of $1.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were assigned to the CCF.\nChanges in the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n(1) Changes in Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities: Changes in net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nThe change in the amortization of operating lease right of use assets and operating lease liabilities primarily relates to the timing of adopting the lease accounting standard during the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company\u2019s share of income from SSAT was $26.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $20.8 million in the prior year, while distributions from SSAT was $55.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $25.2 million of distributions received in the prior year. Deferred dry-docking payments were $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $25.9 million in the prior year. The decrease in deferred dry-docking payments was due to a reduction in vessel dry-docking activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year. Changes in accounts receivable are primarily due to increased revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year, and also due to the timing of collections as of December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year. Changes in prepaid expenses and other assets are due to the timing of prepaid income taxes, changes in the amount of insurance related receivables and changes in other prepaid amounts as of December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year. Changes in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities are primarily due to increased operating costs during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year, and also due to the timing of payments associated with those liabilities.\n(2) Changes in Net Cash Used in Investing Activities: Changes in net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nCapitalized vessel construction expenditures (including capitalized interest and owners\u2019 items) was $87.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $219.1 million in the prior year. The decrease in capitalized vessel\nconstruction expenditures (including cash deposited into the CCF less cash withdrawals from the CCF which are used for vessel construction related payments) is due to fewer progress payments related to the construction of new vessels during 2020, compared to the prior year. Other capital expenditures (excluding capitalized vessel construction expenditures) was $104.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $91.2 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher levels of capital expenditures related to the installation of scrubbers on vessels and the Hawaii Sand Island terminal expansion and modernization program during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year. Proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment was $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $3.4 million for the prior year. Disposals of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2020 included net proceeds of approximately $14.3 million from the sale and leaseback of container and equipment.\n(3) Changes in Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities: Changes in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received $325.5 million of proceeds from two new Title XI debt issuances, paid $47.1 million in scheduled principal payments, and prepaid $169.5 million of private debt at par, compared to $42.1 million in scheduled principal payments in the prior year. Net repayments of the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility totaled $307.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net borrowings of $144.1 million in the prior year. The decrease in borrowing under the revolving credit facility was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of Title XI debt, and a reduction in vessel construction payments. The Company paid $18.5 million in financing costs related to the Title XI debt issuance during the year ended December 31, 2020. No financing costs were incurred in the prior year.\nDebt: Total debt as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nTotal debt decreased by $198.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. The decrease in the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to increased cash provided by operating activities, a reduction in progress payments related to the construction of new vessels, and proceeds from new Title XI financing that was used to pay down the revolving credit facility. The increase in fixed interest debt was due to the new Title XI financing agreements entered into during 2020 which were partially offset by scheduled debt payments made during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $570.1 million of unused capacity under the revolving credit facility, which matures on June 29, 2022. The leverage ratio under the debt agreements as of December 31, 2020 was approximately 1.7 times. The Company\u2019s debt is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nWorking Capital: The Company had a working capital deficiency of $205.6 million at December 31, 2020, compared to a working capital deficiency of $147.1 million at December 31, 2019. Working capital is impacted by the use of cash to reduce the Company\u2019s long-term revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2020, by the amount and timing of collections associated with accounts receivable and other assets, and by the amount and timing of payments associated with accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities. Working capital deficiency increased as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to the reduction in prepaid expenses and other assets as a result of the collection of income tax and insurance receivables, and an increase in other liabilities due to employee incentives and other accruals.\nCapital Expenditures: In 2021, the Company expects to make the following capital expenditures: (i) maintenance related capital expenditures of approximately $60 - $70 million; (ii) acquisition of equipment to support growth in the CLX+ and AAX services of approximately $55 million; (iii) construction of a new barge of approximately $25 million; and (iv) dry-dock scrubber installation costs of approximately $20 million. Such capital expenditures are expected to be financed through cash provided by operating activities and the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nContractual Obligations:\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had the following estimated contractual obligations:\n(1) Total debt obligations include principal repayments of outstanding debt (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below, for additional information).\n(2) Operating lease obligations primarily consist of real estate and terminal leases, vessel charter leases, operations equipment and other leases entered into under non-cancellable arrangements (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below, for additional information).\n(3) Estimated interest on debt is determined based on: (i) the stated interest rate for fixed debt, and (ii) the estimated variable interest on revolving credit facility assuming the balance at December 31, 2020 remains outstanding until maturity.\n(4) Qualified defined benefit pension, non-qualified pension and post-retirement benefit obligations include estimated payments for the next ten years. The amounts noted in the column labeled \u201cThereafter\u201d represent estimated benefit payments for 2026 through 2030 (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below, for additional information).\n(5) Multi-employer withdrawal obligations relate to the discounted liability associated with Horizon\u2019s mass withdrawal from Puerto Rico\u2019s multi-employer ILA-PRSSA and the partial withdrawal liability associated with the Local 153 Fund of the OPEIU (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below, for additional information).\n(6) Vendor and other obligations include: (i) non-cancellable contractual capital project obligations; (ii) dry-docking related obligations; and (iii) other contractual obligations. Amounts are considered obligations if a contract has been agreed to specifying significant terms of the contract, and the amounts are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nEstimated timing and amount of payments related to unrecognized tax benefits of $18.3 million as of December 31, 2020 are excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of such timing and payments, if any.\nCommitments, Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:\nCommitments and Contingencies: A description of other commitments and contingencies is set forth in Note 9, Note 11 and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below, and is incorporated herein by reference.\nOff-balance sheet Arrangements: Except as described below, the Company is not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFuture minimum payments under operating leases are $302.3 million as of December 31, 2020. In addition, the Company provided a lessor with a maximum residual value guarantee related to the lease of a vessel. Additional information related to leases and the vessel lease guarantee is set forth in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below, and is incorporated herein by reference.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe Company\u2019s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below. The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, upon which the Company\u2019s Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based, requires that management exercise judgment when making accounting estimates about future events that may affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and actual results will, inevitably, differ from those accounting estimates. These differences could be material.\nThe Company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i)(a) the accounting estimate requires the Company to make assumptions that are difficult or subjective about matters that were highly uncertain at the time that the accounting estimate was made, (b) changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur in periods after the period in which the estimate was made, or (c) use of different estimates by the Company could have been used; and (ii) changes in those accounting estimates would have had a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. The critical accounting policies and estimates inherent in the preparation of the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements are described below. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nLong-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill: The Company evaluates its long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. The Company has reporting units within the Ocean Transportation and Logistics reportable segments.\nLong-lived Assets and Finite-lived Intangible Assets: Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets are grouped at the lowest level reporting unit for which identifiable cash flows are available. In evaluating for impairment, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by each of these asset groups are compared with the carrying value recorded for each asset group to determine if its carrying value is recoverable. If this review determines that the amount recorded will not be recovered, the amount recorded for the asset group is reduced to its estimated fair value. These asset impairment analyses are highly subjective because they require management to make assumptions and apply considerable judgments to, among other things, estimates of the timing and amount of future cash flows, expected useful lives of the assets, potential impact of future events, including changes in economic conditions and operating performance, and future costs of maintenance and improvements of the assets. If management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, the Company\u2019s financial condition or its future operating results could be materially impacted. The Company has evaluated its long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment and determined that there was no impairment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nIndefinite-life Intangible Assets and Goodwill: The Company\u2019s intangible assets include goodwill, customer relationships and a trade name, and are grouped at the lowest level reporting unit for which identifiable cash flows are available. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, the Company uses a combination of a discounted cash flow model and fair value based on market multiples of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d). The discounted cash flow approach requires the Company to use a number of assumptions, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a discount rate that considers the risks related to the amount and timing of the cash flows. Although the assumptions used by the Company in its discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions the Company used to generate its internal strategic plans and forecasts, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from the reporting unit and the risk of achieving those cash flows. When using market multiples of EBITDA, the Company makes judgments about the comparability of multiples in closed and proposed transactions. Accordingly, changes in assumptions and estimates, including, but not limited to, changes driven by external factors, such as industry and economic trends, and those driven by internal factors, such as changes in the Company\u2019s business strategy and its internal forecasts, could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or its future operating results. The Company has evaluated its indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill for impairment and determined that there was no impairment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nInsurance Related Liabilities: The Company is uninsured for certain risks but when feasible, many of these risks are mitigated by insurance. The Company purchases insurance with deductibles or self-insured retentions. Such insurance includes, but is not limited to, employee health, workers\u2019 compensation, marine liability, cybersecurity, auto liability and physical damage to property and equipment. For certain risks, the Company elects to not purchase insurance because of the excessive cost of such insurance or the perceived remoteness of the risk. In addition, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of the Company\u2019s insurance policies, or for other risks where insurance is not commercially available.\nWhen estimating its reserves for retained risks and related liabilities, the Company considers a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, current trends, and analyses provided by independent third-parties. Periodically, management reviews its assumptions and estimates used to determine the adequacy of the Company\u2019s reserves for retained risks and other related liabilities. The Company\u2019s retained risks and other related liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to apply judgment and make long-term assumptions to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims, and of claims incurred but not reported, as of the balance sheet date. If management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, the Company\u2019s financial condition or its future operating results could be materially impacted.\nPension and Post-Retirement Plans: The estimation of the Company\u2019s pension and post-retirement benefit expenses and liabilities requires the Company to make various assumptions. These assumptions include factors such as discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, salary growth, health care cost trend rates, inflation, retirement rates, mortality rates and expected contributions. Actual results that differ from the assumptions made could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or its future operating results. The effects of changing assumptions are included in unamortized net gains and losses, which directly affect accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Additionally, these unamortized gains and losses are amortized and reclassified to income (loss) over future periods.\nAdditional information about the Company\u2019s pension and post-retirement plans and assumptions used is included in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below.\nIncome Taxes: The Company\u2019s income tax expense requires the Company to make various estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of taxable income, tax credits, tax benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue, costs and expenses for tax purposes. The calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be impacted by various factors including but not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations, and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings; and changes in the evaluation of the Company\u2019s ability to realize deferred tax assets including operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to the Company\u2019s income taxes in a subsequent period.\nThe Company records a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a recorded deferred tax asset would not be realized in future periods.\nAdditional information about the Company\u2019s income taxes is included in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below.\nOTHER MATTERS\nNew Accounting Pronouncements: See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below for additional information on new accounting pronouncements.",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nDebt and Interest Rate Risks: The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities used to maintain liquidity and to fund business operations, including borrowings under its revolving credit facility and private placement term loans. In order to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates, the Company utilizes a balanced mix of both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt with various maturity dates. The nature and amount of the Company\u2019s outstanding debt are expected to fluctuate as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. The Company\u2019s outstanding variable and fixed rate debt was $71.8 million and $688.3 million as of December 31, 2020, and $379.1 million and $579.3 million as of December 31, 2019, respectively.\nOther than in certain events of default, the Company is not obligated to prepay its variable and fixed rate debt prior to maturity. For fixed rate debt, changes in market interest rates would not affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. For variable rate debt, a 100 basis point increase in the variable interest rate would have an impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations for 2020 of approximately $0.7 million, assuming the December 31, 2020 balance of the variable rate debt was outstanding throughout the year. This change is not expected to have a material impact on the fair value of the Company\u2019s variable rate debt.\nInterest on certain borrowings by the Company is calculated using the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). Current expectations are that the use of LIBOR will be discontinued as a benchmark interest rate by mid-2023. The expected discontinuation of LIBOR will require the Company and its lenders to transition from a LIBOR measurement to an alternative benchmark interest rate. The transition from LIBOR to another benchmark rate or rates could have an adverse impact on the cost of certain borrowings by the Company that currently use LIBOR as a benchmark rate, and ultimately, adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditional information about the Company\u2019s debt is included in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in",

Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company\u2019s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company\u2019s Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u25cf Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the company;\n\u25cf Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n\u25cf Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting only provides reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement presentation and preparation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is effective. The Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\n/s/ Matthew J. Cox\n/s/ Joel M. Wine\nMatthew J. Cox\nJoel M. Wine\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nFebruary 26, 2021\nFebruary 26, 2021\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Matson, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Matson, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). We also have audited the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoodwill - Span Alaska Reporting Unit - Refer to Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company\u2019s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, the Company uses a combination of a discounted cash flow model and fair value based on market multiples of EBITDA. The discounted cash flow approach requires the Company to make several business assumptions related to discount rates and forecasts of future revenues. Changes in assumptions and estimates, including, but not limited to, changes driven by external factors, such as industry and economic trends, and those driven by internal factors, such as changes in the Company\u2019s business strategy and its internal forecasts, could have a material effect on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The goodwill balance was $327.8 million as of December 31, 2020, of which $78.6 million is allocated to a reporting unit in the Logistics reportable segment, resulting from the acquisition of Span Intermediate, LLC (\u201cSpan Alaska\u201d) in fiscal year 2016. The Company has evaluated its goodwill for impairment as part of its annual assessment in fiscal year 2020 and determined that the fair value of the Span Alaska reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount as of the date of the impairment review.\nWe identified goodwill related to Span Alaska as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management made to estimate the fair value of Span Alaska. Specifically, due to the sensitivity of Span Alaska\u2019s operations to changes in the Alaskan economy, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues and selection of the discount rate, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the forecasts of future revenue, specifically as they relate to Span Alaska, and the selection of the discount rate for Span Alaska included the following, among others:\n\u25cf We tested the effectiveness of controls over management\u2019s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the forecasts of future revenue and the selection of the discount rate.\n\u25cf We evaluated management\u2019s ability to accurately forecast future revenue by comparing actual results to management\u2019s historical forecasts.\n\u25cf We evaluated the reasonableness of management\u2019s revenue forecast by comparing the forecasts to (1) historical revenues and operating margins, (2) internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, (3) external communications made by management to analysts and investors, (4) trends in the logistics industry and (5) trends in the Alaskan economy.\n\u25cf With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rate, including testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate, testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 26, 2021\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since at least 1976; however, an earlier year could not be reliably determined.\nMATSON, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\nMatson, Inc., a holding company incorporated in the State of Hawaii, and its subsidiaries (\u201cMatson\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), is a leading provider of ocean transportation and logistics services. The Company consists of two segments, Ocean Transportation and Logistics. For financial information on the Company\u2019s reportable segments for the three years ended December 31, 2020, see Note 3.\nOcean Transportation: Matson\u2019s Ocean Transportation business is conducted through Matson Navigation Company, Inc. (\u201cMatNav\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Matson, Inc. Founded in 1882, MatNav provides a vital lifeline of ocean freight transportation services to the domestic non-contiguous economies of Hawaii, Alaska and Guam, and to other island economies in Micronesia. MatNav also operates two premium, expedited services from China to Long Beach, California, and provides services to Okinawa, Japan and various islands in the South Pacific, and operates an international export service from Dutch Harbor to Asia. In addition, subsidiaries of MatNav provide stevedoring, refrigerated cargo services, inland transportation and other terminal services for MatNav and other ocean carriers on the Hawaiian islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui and Kauai, and in the Alaska locations of Anchorage, Kodiak and Dutch Harbor.\nMatson has a 35 percent ownership interest in SSA Terminals, LLC, a joint venture between Matson Ventures, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MatNav, and SSA Ventures, Inc., a subsidiary of Carrix, Inc. (\u201cSSAT\u201d). SSAT currently provides terminal and stevedoring services to various carriers at seven terminal facilities on the U.S. West Coast, including three facilities dedicated for MatNav\u2019s use. Matson records its share of income from SSAT in costs and expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, and within the Ocean Transportation segment due to the nature of SSAT\u2019s operations.\nLogistics: Matson\u2019s Logistics business is conducted through Matson Logistics, Inc. (\u201cMatson Logistics\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MatNav. Established in 1987, Matson Logistics is an asset-light business that provides a variety of logistics services to its customers including: (i) multimodal transportation brokerage of domestic and international rail intermodal services, long-haul and regional highway trucking services, specialized hauling, flat-bed and project services, less-than-truckload services, and expedited freight services (collectively, \u201cTransportation Brokerage\u201d services); (ii) less-than-container load (\u201cLCL\u201d) consolidation and freight forwarding services (collectively, \u201cFreight Forwarding\u201d services); (iii) warehousing and distribution services; and (iv) supply chain management, non-vessel operating common carrier (\u201cNVOCC\u201d) freight forwarding and other services.\n2.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation: The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Matson, Inc. and all wholly-owned subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany amounts and transactions. Significant investments in businesses, partnerships, and limited liability companies in which the Company does not have a controlling financial interest, but has the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method. The Company accounts for its investment in SSAT using the equity method of accounting (see Note 4).\nFiscal Year: The year end for Matson is December 31. The period end for MatNav occurred on the last Friday in December, except for Matson Logistics Warehousing, Inc. and Matson South Pacific Holdco Limited whose period closed on December 31. Included in these Consolidated Financial Statements are 52 weeks in the 2020, 2019 and 2018 fiscal years for MatNav.\nForeign Currency Transactions: The United States (U.S.) dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the financial statements of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates. Translation adjustments resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (gain) within shareholders\u2019 equity. The Company translates the result of operations of its foreign subsidiaries at the average exchange rate during the respective periods. Gains and losses\nresulting from foreign currency transactions are included in Costs and Expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nUse of Estimates: The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates and assumptions are used for, but not limited to: impairment of investments; impairment of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill; capitalized interest; allowance for doubtful accounts; legal contingencies; insurance reserves and other related liabilities; accrual estimates; pension and post-retirement estimates; multi-employer withdrawal liabilities; operating lease assets and liabilities; and income taxes. Future results could be materially affected if actual results differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash: Cash equivalents consist of highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company carries these investments at cost, which approximates fair value. Outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit totaled $19.9 million and $13.8 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restricted cash relates to amounts that are subject to contractual restrictions and are not readily available. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, restricted cash was $5.3 million and $7.2 million, respectively, and are included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAccounts Receivable, net: Accounts receivable represent amounts due from trade customers arising in the normal course of business. Accounts receivable are shown net of allowance for doubtful accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is established by management based on estimates of collectability. Estimates of collectability are principally based on an evaluation of the current financial condition of the customer and the potential risks to collection, the customer\u2019s payment history, expected future credit losses and other factors which are regularly monitored by the Company.\nChanges in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n(1) Expense is shown net of amounts recovered from previously reserved doubtful accounts.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Assets: Prepaid expenses and other assets consist of the following at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nDeferred Loan Fees: The Company records deferred loan fees, excluding those related to the revolving credit facility, as a reduction to Total Debt in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (\u201cASU 2015-03\u201d). These costs are being amortized over the life of the related debt using the effective interest method (see Note 8).\nDeferred loan fees related to the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility are recorded in other long-term assets in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are amortized using the straight-line method as the difference between that and the use of the effective interest method is not material.\nOther Long-Term Assets: Other long-term assets consist of the following at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nProperty and Equipment: Property and equipment is stated at cost. Property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment range up to the following maximum life:\nCapitalized Interest: The Company capitalizes interest costs during the period the qualified assets are being readied for their intended use. The Company determined that the vessel construction costs are considered qualifying assets for the purposes of capitalizing interest on these assets. The amount of capitalized interest is calculated based on the amount of payments incurred related to the construction of these vessels using a weighted average interest rate. The weighted average interest rate is determined using the Company\u2019s average borrowings outstanding during the period. Capitalized interest is included in vessel construction in progress in property and equipment in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 5). During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company capitalized $7.4 million, $15.6 million and $18.7 million of interest related to the construction of new vessels, respectively.\nLeases: The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 842, Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d) on January 1, 2019. ASC 842 requires lessees to record leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses in their income statements in a manner similar to pre-adoption practice. ASC 842 states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments, and a right-of-use asset for the underlying leased asset for the period of the lease term. Refer to Note 9 for additional information on the Company\u2019s lease related disclosures.\nDeferred Dry-docking Costs: U.S. flagged vessels must meet specified seaworthiness standards established by U.S. Coast Guard rules and classification society rules. These standards require U.S. flagged vessels to undergo two dry-docking inspections within a five-year period, with a maximum of 36 months between them. However, U.S. flagged vessels that are enrolled in the U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s Underwater Survey in Lieu of Dry-docking (\u201cUWILD\u201d) program are allowed to have their Intermediate Survey dry-docking requirement met with a less costly underwater inspection. Non-U.S. flagged vessels are required to meet applicable classification society rules and their own local standards for seaworthiness, which also mandate vessels to undergo two dry-docking inspections every five years.\nThe Company is responsible for maintaining its vessels in compliance with U.S. and international standards. As costs associated with dry-docking inspections provide future economic benefits to the Company through continued operation of the vessels, the costs are deferred and amortized until the scheduled date of the next required dry-docking, which is usually over a two to five-year period. Amortization of deferred dry-docking costs are charged to operating expenses of the Ocean Transportation segment in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Routine vessel maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets: Goodwill and intangible assets arise as a result of acquisitions made by the Company (see Note 6). Intangible assets consist of customer relationships which are being amortized using the straight-line method over the expected useful lives ranging up to 21 years, and a trade name that has an indefinite life.\nImpairment Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill: The Company evaluates its long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. The Company has reporting units within the Ocean Transportation and Logistics reportable segments.\nLong-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets are grouped at the lowest level reporting unit for which identifiable cash flows are available. In evaluating for impairment, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by each of these asset groups are compared with the carrying value recorded for each asset group to determine if its carrying value is recoverable. If this review determines that the amount recorded will not be recovered, the amount recorded for the asset group is reduced to its estimated fair value. No impairment charges of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nIndefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill are grouped at the lowest level reporting unit for which identifiable cash flows are available. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, the Company uses a combination of a discounted cash flow model and fair value based on market multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Based upon the Company\u2019s evaluation of its indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill for impairment, the Company determined that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds book value. No impairment charges of indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nImpairment Evaluation of SSAT: The Company\u2019s investment in SSAT, a related party, is evaluated for impairment whenever there is evidence of impairment during the reporting period. If any impairment is identified, the Company evaluates if the decrease in the fair value of the investment below its carrying value is other-than-temporary. No impairment was identified during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nOther Liabilities: Other liabilities consist of the following at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nOther Long-Term Liabilities: Other long-term liabilities consist of the following at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nPension and Post-Retirement Plans: The Company is a member of the Pacific Maritime Association (\u201cPMA\u201d) and the Hawaii Stevedoring Industry Committee, which negotiate multi-employer pension plans covering certain shoreside bargaining unit personnel. The Company directly negotiates multi-employer pension plans covering other bargaining unit personnel. Pension costs are accrued in accordance with contribution rates established by the PMA, the parties to a plan or the trustees of a plan. Several trusteed, non-contributory, single-employer defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans cover substantially all other employees.\nThe estimation of the Company\u2019s pension and post-retirement benefit expenses and liabilities requires that the Company make various assumptions. These assumptions include factors such as discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on pension plan assets, salary growth, health care cost trend rates, inflation, retirement rates, mortality rates, and expected contributions. Actual results that differ from the assumptions made could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or its future operating results. Additional information about the Company\u2019s pension and post-retirement plans is included in Note 11.\nInsurance Related Liabilities: The Company is uninsured for certain risks but when feasible, many of these risks are mitigated by insurance. The Company purchases insurance with deductibles or self-insured retentions. Such insurance includes, but is not limited to, employee health, workers\u2019 compensation, marine liability, cybersecurity, auto liability and physical damage to property and equipment. For certain risks, the Company elects to not purchase insurance because of the excessive cost of insurance or the perceived remoteness of the risk. In addition, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of the Company\u2019s insurance policies, or for other risks where insurance is not commercially available.\nWhen estimating its reserves for retained risks and related liabilities, the Company considers a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, current trends, and analyses provided by independent third-parties. Periodically, management reviews its assumptions and estimates used to determine the adequacy of the Company\u2019s reserves for retained risks and other related liabilities.\nRecognition of Revenues and Expenses: Revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements is presented net of elimination of intercompany transactions. The following is a description of the Company\u2019s principal revenue generating activities by segment, and the Company\u2019s revenue recognition policy for each activity for the periods presented:\n(1) Ocean Transportation revenue transactions are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars except for less than 3 percent of Ocean Transportation services revenue and fuel sales revenue categories which are denominated in foreign currencies.\n\u25fe Ocean Transportation services revenue is recognized ratably over the duration of a voyage based on the relative transit time completed in each reporting period. Vessel operating costs and other ocean transportation operating costs, such as terminal operating overhead and selling, general and administrative expenses, are charged to operating costs as incurred.\n\u25fe Terminal and other related services revenue is recognized as the services are performed. Related costs are recognized as incurred.\n\u25fe Fuel sales revenue and related costs are recognized when the Company has completed delivery of the product to the customer in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.\n\u25fe Vessel management and related services revenue is recognized in proportion to the services completed. Related costs are recognized as incurred.\n(1) Logistics revenue transactions are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars except for approximately 3 percent of transportation brokerage and freight forwarding services revenue, and supply chain management and other services revenue categories which are denominated in foreign currencies.\n(2) The Company has reclassified $15.8 million and $16.6 million from transportation brokerage and freight forwarding services to warehouse and distribution services, and supply chain management and other services for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, to be consistent with its current period presentation. There was no change in total Logistics revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\u25fe Transportation Brokerage and Freight Forwarding services revenue consists of amounts billed to customers for services provided. The primary costs include third-party purchased transportation services, agent commissions, labor and equipment. Revenue and the related purchased third-party transportation costs are recognized over the duration of a delivery based upon the relative transit time completed in each reporting period. Labor, agent commissions, and other operating costs are expensed as incurred. The Company reports revenue on a gross basis as the Company serves as the principal in these transactions because it is responsible for fulfilling the contractual arrangements with the customer and has latitude in establishing prices.\n\u25fe Warehousing and distribution services revenue consist of amounts billed to customers for storage, handling, and value-added packaging of customer merchandise. Storage revenue is recognized in the month the service is provided to the customer. Storage related costs are recognized as incurred. Other warehousing and distribution services revenue and related costs are recognized in proportion to the services performed.\n\u25fe Supply chain management and other services revenue, and related costs are recognized in proportion to the services performed.\nThe Company generally invoices its customers at the commencement of the voyage or the transportation service being provided, or as other services are being performed. Revenue is deferred when services are invoiced in advance to the customer. The Company\u2019s receivables are classified as short-term as collection terms are for periods of less than one year. The Company expenses sales commissions and contract acquisition costs as incurred because the amounts are generally immaterial. These expenses are included in selling, general and administration expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nCustomer Concentration: The Ocean Transportation segment serves customers in numerous industries and carries a wide variety of cargo, mitigating its dependence upon any single customer or single type of cargo. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the 10 largest Ocean Transportation customers accounted for approximately 22 percent, 23 percent and 24 percent of Ocean Transportation revenue, respectively. None of these customers individually account for more than 10 percent of Ocean Transportation operating revenues.\nThe Logistics segment serves customers in numerous industries and geographical locations. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the 10 largest Logistics customers accounted for approximately 19 percent, 21 percent and 23 percent of Logistics revenue, respectively. None of these customers individually account for more than 10 percent of Logistics operating revenues.\nDividends: The Company recognizes dividends as a liability when approved by the Board of Directors.\nShare-Based Compensation: The Company records compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors. The Company\u2019s various stock-based compensation plans are more fully described in Note 15.\nIncome Taxes: The estimate of the Company\u2019s income tax expense requires the Company to make various estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of taxable income, tax credits, tax benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue, costs and expenses for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse.\nThe Company records a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a recorded deferred tax asset would not be realized in future periods. The Company\u2019s income taxes are more fully described in Note 10.\nRounding: Amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are rounded to millions, except for per share calculations and percentages which were determined based on amounts before rounding. Accordingly, a recalculation of some per-share amounts and percentages, if based on the reported data, may be slightly different.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements:\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d): In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU 2016-13 which amends the current approach to estimate credit losses on certain financial assets, including trade and other receivables, available-for-sale securities and other financial instruments. ASU 2016-13 requires entities to establish a valuation allowance for the expected lifetime losses of certain financial instruments. Subsequent changes in the valuation allowance are recorded in current earnings and reversal of previous losses is permitted. The new standard was effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2019.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective approach. Upon adoption, the Company included an evaluation of expected future credit losses as part of its estimate for determining the allowance for doubtful accounts. The impact of this change was not material to the Company\u2019s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCustomer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract (\u201cASU 2018-15\u201d): In August 2018, FASB issued ASU 2018-15 which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The Company adopted ASU 2018-15 on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company capitalized costs of $2.4 million related to cloud computing arrangements and which were included in other long-term assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020.\n3.REPORTABLE SEGMENTS\nReportable segments are components of an enterprise that engage in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. The Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer.\nThe Company consists of two reportable segments, Ocean Transportation and Logistics, which are further described in Note 1. Reportable segments are measured based on operating income. In arrangements where the customer purchases ocean transportation and logistics services, the revenues are allocated to each reportable segment based upon the contractual amounts for each type of service. The Company\u2019s SSAT segment has been aggregated into the Company\u2019s Ocean Transportation segment due to the operations of SSAT being an integral part of the Company\u2019s Ocean Transportation business (see Note 4).\nThe Company\u2019s Ocean Transportation segment provides ocean transportation services to the Logistics segment, and the Logistics segment provides logistics services to the Ocean Transportation segment in certain transactions. Accordingly, inter-segment revenue of $115.5 million, $102.3 million and $95.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, have been eliminated from operating revenues in the table below.\nReportable segment financial information for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, and identifiable asset segment information at December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:\n(1) Ocean Transportation operating revenue excludes inter-segment revenue of $59.1 million, $52.8 million and $51.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(2) Logistics operating revenue excludes inter-segment revenue of $56.4 million, $49.5 million and $43.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(3) Ocean Transportation segment information includes $26.3 million, $20.8 million, and $36.8 million of equity in income from the Company\u2019s equity investment in SSAT for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(1) The Ocean Transportation segment includes $48.7 million and $76.2 million related to the Company\u2019s equity investment in SSAT as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n4.\nINVESTMENT IN SSAT\nThe Company accounts for its 35 percent ownership interest in SSAT using the equity method of accounting. The Company records its share of income from SSAT in costs and expenses within the Ocean Transportation segment due to operations of SSAT being an integral part of the Company\u2019s Ocean Transportation business. The Company\u2019s investment in SSAT was $48.7 million and $76.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an increase of $2.2 million in its investment in SSAT and a corresponding increase in retained earnings related to the formation of a new subsidiary of SSAT, whose controlling interest is retained by SSAT.\nThe Company\u2019s share of income recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income and dividends received by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\nThe Company\u2019s Ocean Transportation segment operating costs include $251.6 million, $218.7 million and $213.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for terminal services provided by SSAT. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include $29.8 million and $63.6 million for terminal services payable to SSAT at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nA summary of the condensed balance sheets of SSAT at December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nA summary of the condensed statements of operating income and net income of SSAT for years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\n(1)\nIncludes earnings from equity method investments held by SSAT less earnings allocated to non-controlling interests.\n5.\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:\n6.\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill by segment as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 consists of the following:\nLogistics goodwill of $105.2 million includes $78.6 million acquired as part of the acquisition of Span Intermediate, LLC (\u201cSpan Alaska\u201d) in August 2016 that was allocated to the Span Alaska reporting unit, and $26.6 million relates to other Logistics acquisitions that were allocated to the Logistics reporting unit.\nIntangible assets by segment as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 consist of the following:\nOcean Transportation intangible assets of $140.6 million relate to customer relationships acquired as part of the acquisition of Horizon Lines, Inc. (\u201cHorizon\u201d) on May 29, 2015, and are being amortized over 21 years. Logistics intangible assets include $79.3 million of customer relationships which are being amortized over 20 years, and\n$27.3 million of an indefinite life trade name, both acquired as part of the Span Alaska acquisition. The remaining Logistics customer relationships of $10.8 million are being amortized over a period of up to 13 years.\nIntangible assets related amortization expense for 2020, 2019 and 2018, is as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020, estimated amortization expense related to customer relationship intangible assets during the next five years and thereafter is as follows:\n7.\nCAPITAL CONSTRUCTION FUND\nThe Company is party to an agreement with the U.S. Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (\u201cMARAD\u201d) that established a Capital Construction Fund (\u201cCCF\u201d) program under provisions of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended (the \u201cMerchant Marine Act\u201d). The CCF program was created to assist owners and operators of U.S. flagged vessels in raising capital necessary for the modernization and expansion of the U.S. merchant marine fleet. CCF funds may be used for the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of vessels, and for repayment of existing vessel indebtedness through the deferment of federal income taxes on certain deposits of monies and other property placed into the CCF. Qualified withdrawals from the CCF must be used for investment in vessels built in the U.S. and used between covered U.S. ports as described by the Merchant Marine Act, and for other qualifying expenditures (see Item 1 of Part 1 for additional information on Maritime Laws and the Jones Act). Participants of the CCF must also meet certain U.S. citizenship requirements.\nDeposits into the CCF are limited by certain applicable earnings and other conditions. Such deposits, once made, are available as tax deductions in the Company\u2019s income tax provision. Qualified withdrawals from the CCF do not give rise to a current income tax liability, but reduce the depreciable basis of the vessels or certain related equipment for income tax purposes. However, if withdrawals are made from the CCF for general corporate purposes or other non-qualified purposes, or upon termination of the agreement, they are taxable with interest payable from the year of deposit.\nDeposits not committed for qualified purposes within 25 years from the date of deposit will be treated as non-qualified withdrawals over the subsequent five years. Under the terms of the CCF agreement, the Company may designate certain qualified earnings as \u201caccrued deposits\u201d or may designate, as obligations of the CCF, qualified withdrawals to reimburse qualified expenditures initially made with operating funds. Such accrued deposits to, and withdrawals from, the CCF are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets either as obligations of the Company\u2019s current assets or as receivables from the CCF.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $1.7 million of eligible accounts receivable were assigned to the CCF. Due to the nature of the assignment of eligible accounts receivable into the CCF, such assigned amounts are classified as part of accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amounts on deposit in the CCF invested in a money market fund, which is classified as other long-term assets in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets, were nominal.\n8.\nDEBT\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company\u2019s debt consisted of the following:\nThe following is a description of the Company\u2019s debt:\nPrivate Placement Term Loans: The 5.79 percent notes payable through 2020 are amortized by semi-annual principal payments of $3.5 million plus interest.

Inouye and Kaimana Hila (the \u201cVessels\u201d).\nRevolving Credit Facility: On June 29, 2017, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that provides the Company with additional sources of liquidity for working capital, capital expenditures and investment opportunities, and amends and restates the Company\u2019s previously amended and restated credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d or the \u201crevolving credit facility\u201d). The Credit Agreement expires on June 29, 2022, and provides for committed aggregate borrowing of up to $650 million, with an uncommitted option to increase the aggregate borrowing by up to $250 million. The aggregate borrowing within the Credit Agreement includes a $100 million sublimit for the issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit, and a $50 million sublimit for swing line loans. The Company may prepay any amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement without premium or penalty. All obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by MatNav and certain other subsidiaries.\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company entered into a First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement Amendment\u201d). The Credit Agreement Amendment provides for amendments to certain covenants and other terms, including increasing the permitted consolidated leverage ratio from March 31, 2020 to December 30, 2021, amending the pricing grid to provide for pricing ranging from, at the Company\u2019s election, LIBOR plus a margin between 1.75 percent and 3.50 percent, or a base rate plus a margin between 0.75 percent and 2.50 percent depending on the Company\u2019s consolidated net leverage ratio; providing for additional limitations on stock redemptions and repurchases, sale leaseback transactions and asset sales during the period from March 31, 2020 through December 30, 2021; and providing for additional limitations on the incurrence of priority debt through December 21, 2027. In addition, the Credit Agreement Amendment adds a \u201cmost favored lender\u201d provision for the benefit of the lenders with respect to the Company\u2019s Private Debt Agreements (as defined below). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement Amendment, commencing March 31, 2020, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either LIBOR plus a margin of between 1.75 percent and 3.50 percent or the base rate plus a margin of between 0.75 percent and 2.50 percent.

The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2020.\nDebt Covenants in Existing Title XI Bonds and 2020 Title XI Debt Agreements: The Existing Title XI Bonds contain customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants, defaults and other provisions typical for MARAD-guaranteed financings of this type, with definitions and limitations as defined within the Existing Title XI Bonds. These covenants include, among other things, minimum working capital and net worth requirements, limitations on certain other indebtedness, loans and investments, liens, mergers, asset sales, sale and leaseback transactions, and transactions with affiliates as defined within the Existing Title XI Bonds. Certain of the covenants in the Existing Title XI Bonds are applicable only upon and during the continuance of either (i) an event of default or (ii) the failure of MatNav to meet certain financial requirements.\nThe 2020 Title XI Debt agreements contain customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants, defaults and other provisions typical for MARAD-guaranteed financings of this type, with definitions, limitations and financial tests all as negotiated between MatNav and MARAD. As part of the 2020 Title XI Debt agreements, certain covenants contained in the Existing Title XI Bonds were eliminated. The covenants in the 2020 Title XI Debt agreements include, among other things, limitations on certain other indebtedness, loans and investments, liens, mergers, asset sales, sale-leasebacks, and transactions with affiliates as defined within the 2020 Title XI Debt agreements. Certain of the covenants in the 2020 Title XI Debt agreements are applicable only upon and during the continuance of either (i) an event of default or (ii) the failure of either the Company or MatNav to meet certain supplemental financial tests.\n\u25cf The supplemental financial tests applicable to MatNav include maintenance of a working capital minimum of $1, and maintenance of a long term debt to net worth ratio of greater than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0; and\n\u25cf The supplemental financial tests applicable to the Company include maintenance of a net worth greater than or equal to 90% of the net worth of the Company as set forth in the most recent audited financial statements prior to closing of the issuance of the 2020 Title XI Bonds and compliance with the leverage ratio set forth in the Company\u2019s Credit Agreement.\nDebt Security and Guarantees: All of the debt of the Company and MatNav, including related guarantees, as of December 31, 2020 was unsecured, except for the Existing Title XI Bonds and the 2020 Title XI Debt.\nUnder the 2020 Title XI Debt agreements, MARAD has guaranteed certain obligations of MatNav. MatNav has agreed to reimburse MARAD for any payments it makes under the MARAD guaranty, and MatNav\u2019s obligations to MARAD with respect to the 2020 Title XI Debt are secured by a mortgage on the Vessels and certain other related assets (the \u201cCollateral\u201d), as well as the Existing Vessels (as defined below). In addition, MatNav\u2019s obligations to MARAD with respect to the 2020 Title XI Debt are guaranteed by the Company under an Affiliate Guaranty (the \u201cGuaranty\u201d).\nThe 2020 Title XI Debt agreements also provide that the two vessels securing MatNav\u2019s Existing Title XI Bonds - Manukai and Maunawili (the \u201cExisting Vessels\u201d) - also secure the 2020 Title XI Bonds until the Existing Title XI Debt are retired in 2028 and 2029, respectively, subject to certain exceptions.\n9.\nLEASES\nThe Company adopted the lease accounting standard ASC 842 on January 1, 2019. As part of the adoption, the Company recorded a net adjustment to retained earnings of $4.4 million at January 1, 2019. Significant assumptions and judgments made in applying the new lease accounting standard include determining the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate and evaluating the probability of exercising lease options.\nDescription of Operating Leases: The Company has different types of operating leases, the specific terms and conditions of which vary from lease to lease. Certain operating lease agreements include terms such as: (i) renewal and early termination options; (ii) early buy-out and purchase options; and (iii) rent escalation clauses. The lease agreements also include provisions for the maintenance of the leased asset and payment of lease related costs. The Company reviews the specific terms and conditions of each lease and, as appropriate, notifies the lessor of any intent to exercise any option in accordance with the terms of the lease. In the normal course of business, the Company expects to be able to renew or replace most of its operating leases with other similar leases as they expire. Except for the residual value guarantee described below, the Company\u2019s leases do not contain any other residual value guarantees.\nThe Company\u2019s sub-lease income was nominal to the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company did not have any finance leases during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Certain of the Company\u2019s lease agreements include rental payments that may be adjusted in the future based on economic conditions and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Variable lease expense is disclosed for the adjusted portion of such payments.\nThe lease type by underlying asset class and maximum terms of the Company\u2019s operating leases are as follows:\nIncremental Borrowing Rate: As most of the Company\u2019s operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an estimated incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the date of adoption and subsequent lease commencement dates in calculating the present value of its operating lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using the U.S. Treasury rate adjusted to account for the Company\u2019s credit rating and the collateralized nature of operating leases.\nComponents of Lease Cost: Components of lease cost recorded in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following:\nOther Lease Information: Other information related to the Company\u2019s operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities at December 31, 2020 are as follows:\nSale and Leaseback of Equipment: On March 25, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement for the sale and leaseback of multiple tranches of chassis and container equipment. The net proceeds from the sales were $14.3 million, and the gain on the disposal of the equipment was not material to the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company subsequently leased back the equipment under a five-year operating lease agreement, and the obligations under the lease are included in the maturities of operating lease liabilities table above.\nVessel Charter and Buyer-Lessor Guaranty\nVessel Charter: On November 26, 2018, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into agreements whereby a vessel, Maunalei, owned by the subsidiary, was sold for $106.0 million and subsequently leased back from the buyer-lessor under a Bareboat Charter Agreement (the \u201cCharter\u201d). The transaction qualified for sale and leaseback treatment under ASC 840, Leases, with the Charter treated as an operating lease for accounting purposes. Lease payments are approximately $3.0 million per quarter, and the base term of the Charter is five years with a two year end-of-term renewal option. Total future minimum lease payments were $36.0 million at December 31, 2020, and the obligations under the lease are included in the maturities of operating lease liabilities table above.\nPrior to the expiration of the base term of the Charter, the subsidiary may, at its option, elect to: (i) purchase the vessel at the option price; (ii) exercise the option to renew the Charter for an additional two years; or (iii) remarket the vessel to sell to a third-party on behalf of the buyer-lessor. The purchase option price is $68.9 million after the base term and $58.3 million after the extended term. The Charter also includes a maximum residual value guarantee amount of $50.9 million after five years, or $47.7 million after the extended term. Proceeds from the sale of the vessel reduces the subsidiary\u2019s residual value guarantee.\nBuyer-Lessor Guaranty: Matson, Inc. provided the buyer-lessor with a guaranty of all obligations of the wholly-owned subsidiary related to the Charter as defined in the guaranty agreement.\n10.\nINCOME TAXES\nIncome Taxes: On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d) was signed into law and included numerous changes to existing tax law, including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. The rate reduction and other changes took effect on January 1, 2018. Other changes such as remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities were effective as of the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIncome taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following:\n(1) Current income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 include a non-cash income tax benefit of $2.9 million and a non-cash income tax expense of $2.9 million, respectively, which relates to discrete adjustments as a result of applying the provisions of the Tax Act.\nIncome taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 differ from amounts computed by applying the statutory federal rate to income before income taxes for the following reasons:\n(1) Effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 includes the impact of a non-cash income tax benefit of $2.9 million, or 2.7 percent, and a non-cash income tax expense of $2.9 million, or 2.0 percent, respectively, which related to certain discrete adjustments as a result of applying the provisions of the Tax Act.\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows:\nValuation Allowance: Valuation allowances recorded against the Company\u2019s foreign income tax net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and a portion of the state income tax NOLs were $10.0 million and $10.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from these amounts will not be realized. The Company recorded a decrease (increase) to its valuation allowance of $0.6 million, $0.9 million and ($1.1) million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNet Operating Losses and Tax Credit Carryforwards: The Company\u2019s NOLs and tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n(1) The Company does not expect to benefit from $157.9 million and $157.9 million of U.S. State income tax NOLs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe U.S. federal and state income tax NOLs in the Company\u2019s filed income tax returns include unrecognized tax benefits. The deferred tax assets recognized for those NOLs are presented net of these unrecognized tax benefits. As a result of changes in tax legislation, the use of a portion of the Company\u2019s domestic NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be limited in future periods. Further, a portion of the federal and state income tax NOLs and tax credit carryforwards may expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits: Total unrecognized benefits represent the amount that, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company\u2019s incomes taxes and effective tax rate in future periods. The Company does not expect a material\nchange in gross unrecognized benefits in the next twelve months. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2020 are potential benefits of $18.3 million that, if recognized, would affect the Company\u2019s income taxes and effective tax rate. The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes. To the extent interest and penalties are not ultimately assessed with respect to the settlement of uncertain tax positions, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the Company\u2019s income taxes. Interest accrued related to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits totaled $0.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax audits for years before 2015. The Company is routinely involved in federal, state, local income and excise tax audits, and foreign tax audits.\n11.\nPENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT PLANS\nNon-bargaining Plans:\nThe Company has two funded qualified single-employer defined benefit pension plans that cover certain non-bargaining unit employees and bargaining unit employees. In addition, the Company has plans that provide certain retiree health care and life insurance benefits to substantially all salaried, non-bargaining employees hired before 2008 and to certain bargaining unit employees. Employees are generally eligible for such benefits upon retirement and completion of a specified number of years of service. The Company does not pre-fund these health care and life insurance benefits, and has the right to modify or terminate certain of these plans in the future. Most non-bargaining retirees pay a portion of the benefit costs.\nPlan Administration, Investments and Asset Allocations: The Company has a Benefits Investment Committee that meets regularly with investment advisors to establish investment policies, direct investments and select investment options for the qualified plans. The Benefits Investment Committee is also responsible for appointing investment managers and monitoring their performance. The Company\u2019s investment policy permits investments in marketable equity securities, such as domestic and foreign stocks, domestic and foreign bonds, venture capital, real estate investments, and cash equivalents. The Company\u2019s investment policy does not permit direct investment in certain types of assets, such as options or commodities, or the use of certain strategies, such as short selling or the purchase of securities on margin.\nThe Company\u2019s investment strategy for its qualified pension plan assets is to achieve a diversified mix of investments that provides for long-term growth at an acceptable level of risk, and to provide sufficient liquidity to fund ongoing benefit payments. The Company has engaged a number of investment managers to implement various investment strategies to achieve the desired asset class mix, liquidity and risk diversification objectives.\nThe Company\u2019s target and actual asset allocations at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nThe Company\u2019s investments in equity securities primarily include domestic large-cap and mid-cap companies, but also includes an allocation to small-cap and international equity securities. Equity investments do not include any direct holdings of the Company\u2019s stock but may include such holdings to the extent that the stock is included as part of certain mutual fund holdings. Debt securities include investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Other types of investments include funds that invest in commercial real estate assets. All assets within specific funds are allocated to the target asset allocation of the fund.\nThe expected return on plan assets is principally based on the Company\u2019s historical returns combined with the Company\u2019s long-term future expectations regarding asset class returns, the mix of plan assets, and inflation assumptions. Actual return on plan assets for the periods presented are as follows:\nThe Company\u2019s pension plan assets are held in a master trust and are stated at estimated fair values of the underlying investments. Purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade-date basis. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Dividends are recorded on the ex-dividend date.\nEquity Securities: Domestic and international common stocks are valued by obtaining quoted prices on recognized and highly liquid exchanges.\nFixed Income Securities: Corporate bonds and U.S. government treasury and agency securities are valued based upon the closing price reported in the market in which the security is traded. U.S. government agency and corporate asset-backed securities may utilize models, such as a matrix pricing model, that incorporate other observable inputs when broker/dealer quotes are not available, such as cash flow, security structure, or market information.\nReal Estate Funds: The fair value of real estate funds is determined by the issuer based on their net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d). NAV is determined by dividing the fund\u2019s net assets, as recorded in the fund\u2019s audited financial statements, by the number of units outstanding at the valuation date. Fair value for underlying investments in real estate is determined through independent property appraisals.\nThe fair values of the Company\u2019s pension plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 by asset category were as follows:\n(1) Real estate funds for which fair value is measured using the NAV per share as a practical expedient are not leveled within the fair value hierarchy and are included as a reconciling item to total plan assets.\nContributions to each of the qualified single-employer defined benefit pension plans are determined annually by the Company\u2019s pension administrative committee, based upon the actuarially determined minimum required contribution under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), as amended, the Pension Protection Act of 2006, and the maximum deductible contribution allowed for tax purposes. The Company\u2019s funding policy is to contribute cash to its pension plans so that it meets at least the minimum contribution requirements. In 2020 and 2019, the Company contributed $9.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively, in pension contributions in these plans. There were no contributions to the plans in 2018.\nThe benefit formulas for employees who are members of collective bargaining units are determined according to the collective bargaining agreements, either using final average pay as the base or a flat dollar amount per year of service.\nEffective December 31, 2011, the Company froze benefit accruals under the final average pay formula for salaried, non-bargaining unit employees hired before January 1, 2008 and transitioned them to the same cash balance formula for employees hired on or after January 1, 2008. Retirement benefits under the cash balance formula are based on a fixed percentage of employee eligible compensation, plus interest. The plan interest credit rate will vary from year to year based on the ten-year U.S. Treasury rate.\nBenefit Plan Assets and Obligations: The measurement date for the Company\u2019s benefit plan disclosures is December 31 of each year.\nThe status of the funded qualified defined benefit pension plans and the unfunded post-retirement benefit plans at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are shown below:\nQualified pension and post-retirement benefits plans liabilities recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and expenses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nThe information for qualified defined benefit pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are shown below:\nUnrecognized gains and losses of the post-retirement benefit plans are amortized over five years. Although current health care costs are expected to increase, the Company attempts to mitigate these increases by maintaining caps on certain of its benefit plans, using lower cost health care plan options where possible, requiring that certain groups of employees pay a portion of their benefit costs, self-insuring for certain insurance plans, encouraging wellness programs for employees, and implementing measures to mitigate future benefit cost increases.\nComponents of the net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) for the qualified pension plans and the post-retirement benefit plans during 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nThe weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit information during 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n(1) The Company derives a single equivalent rate utilizing a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds with various maturities.\nNon-qualified Pension Plans: The Company has non-qualified supplemental pension plans covering certain employees and retirees, which provide for incremental pension payments from the Company\u2019s general funds so that total pension benefits would be substantially equal to amounts that would have been payable from the Company\u2019s qualified pension plans if it were not for limitations imposed by income tax law. A few employees and retirees receive additional supplemental pension benefits. Non-qualified pension plan liabilities recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and expenses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nDiscount rates of 1.8 percent and 2.8 percent were used in determining the 2020 and 2019 non-qualified pension plan obligations, respectively.\nEstimated Benefit Payments: The estimated future benefit payments for the next ten years as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:\n(1) Net of plan participants\u2019 contributions and Medicare Part D subsidies.\nDefined Contribution Plans: The Company sponsors defined contribution plans that qualify under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company may make discretionary matching contributions equal to a specified percentage of each participant\u2019s 401(k) contributions and makes other non-discretionary contributions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company provided discretionary matching contributions of up to 3 percent of eligible employee compensation. The Company\u2019s matching contributions expensed in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $3.0 million, $2.9 million and $2.4 million, respectively.\nThe Company may also provide a discretionary profit sharing contribution under the qualified defined contribution plans, to salaried, non-bargaining unit employees, if both a minimum threshold of Company performance is achieved and the Board has approved the profit sharing contribution. For certain eligible employees, supplemental profit sharing contributions are credited under a non-qualified plan to be paid after separation from service from the Company\u2019s general funds so that total profit sharing contributions would be substantially equal to amounts that would have been contributed to the Company\u2019s qualified defined contribution plans if it were not for limitations imposed by income tax law. Discretionary profit sharing contributions expensed in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $2.2 million, $0.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively.\nMulti-employer Bargaining Plans:\nThe Company contributes to multi-employer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover its bargaining unit employees. Contributions are generally based on amounts paid for union labor or cargo volume. The risks of participating in multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans because assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other\nparticipating employers. Additionally, if one employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.\nThe multi-employer pension plans are subject to the plan termination insurance provisions of ERISA and are paying premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\u201cPBGC\u201d). The statutes provide that an employer who withdraws from, or significantly reduces its contribution obligation to, a multi-employer plan generally will be required to continue funding its proportional share of the plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits. As of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s estimated benefit plan withdrawal obligations were $260.0 million. Except as described in Note 12, no withdrawal obligations have been recorded by the Company in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, as the Company has no present intention of withdrawing from and does not anticipate termination of any of these plans.\nInformation regarding the Company\u2019s participation in multi-employer pension plans is outlined in the table below. The \u201cEIN/Pension Plan Number\u201d column provides the Employer Identification Number (\u201cEIN\u201d) and the three-digit plan number, if applicable. Unless otherwise noted, the most recent Pension Protection Act zone status available in 2020 and 2019 is for the plan\u2019s year-end at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The zone status is based on information that the Company received from the plan and is certified by the plan\u2019s actuary. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65 percent funded; plans in the orange zone are both a) less than 80 percent funded and b) have an accumulated/expected funding deficiency in any of the next six plan years, net of any amortization extensions; plans in the yellow zone meet either one of the criteria mentioned in the orange zone; and plans in the green zone are at least 80 percent funded. The funding improvement plan (\u201cFIP\u201d) or rehabilitation plan (\u201cRP\u201d) column indicates the status which is either pending or has been implemented. The last column lists the expiration dates of the collective-bargaining agreements to which the plans are subject.\n(1) The Hawaii Terminals Multiemployer Pension Plan merged into the Hawaii Stevedoring Multiemployer Retirement Plan effective January 1, 2021 and formally known as the Hawaii Longshore Pension Plan.\n(2) Represents the expiration date of the collective bargaining agreement.\n(3) The Company does not make contributions directly to the Seafarers Pension Plan. Instead, contributions are made to the Seafarers Health and Benefits Plan, and are subsequently re-allocated to the Seafarers Pension Plan at the discretion of the plan Trustee.\nThe Company also contributes to multi-employer plans that provide post-retirement health and other benefits other than pensions under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements. Benefits provided to active and retired employees and their eligible dependents under these plans include medical, dental, vision and prescription drug. These plans are not subject to the PBGC plan termination and withdrawal liability provisions of ERISA applicable to multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. Contributions for these multi-employer postretirement health and other benefits were $32.5 million, $32.8 million and $30.0 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nMulti-employer Defined Contribution Plans: The Company contributes to six multi-employer defined contribution pension plans. These plans are not subject to the withdrawal liability provisions of ERISA or the PBGC applicable to multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. Contributions made to these plans by the Company were $5.1 million, $5.3 million and $4.8 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n12.\nMULTI-EMPLOYER WITHDRAWAL LIABILITIES\nHorizon ceased all of its operations in Puerto Rico during the first quarter of 2015, which resulted in a mass withdrawal from its multi-employer ILA-PRSSA pension fund. The Company assumed this liability as part of the acquisition of Horizon on May 29, 2015. The Company estimated the mass withdrawal liability based upon the required undiscounted quarterly payment of approximately $1.0 million to be paid to the ILA-PRSSA pension fund over a period which ends in March 2040, discounted to present value using the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Future estimated annual payments to be paid to the ILA-PRSSA pension fund as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nFurthermore, the Company assumed a partial withdrawal liability related to the Local 153 Fund of the OPEIU. The partial withdrawal liability resulted from a decline in the number of contribution base units related to the Local 153 Fund caused by Horizon terminating all of its operations in Puerto Rico during the first quarter of 2015. The Company included the partial withdrawal liability of $6.5 million and $6.7 million within other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n13.ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nChanges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component, net of tax, are as follows:\nOther comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income is shown net of tax benefit (expense) of $4.2 million, $(0.3) million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n14.EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share are determined by dividing net income by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the year. The calculation of diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of unexercised non-qualified stock options and non-vested stock units. The computation of weighted average dilutive shares outstanding excluded a nominal amount of anti-dilutive non-qualified stock options for each of the years 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nThe denominators used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\n15.\nSHARE-BASED AWARDS\nThe Company has share-based compensation plans which are described as follows:\n2016 Incentive Compensation Plan: The 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan (the \u201c2016 Plan\u201d) serves as a successor to the 2007 Incentive Compensation Plan and all other predecessor plans. No further grants will be made under the predecessor stock option plans. Under the 2016 Plan, 2.5 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. Shareholders approved the 2016 Plan at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\nThe 2016 Plan consists of four separate incentive compensation programs: (i) the discretionary grant program, (ii) the stock issuance program, (iii) the incentive bonus program, and (iv) the automatic grant program for the non-employee members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. Share-based compensation is generally awarded under three of the four programs, as more fully described below.\nDiscretionary Grant Program - Under the Discretionary Grant Program, stock options may be granted with an exercise price no less than 100 percent of the fair market value (defined as the closing market price) of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of the grant. Options generally become exercisable ratably over three years and have a maximum contractual term of 10 years.\nStock Issuance Program - Under the Stock Issuance Program, shares of common stock, restricted stock units or performance shares may be granted. Time-based equity awards generally vest ratably over three years. Provided certain three-year performance targets are achieved, performance-based equity awards generally vest on the three-year anniversary date of the grant.\nAutomatic Grant Program - At each annual shareholder meeting, non-employee directors will receive an award of restricted stock units that entitle the holder to an equivalent number of shares of common stock upon vesting, under the automatic grant program. Awards of restricted stock units granted under the program generally vest on the one-year anniversary of the grant date.\nThe shares of common stock authorized to be issued under the 2016 Plan may be drawn from shares of the Company\u2019s authorized but unissued common stock or from shares of its common stock that the Company acquires, including shares purchased on the open market or in private transactions.\nShare-based compensation expense and other information related to share-based awards for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options. As of December 31, 2020, unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock units and performance-based equity awards was $17.7 million. Unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.7 years.\nStock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 was as follows (in thousands, except weighted average exercise price and weighted average contractual life):\nThe following table summarizes non-vested restricted stock unit activity through December 31, 2020 (in thousands, except weighted average grant-date fair value amounts):\n(1) Represents shares paid out above target.\n16.FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company values its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques for fair value measurements. Level 1 inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. If the technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy, the lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy.\nThe Company uses Level 1 inputs for the fair values of its cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, and Level 2 inputs for its variable and fixed rate debt. The fair values of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, and variable rate debt approximate their carrying values due to the nature of the instruments. The fair value of fixed rate debt is calculated based upon interest rates available for debt with terms and maturities similar to the Company\u2019s existing debt arrangements.\nThe carrying value and fair value of the Company\u2019s financial instruments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n17.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCommitments and contractual obligations, excluding debt obligations (see Note 8), lease commitments (see Note 9), pension and post-retirement plan commitments, and multi-employer bargaining plan withdrawal obligations (see Note 11 and 12), are as follows as of December 31, 2020:\n(1) Standby letters of credit are required for the Company\u2019s uninsured workers\u2019 compensation and other insurance programs, and other needs.\n(2) Bonds are required for U.S. Customs and other related matters.\n(3) Vendor and other obligations include: (i) non-cancellable contractual capital project obligations; (ii) dry-docking related obligations; and (iii) other contractual obligations. Amounts are considered obligations if a contract has been agreed to specifying significant terms of the contract, and the amounts are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThese amounts are not recorded on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets and it is not expected that the Company or its subsidiaries will be called upon to advance funds under these commitments.\nContingencies: Contingencies and other litigation related matters are described as follows:\nEnvironmental Matters: The Company\u2019s Ocean Transportation segment has certain risks that could result in expenditures for environmental remediation. The Company believes that based on all information available to it, the Company is currently in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nOther Matters: The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to, or may be contingently liable in connection with other legal actions arising in the normal course of their businesses, the outcomes of which, in the opinion of management after consultation with counsel, would not have a material effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n18.\nQUARTERLY INFORMATION (Unaudited)\nSegment results by quarter for 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nThe following infrequent transactions impacted the Company\u2019s quarterly segment results during the year ended December 31, 2019.
