    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS\nAbbott Laboratories is an Illinois corporation, incorporated in 1900. Abbott\u2019s* principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a broad and diversified line of health care products.\nNARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nAbbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices.\nEstablished Pharmaceutical Products\nThese products include a broad line of branded generic pharmaceuticals manufactured worldwide and marketed and sold outside the United States in emerging markets. These products are generally sold directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, pharmacies, and independent retailers from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with, or licensed from, other companies.\nThe principal products included in the broad therapeutic area portfolios of the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment are:\n\u25cf gastroenterology products, including Creon\u2122, for the treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency associated with several underlying conditions, including cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis; Duspatal\u2122 and Dicetel\u2122, for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome or biliary spasm; Heptral\u2122, Transmetil\u2122, and Samyr\u2122, for the treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis (associated with liver disease) or depressive symptoms; and Duphalac\u2122, for regulation of the physiological rhythm of the colon;\n\u25cf women\u2019s health products, including Duphaston\u2122, for the treatment of many different gynecological disorders; and Femoston\u2122, a hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women;\n\u25cf cardiovascular and metabolic products, including Lipanthyl\u2122 and TriCor\u2122, for the treatment of dyslipidemia; Teveten\u2122 and Teveten\u2122 Plus, for the treatment of essential hypertension, and Physiotens\u2122, for the treatment of hypertension; and Synthroid\u2122, for the treatment of hypothyroidism;\n\u25cf pain and central nervous system products, including Serc\u2122, for the treatment of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease and vestibular vertigo; Brufen\u2122, for the treatment of pain, fever, and inflammation; and Sevedol\u2122, for the treatment of severe migraines; and\n\u25cf respiratory drugs and vaccines, including the anti-infective clarithromycin (sold under the trademarks Biaxin\u2122, Klacid\u2122, and Klaricid\u2122); and Influvac\u2122, an influenza vaccine.\nThe Established Pharmaceutical Products segment directs its primary marketing efforts toward building strong brands with key stakeholders, including consumers, pharmacists, physicians, and other healthcare providers. Government agencies are also important customers.\nCompetition in the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment is generally from other health care and pharmaceutical companies. In addition, the substitution of generic drugs for the brand prescribed and introduction of additional forms of already marketed established products by generic or branded competitors may increase competitive pressures.\n* As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the term \u201cAbbott\u201d refers to Abbott Laboratories, an Illinois corporation, or Abbott Laboratories and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.\nDiagnostic Products\nThese products include a broad line of diagnostic systems and tests manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories, clinics, physicians\u2019 offices, retailers, government agencies, alternate care testing sites, and plasma protein therapeutic companies from Abbott owned distribution centers, public warehouses or third party distributors.\nThe principal products included in the Diagnostic Products segment are:\n\u25cf core laboratory systems in the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology, and transfusion medicine, including the Alinity\u00ae family of instruments, ARCHITECT\u00ae, ABBOTT PRISM\u00ae, and Cell-Dyn\u00ae, with assays used for screening and/or diagnosis for cancer, cardiac, metabolics, drugs of abuse, fertility, general chemistries, infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV, therapeutic drug monitoring, and a suite of SARS-CoV-2 serology assays;\n\u25cf molecular diagnostics polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrument systems, including Alinity\u00ae m and m2000\u2122 that automate the extraction, purification, and preparation of DNA and RNA from patient samples, and detect and measure infectious agents including HIV, hepatitis, HPV, sexually transmitted infections, and SARS-CoV-2; and products for oncology with the Vysis\u00ae FISH product line of genomic-based tests;\n\u25cf point of care systems, including the i-STAT\u00ae and next-generation i-STAT\u00ae Alinity\u00ae and cartridges for testing blood gas, chemistry, electrolytes, coagulation and immunoassay;\n\u25cf rapid diagnostics lateral flow testing products in the area of infectious diseases, including respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, HIV, hepatitis, and tropical diseases such as malaria and dengue fever; molecular point-of-care testing for HIV, including the m-PIMA\u00ae HIV-1/2 Viral Load Test, and for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A & B, RSV and strep A, including the ID NOW\u00ae rapid molecular system; cardiometabolic testing, including Afinion\u00ae and Cholestech\u2122 platforms and tests; a toxicology business for drug and alcohol testing; and remote patient monitoring and consumer self-testing; and\n\u25cf informatics and automation solutions for use in laboratories, including laboratory automation systems, the RALS\u00ae point of care solution, and AlinIQ\u00ae, a suite of informatics tools and professional services.\nThe Diagnostic Products segment\u2019s products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, instrument warranty provisions, product performance, laboratory efficiency, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products.\nNutritional Products\nThese products include a broad line of pediatric and adult nutritional products manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to consumers and to institutions, wholesalers, retailers, health care facilities, government agencies, and third-party distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers or third-party distributors.\nThe principal products included in the Nutritional Products segment are:\n\u25cf various forms of prepared infant formula and follow-on formula, including Similac\u00ae*, Similac Pro-Advance\u00ae*, Similac\u00ae Advance\u00ae, Similac\u00ae Advance\u00ae Non-GMO, Similac Pro-Sensitive\u00ae*, Similac Sensitive\u00ae, Similac Sensitive\u00ae Non-GMO, Go&Grow by Similac\u00ae*, Similac\u00ae NeoSure\u00ae, Similac\u00ae Organic, Similac\u00ae Special Care\u00ae, Similac Total Comfort\u00ae*, Similac\u00ae For Supplementation, Isomil\u00ae Advance\u00ae, Isomil\u00ae, Alimentum\u00ae, Gain\u2122, Grow\u2122, Similac En Mei Li\u2122, and Eleva\u2122;\n\u25cf adult and other pediatric nutritional products, including Ensure\u00ae, Ensure Plus\u00ae, Ensure\u00ae Enlive\u00ae, Ensure\u00ae (with NutriVigor\u00ae), Ensure\u00ae Max Protein, Ensure\u00ae High Protein, Glucerna\u00ae, Glucerna Hunger Smart\u00ae, ProSure\u2122, PediaSure\u00ae, PediaSure SideKicks\u00ae, PediaSure\u00ae Peptide, EleCare\u00ae, Juven\u00ae, Abound\u2122, Pedialyte\u00ae and Zone Perfect\u00ae; and\n\u25cf nutritional products used in enteral feeding in health care institutions, including Jevity\u00ae, Glucerna\u00ae 1.2 Cal, Glucerna\u00ae 1.5 Cal, Osmolite\u00ae, Oxepa\u00ae, Freego\u2122 (Enteral Pump) and Freego\u2122 sets, Nepro\u00ae, and Vital\u00ae.\n* These products are available with 2'-FL HMO (Human Milk Oligosaccharide) in several markets.\nPrimary marketing efforts for nutritional products are directed toward consumers or to securing the recommendation of Abbott\u2019s brand of products by physicians or other health care professionals. In addition, certain nutritional products sold as Similac\u00ae, Gain\u2122, Grow\u2122, Eleva\u2122, PediaSure\u00ae, PediaSure SideKicks\u00ae, Pedialyte\u00ae, Ensure\u00ae, Zone Perfect\u00ae, and Glucerna\u00ae are also promoted directly to the public by consumer marketing efforts in select markets where appropriate.\nCompetition for nutritional products in the segment is generally from other diversified consumer and health care manufacturers. Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, price, retail distribution, and availability of product forms. A significant aspect of competition is the search for ingredient innovations. The introduction of new products by competitors, changes in medical practices and procedures, and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers\u2019 products may increase competitive pressure.\nMedical Devices\nThese products include a broad line of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular and structural heart devices for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes care products for people with diabetes, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders. Medical devices are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide. In the United States, depending upon the product, medical devices are generally marketed and sold directly to wholesalers, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, physicians\u2019 offices, and distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served.\nThe principal products included in the Medical Devices segment are:\n\u25cf rhythm management products, including Assurity MRI\u00ae and Endurity MRI\u00ae pacemaker systems; Ellipse\u00ae, Fortify Assura\u00ae, and Gallant\u2122 implantable cardioverter defibrillators and Gallant and Quadra Assura MP\u00ae implantable cardioverter defibrillator with cardiac resynchronization therapy and MultiPoint\u00ae Pacing technology; and Confirm Rx\u00ae implantable cardiac monitor;\n\u25cf electrophysiology products, including the TactiCath\u00ae family of ablation catheters and FlexAbility\u00ae irrigated ablation catheters; Ampere\u00ae RF ablation generator; EnSite\u00ae family of cardiac mapping systems; and the Advisor\u00ae HD Grid mapping catheter;\n\u25cf heart failure related products, including the HeartMate\u2122 left ventricular device family and the CardioMEMS\u00ae HF System pulmonary artery sensor, a heart failure monitoring system;\n\u25cf vascular products, including the XIENCE\u2122 family of drug-eluting coronary stent systems developed on the Multi-Link Vision\u00ae platform; StarClose SE\u00ae and Perclose ProGlide\u00ae vessel closure devices, TREK\u00ae coronary balloon dilatation products, Hi-Torque Balance Middleweight Universal II\u00ae guidewires, Supera\u00ae Peripheral Stent System, a peripheral vascular stent system; Acculink\u00ae/Accunet\u00ae and Xact\u00ae/Emboshield NAV6\u00ae, carotid stent systems; and the OPTIS\u00ae integrated system with the Dragonfly OPTIS\u00ae imaging catheter and PressureWire\u00ae fractional flow reserve measurement systems;\n\u25cf structural heart products, including MitraClip\u00ae, a percutaneous mitral valve repair system; Trifecta\u00ae Valve with Glide\u2122 Technology, a surgical tissue heart valve; Portico\u00ae transcatheter aortic heart valve; Regent\u2122 mechanical heart valve; Amplatzer\u00ae PFO occluders; Amplatzer Amulet\u00ae occluder devices; the Tendyne\u00ae Transcatheter Mitral Valve Implantation (TMVI) system; and the TriClip\u00ae Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Repair System;\n\u25cf continuous glucose and blood glucose monitoring systems, including test strips, sensors, data management decision software, and accessories for people with diabetes, under the FreeStyle\u00ae brand such as the FreeStyle Libre\u00ae system; and\n\u25cf neuromodulation products, including spinal cord stimulators Proclaim\u00ae Elite and Proclaim\u00ae XR Recharge-free implantable pulse generators (IPG) and Prodigy MRI\u00ae IPG, each with BurstDR\u00ae stimulation, and Proclaim\u00ae DRG IPG, a neurostimulation device designed for dorsal root ganglion therapy, for the treatment of chronic pain disorders; and the Infinity\u00ae Deep Brain Stimulation System with directional lead technology for the treatment of movement disorders.\nThese products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, product performance, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products.\nINFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ABBOTT\u2019S BUSINESS IN GENERAL\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials\nAbbott purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to Abbott\u2019s operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and around the world. There have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages for raw materials or supplies.\nPatents, Trademarks, and Licenses\nAbbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products. Accordingly, where possible, patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for Abbott\u2019s products in the United States and countries of interest to Abbott. Abbott owns or has licenses under a substantial number of patents and patent applications. Principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the Narrative Description of Business on pages 1 through 4. These, and various patents which expire during the period 2021 to 2041, in the aggregate, are believed to be of material importance in the operation of Abbott\u2019s business. Abbott believes that no single patent, license, or trademark is material in relation to Abbott\u2019s business as a whole.\nSeasonal Aspects, Customers, and Renegotiation\nThere are no significant seasonal aspects to Abbott\u2019s business. Abbott has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on Abbott. No material portion of Abbott\u2019s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government.\nEnvironmental Matters\nAbbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. Abbott\u2019s capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2020 were not material and are not expected to be material in 2021.\nAbbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which are owned by Abbott, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, Abbott believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott\u2019s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.\nHuman Capital\nThe sustainability of Abbott\u2019s business depends on attracting, engaging and developing talented people with diverse backgrounds who share Abbott\u2019s mission to help people live their healthiest possible lives. Abbott provides its employees opportunities to grow and develop their careers, market competitive compensation and benefit programs, and the satisfaction of being part of a global company dedicated to improving health in more than 160 countries.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Abbott employed approximately 109,000 people, 70% of whom were employed outside of the U.S. Women represented 47% of Abbott\u2019s U.S. workforce, 45% of its global workforce, and 39% of its managers.\nHealth and Safety\nThe health, safety and wellness of its employees is an Abbott priority embedded at every level of its business. Abbott\u2019s integrated Environmental, Health and Safety organization governs health, safety and wellness at Abbott\u2019s facilities. Abbott also maintains global policies and standards for managing employee health and safety.\nAbbott takes a holistic approach to employee well-being. Abbott\u2019s global wellness programs are designed to meet the unique needs of employees across businesses and geographies and offer a wide range of programs, including supporting the mental, financial and physical health of employees and their families. For example, for over 20 years, Abbott has annually offered Exercise Across Abbott, which is a four-week physical wellness program that encourages employees to team up with colleagues and track how many minutes they exercise each day. Over 22,000 Abbott employees across 72 countries took part in 2020.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees, including implementing mandatory temperature screening and social distancing, providing and requiring the use of personal protective equipment, and at most U.S. facilities, onsite COVID-19 testing.\nTalent Management\nAbbott has an integrated global talent management process that is designed to identify and assess talent across the organization and provide equal and consistent opportunities for employees to develop their skills. All levels of employees participate in Abbott\u2019s annual performance management process to create development plans that support their particular career objectives, and Abbott provides a broad range of training, mentoring and other development opportunities to help its employees meet these objectives. The board of directors conducts an annual Talent Management Review, focusing on development of talent, diversity, and succession planning for critical positions. Similar reviews take place at every level of Abbott to develop talent and diversity across the organization.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nAbbott is committed to developing a workplace that is inclusive for all. Abbott ties executive compensation to human capital management, including diversity outcomes, to sustain an inclusive culture and the fair and balanced treatment of Abbott\u2019s employees.\nAbbott\u2019s employee networks play an important role in building an inclusive culture across all Abbott operations. A member of Abbott\u2019s senior management serves as a sponsor for each of these networks, helping to align their objectives with Abbott\u2019s business strategies. Abbott has ten such networks, which are: Advancing Professionals Network (supporting early career employees), Asian Leadership and Cultural Network, Black Business Network, Flex Network (employees with part-time and flexible schedules), LA VOICE Network (supporting Hispanic and Latino employees), People with Disabilities Network, PRIDE (supporting LGBTQ employees), Veterans Network, Women Leaders of Abbott, and Women in STEM.\nAbbott offers professional development programs, which provide recent college graduates the opportunity to rotate through different areas of Abbott, often with the chance to work outside their home country. In 2020, 52% of the participants were women. Also, Abbott hosts hundreds of college students for paid internships. In 2020, 55% of the U.S. interns were women and 39% were minorities. Further, Abbott has operated a STEM internship program for high school students in the U.S. since 2012. The program\u2019s objective is to increase the number of students pursuing STEM-related careers and contribute to a more diverse talent pipeline for Abbott. In 2020, 58% of the STEM interns were women and 71% were minorities.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAbbott is committed to building, retaining, and motivating a diverse talent pipeline that can meet the current and future needs of its businesses. To that end, Abbott provides market competitive compensation, healthcare benefits, pension and/or retirement savings plans, and several programs to facilitate employees building an ownership stake in Abbott, including a global long-term incentive program for employees generally beginning at the manager level. Abbott also has procedures and processes focused on providing employees equitable compensation, regardless of race or gender or other personal characteristics.\nRegulation\nThe development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of Abbott\u2019s products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar international regulatory agencies. Government regulation by various international, supranational, federal and state agencies addresses (among other matters) the development and approval to market Abbott\u2019s products, as well as the inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, supply chains, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage, and disposal practices. In addition, Abbott\u2019s clinical laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation, including registration, certification, and licensure, by federal, state, and local agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and their respective foreign counterparts. Certain of these agencies require our clinical laboratories to meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards and undergo inspections.\nDuring the COVID-19 public health emergency, many pandemic-related products (including diagnostic tests) were authorized by regulators for emergency use solely during the pandemic. In addition, many governments enacted policies to expedite or promote access to health care in order to slow or stop the spread of the virus. Examples include expansion of telehealth coverages and increased reimbursements for diagnostic testing. It is uncertain when the public health emergency will end and to what extent these policies will continue or revert back to previous policies.\nAbbott\u2019s international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries. These may require local investment, restrict Abbott\u2019s investments, or limit the import of raw materials and finished products.\nAbbott\u2019s laboratory facilities and home monitoring services, which provide services, related products and medical devices to consumers, are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to health care providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement to third-party payors. In the United States, Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors may from time to time conduct inquiries, claims audits, investigations, and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria.\nAbbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug, nutrition, and medical device manufacturers such as Abbott are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment, and other fees. Governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Abbott\u2019s business. Among other effects, health care regulations and significant changes thereto (such as the introduction of the Medical Device Regulation and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation in the European Union) substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in developing, obtaining and maintaining approval to market, and marketing newly developed and existing products. Abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product\u2019s production and sale, suspension or revocation of billing privileges, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. Similarly, compliance with the laws and regulations governing clinical laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in sanctions, including suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory\u2019s certification, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines or criminal penalties.\nAbbott\u2019s business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.\nAccess to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies, and private organizations in many countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payors and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. Abbott expects insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of health care products. Many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, or coverage limitations. Budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on Abbott\u2019s products for the foreseeable future. In the United States, the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical devices, diagnostics, supplies, and other products, as well as the procedures in which these products may be used. The government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home, and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Other payment methodology changes have been proposed and implemented from time to time. For example, Medicare implemented a competitive bidding system for certain durable medical equipment (including diabetes products), enteral nutrition products, and supplies. Additionally, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act established a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests in 2018.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act) includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. In October 2018, the Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act significantly expanded the types of healthcare providers for which reporting is required, beginning with reports filed in 2022. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties.\nPolicy changes or implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant changes to health care systems. In the United States, this could include potential modification, including expansion or repeal of all or parts of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe regulation of data privacy and security, and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information (including patient health information, financial information and other sensitive personal information), is increasing. For example, the European Union, various other countries, and various U.S. states (e.g., California) have enacted stricter data protection laws that contain enhanced financial penalties for noncompliance. Similarly, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules governing the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information, and the FDA has issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices. In addition, certain countries have issued or are considering \u201cdata localization\u201d laws, which limit companies\u2019 ability to transfer protected data across country borders. Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in business disruption and enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties. Transferring and managing protected information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended, and Abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area.\nGovernmental cost containment efforts also affect Abbott\u2019s nutritional products business. In the United States, for example, under regulations governing the federally funded Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula. As a result, through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program.\nAbbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the manufacture, quality assurance requirements, marketing authorization processes, post-market surveillance requirements, availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services, as well as data privacy and security. Abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect the timing and expense associated with bringing health care products or services to market, access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical, nutrition, diagnostic, and medical device industries, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above.\nINTERNET INFORMATION\nCopies of Abbott\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through Abbott\u2019s investor relations website (www.abbottinvestor.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after Abbott electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission).

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbott\u2019s securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott\u2019s actual results. Abbott\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nAbbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.\nAbbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott\u2019s credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity.\nAbbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data, and a cyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott\u2019s results of operations.\nSimilar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott\u2019s information technology systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen. A significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, manufacturing challenges or disruption, problems with product functionality, damage to customer relations, lost revenue, and legal or regulatory penalties.\nAbbott also collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings. Abbott is subject to certain regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders. For additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation, see the discussion in \u201cRegulation\u201d under Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d A breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties.\nAbbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future. Similarly, there can be no assurance that third party information technology providers with whom Abbott contracts will not suffer a significant attack or disruption that impacts customers like Abbott. Any significant breach, attack or other disruption involving Abbott\u2019s systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott\u2019s business.\nAbbott\u2019s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott\u2019s revenue and profitability to decline.\nTo remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.\nPromising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott\u2019s existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry or regulatory standards, or competitors\u2019 innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott\u2019s products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott\u2019s revenues and operating results to suffer.\nThe manufacture of many of Abbott\u2019s products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott\u2019s business could suffer.\nThe manufacture of many of Abbott\u2019s products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product, those products may have to be discarded. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. Any of these events could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other lots, batches or products. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nAbbott has significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business, including decreasing its business flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $18.7 billion. This consolidated indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes.\nFurther, Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition.\nAdditionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nAbbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.\nAbbott\u2019s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, or diagnostic product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs.\nIn addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott\u2019s facilities and procedures and those of Abbott\u2019s suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott\u2019s products, and criminal prosecution.\nThese actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott\u2019s business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott\u2019s products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott\u2019s suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott\u2019s business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott\u2019s revenues, profitability and financial condition.\nLaws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future.\nAbbott\u2019s industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott\u2019s business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott\u2019s revenues, profitability, and financial condition.\nChanges in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott\u2019s business.\nBoth in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to Abbott\u2019s products\u2019 coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott\u2019s products or the prices that Abbott\u2019s customers are willing to pay for them.\nFurther, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 address access to health care products and services. These provisions may be modified, expanded, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law.\nFor additional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in \u201cRegulation\u201d under Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d\nThe expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect Abbott\u2019s future revenues and operating income.\nMany of Abbott\u2019s businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott\u2019s intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott\u2019s intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott\u2019s businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott\u2019s intellectual property rights, Abbott\u2019s future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigation regarding Abbott\u2019s patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nSignificant safety concerns could arise for Abbott\u2019s products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott\u2019s revenues and financial condition.\nHealth care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product\u2019s label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product\u2019s market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers\u2019 or competitors\u2019 products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott\u2019s products.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for, or injury to, patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott\u2019s business and reputation and on Abbott\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott\u2019s profitability and financial condition.\nEconomic and Industry Risks\nAbbott is subject to risks related to public health crises, such as widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a global healthcare company, public health crises, such as the widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively impact Abbott's operations. Health concerns and significant changes in political or economic conditions caused by such outbreaks can cause significant reductions in demand for routine diagnostic testing and medical device procedures or increased difficulty in serving customers, disrupt manufacturing and supply chains, and negatively affect our operations as well as the operations of our suppliers, distributors and other third-party partners. Furthermore, such widespread outbreaks may impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates.\nWith regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for several COVID-19 related products in 2020, including Abbott diagnostic tests. EUAs are authorized for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency unless sooner terminated or revoked. Abbott is actively pursuing the FDA\u2019s customary regulatory approval process for these diagnostic tests which has uncertainty as discussed in \u201cAbbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.\u201d in \u201cLegal and Regulatory Risks\u201d under \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nDue to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material effect on Abbott\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. A more detailed discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott\u2019s business is contained in the \u201cFinancial Review\u201d section in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report.\nAbbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income.\nIn the United States and other countries, Abbott\u2019s businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing. Cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned \u201cRegulation.\u201d To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors, Abbott\u2019s future revenues and operating income will be reduced.\nCompetitors\u2019 intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbott\u2019s future profitability and financial condition.\nCompetitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott\u2019s profitability and financial condition.\nNew products and technological advances by Abbott\u2019s competitors may negatively affect Abbott\u2019s results of operations.\nAbbott\u2019s products face intense competition from competitive products. Competitors\u2019 products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott\u2019s products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors\u2019 products.\nFluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements and Abbott\u2019s ability to realize projected sales and earnings.\nAlthough Abbott\u2019s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott\u2019s revenues and costs are realized in other currencies. Sales outside of the United States in 2020 made up approximately 62 percent of Abbott\u2019s net sales. Abbott\u2019s profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott\u2019s assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks.\nInformation on the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbott\u2019s financial results is contained in the \u201cFinancial Review - Results of Operations\u201d section in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Abbott\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K. Information on Abbott\u2019s hedging arrangements is contained in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this report.\nDeterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect Abbott\u2019s results of operations.\nUnfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including credit downgrades, could increase Abbott\u2019s collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott\u2019s receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where Abbott\u2019s customers depend on payment by government health care systems.\nThe international nature of Abbott\u2019s business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.\nAbbott\u2019s business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States in 2020 made up approximately 62 percent of Abbott\u2019s net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott\u2019s international operations include:\n\u25cf differing local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u25cf trade protection measures, including tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, and changes to international trade agreements;\n\u25cf difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations;\n\u25cf differing labor regulations;\n\u25cf potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u25cf political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;\n\u25cf restrictions on local currency conversion and/or cash extraction;\n\u25cf price controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action;\n\u25cf inflation, recession, and fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u25cf diminished protection of intellectual property; and\n\u25cf potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.\nEvents contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nOther factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott\u2019s future profitability and financial condition.\nMany other factors can affect Abbott\u2019s profitability and its financial condition, including:\n\u25cf changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards, product labeling standards, source and use laws, and environmental laws;\n\u25cf differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retiree health care, stock compensation, intangibles, goodwill, and contingent consideration; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;\n\u25cf changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value of Abbott\u2019s equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott\u2019s employee benefit trusts;\n\u25cf changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott\u2019s employee benefit trusts;\n\u25cf changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups;\n\u25cf changes in Abbott\u2019s business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future;\n\u25cf changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions, pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners; and\n\u25cf legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current expectations, estimates, and projections. Words such as \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cseeks,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d variations of these words, and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Certain factors, including but not limited to those identified under \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K, may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations, estimates, projections, forecasts, and from past results. No assurance can be made that any expectation, estimate, or projection contained in a forward-looking statement will be achieved or will not be affected by the factors cited above or other unknown or future events.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFinancial Review\nAbbott\u2019s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott\u2019s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott\u2019s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. Sales in international markets comprise approximately 62 percent of consolidated net sales.\nIn 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affected Abbott\u2019s diversified health care businesses in various ways. As is further described below, some businesses have performed at the levels required to successfully meet new demands, others have faced challenges, and still others have been relatively less impacted by the pandemic.\nAbbott\u2019s Diagnostics business experienced the most significant change in sales from 2019 to 2020 as sales from new tests and other related products to detect COVID-19 more than outweighed the negative impact of COVID-19 on routine diagnostic testing volumes. Abbott mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch the following new diagnostic tests for COVID-19 in 2020:\n\u25cf In March, Abbott launched a molecular test using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods on its m2000\u2122 RealTime lab-based platform to detect COVID-19 pursuant to an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the U.S. and CE Mark.\n\u25cf In March, Abbott also launched a molecular test to detect COVID-19 on its ID NOW\u2122 rapid point-of-care platform in the U.S. pursuant to an EUA.\n\u25cf In April, Abbott launched an IgG (Immunoglobulin G) lab-based serology blood test on its ARCHITECT\u00ae i1000SR and i2000SR\u00ae laboratory instruments for the detection of an antibody to determine if someone was previously infected with the virus. The serology test was granted an EUA in the U.S. and CE Mark in April.\n\u25cf In May, Abbott launched a lab-based serology blood test on its Alinity\u00ae i system pursuant to an EUA in the U.S. and CE Mark.\n\u25cf In May, Abbott also launched a molecular PCR test on its Alinity m system to detect COVID-19 pursuant to an EUA in the U.S. Abbott received CE Mark for this test in June.\n\u25cf In June, Abbott launched a lateral flow COVID-19 rapid antibody test on its Panbio\u2122 system in select countries pursuant to a CE Mark. This serology test detects an antibody to determine if someone was previously infected with the virus.\n\u25cf In August, Abbott launched its AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgM (Immunoglobulin M) lab-based serology test for use on its ARCHITECT and Alinity platforms pursuant to a CE Mark. Abbott was granted an EUA in the U.S. for this test in October.\n\u25cf In August, Abbott launched its BinaxNOW\u2122 COVID-19 Ag Card test, a portable, lateral flow rapid test to detect COVID-19 pursuant to an EUA in the U.S.\n\u25cf In September, Abbott launched its Panbio rapid antigen test to detect COVID-19 pursuant to a CE Mark. In October, Abbott received approval by the World Health Organization for emergency use listing for the Panbio antigen test.\n\u25cf In December, Abbott received CE Mark and launched its SARS-CoV-2-IgG II quantitative lab-based serology blood test for use on its ARCHITECT and Alinity i platforms.\n\u25cf In December, Abbott received an EUA in the U.S. for virtually guided at-home use of its BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card rapid test to detect COVID-19 and launched the product for at-home use.\n\u25cf In December, Abbott launched its multiplex molecular test on its Alinity m system to detect COVID-19, flu A, flu B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pursuant to a CE Mark.\nIn 2020, Abbott\u2019s COVID-19 testing related sales totaled approximately $3.884 billion, led by sales related to Abbott\u2019s BinaxNOW, Panbio and ID NOW rapid testing platforms.\nIn addition to negatively impacting routine core diagnostic testing volumes, the pandemic negatively affected the number of cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures performed by health care providers globally, thereby reducing the demand for Abbott\u2019s cardiovascular and neuromodulation devices and routine diagnostic tests in 2020. The decrease began in February in China as that country implemented quarantine restrictions and postponed non-emergency health care activities. The negative impact on cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures and routine diagnostic tests expanded to other countries and geographic regions as COVID-19 spread geographically in the first half of 2020 and health care systems in these countries shifted their focus to fighting COVID-19.\nThe extent of the impact and the timing of a recovery in the number of procedures and routine testing in a particular country or geographic region depended upon the progression of COVID-19 cases in the country or region. The recovery in procedures and routine testing volumes in China began in March. In other parts of the world, such as the U.S. and Europe, volumes improved across Abbott\u2019s hospital-based businesses as the second quarter progressed and the improvement continued in the third quarter. However, in the fourth quarter, the improving trends in the demand for procedures and routine testing flattened or were negatively impacted depending upon the business and the region as many countries experienced an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.\nAbbott\u2019s branded generic pharmaceuticals business was also negatively affected by the pandemic in 2020 as COVID-19 spread across emerging market countries in the second and third quarters of 2020. Abbott\u2019s nutritional and diabetes care businesses were the least affected by the pandemic as is further discussed below.\nAbbott is continually implementing business continuity plans in the face of the pandemic. Due to the critical nature of its products and services, Abbott was generally exempt from governmental orders issued during the first quarter of 2020 in the U.S. and other countries requiring businesses to cease operations. The majority of its office-based work was conducted remotely during the period of such governmental orders and the company implemented strict travel restrictions. As some governmental orders were lifted in May and June 2020, Abbott entered a new phase in its operations whereby some office-based employees started working at Abbott\u2019s offices on a rotational basis. As various governmental orders and guidelines were modified in the fourth quarter to put in place new restrictions, Abbott continued to ensure that its guidance was aligned with such restrictions. Abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees.\nDue to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain.\nWhile Abbott\u2019s 2020 sales were most significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in total sales over the last three years also reflects volume growth due to the introduction of new products across various businesses as well as higher sales of various existing products. Sales in emerging markets, which represent approximately 37 percent of total company sales, increased 2.0 percent in 2020 and 8.2 percent in 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. (Emerging markets include all countries except the United States, Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.)\nOver the last three years, Abbott\u2019s operating margin as a percentage of sales increased from 11.9 percent in 2018 to 14.2 percent in 2019 and 15.5 percent in 2020. The increase in 2020 reflects the sales volume increases in the rapid and molecular diagnostics businesses, partially offset by lower Medical Devices sales due to the impact of the pandemic and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. In addition, a reduction in the costs associated with business acquisitions and restructuring activities drove an improvement in operating margins from 2018 to 2020. In 2019, the increase in Abbott\u2019s operating margin also reflects margin improvement in various businesses and lower intangible amortization expense compared to 2018.\nWith respect to the performance of each reportable segment over the last three years, sales in the Medical Devices segment excluding the impact of foreign exchange decreased 3.8 percent in 2020 and increased 10.5 percent in 2019. The sales decrease in 2020 was driven by Abbott\u2019s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses due primarily to reduced procedure volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care. The sales increase in 2019 was driven primarily by higher Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Electrophysiology and Heart Failure sales.\nIn 2020, operating earnings for the Medical Devices segment decreased 19.4 percent. The operating margin profile decreased from 30.8 percent of sales in 2019 to 25.8 percent in 2020 primarily due to lower sales and manufacturing volumes as a result of the pandemic and pricing pressures on drug eluting stents (DES) as a result of market competition in the U.S. and other major markets.\nIn 2020, key product approvals in the Medical Devices segment included:\n\u25cf CE Mark for Abbott\u2019s Tendyne\u2122 Transcatheter Mitral Valve Implantation system for the treatment of significant mitral regurgitation (MR) in patients requiring a heart valve replacement who are not candidates for open-heart surgery or transcatheter mitral valve repair,\n\u25cf CE Mark for Abbott\u2019s TriClip\u00ae heart valve repair system, the world\u2019s first minimally invasive, clip-based device for repair of a leaky tricuspid heart valve,\n\u25cf U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of FreeStyle\u00ae Libre 2 as an integrated continuous glucose monitoring (iCGM) system for adults and children ages 4 and older with diabetes,\n\u25cf CE Mark for Abbott\u2019s FreeStyle Libre 3 system, which automatically delivers real time, up-to-the-minute glucose readings, 14-day accuracy and real-time glucose alarms,\n\u25cf CE Mark for the Libre Sense\u2122 Glucose Sport Biosensor that provides continuous glucose monitoring to help athletes better understand the efficacy of their nutrition choices on training and athletic performance,\n\u25cf U.S. FDA approval of the next-generation Gallant\u2122 implantable cardioverter defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator devices which help manage heart rhythm disorders and offer Bluetooth technology and a new patient smartphone app for improved remote monitoring and enhanced patient-physician engagement,\n\u25cf CE Mark for MitraClip\u00ae G4, Abbott\u2019s next-generation MitraClip mitral valve repair device,\n\u25cf CE Mark of EnSite\u2122 X EP System, a next-generation 3D cardiac mapping platform used for ablation therapy to treat abnormal heart rhythms,\n\u25cf U.S. FDA clearance and CE Mark of the IonicRF\u2122 Generator, a non-surgical, minimally invasive device that uses heat to target specific nerves for the management of chronic pain, and\n\u25cf U.S. FDA approval of updated labeling to allow Abbott\u2019s HeartMate 3\u2122 heart pump to be used in pediatric patients with advanced refractory left ventricular heart failure.\nIn Abbott\u2019s worldwide diagnostics business, sales increased 40.6 percent in 2020 and 5.9 percent in 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As was discussed above, sales growth in 2020 was driven by demand for Abbott's portfolio of COVID-19 diagnostics tests across its rapid and lab-based platforms, partially offset by lower volumes of routine laboratory testing due to the pandemic. Growth in 2019 reflected continued market penetration by the core laboratory business in the U.S. and internationally. The 2019 growth included the continued adoption by customers of Alinity, which is Abbott\u2019s integrated family of next-generation diagnostic systems and solutions that are designed to increase efficiency by running more tests in less space, generating test results faster and minimizing human errors while continuing to provide quality results.\nAbbott has regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, China, and other markets for the \u201cAlinity c\u201d and \u201cAlinity i\u201d instruments and has continued to build out its test menu for clinical chemistry and immunoassay diagnostics. Abbott has obtained regulatory approval for the \u201cAlinity h\u201d instrument for hematology in Europe and Japan. Abbott has also obtained regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Europe for the \u201cAlinity s\u201d (blood screening) and \u201cAlinity m\u201d (molecular) instruments and several testing assays.\nIn 2020, operating earnings for the Diagnostics segment increased 94.8 percent. The operating margin profile increased from 24.9 percent of sales in 2018 to 34.5 percent in 2020 primarily due to higher sales in 2020 in Rapid Diagnostics and Molecular Diagnostics, partially offset by lower volumes of routine testing in Core Laboratory.\nIn Abbott\u2019s worldwide nutritional products business, sales over the last three years were positively impacted by numerous new product introductions, including the roll-outs of human milk oligosaccharide, or HMO, in infant formula and of high-protein Ensure\u00ae, that leveraged Abbott\u2019s strong brands. Sales were also positively affected by demographics such as an aging population and an increasing rate of chronic disease in developed markets and the rise of a middle class in many emerging markets. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total adult nutrition sales increased 10.3 percent in 2020 and 6.6 percent in 2019 led by the continued growth of Ensure, Abbott\u2019s market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna\u00ae, Abbott\u2019s market-leading diabetes-specific nutrition brand, across several countries. The 2019 sales growth was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the discontinuation of a non-core product line in the U.S. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total pediatric nutrition sales increased 0.3 percent in 2020 and 3.4 percent in 2019 driven by the PediaSure\u00ae and Pedialyte\u00ae brands in the U.S. as well as infant and toddler product growth across several markets in Asia and Latin America, partially offset by challenging market dynamics in the infant category in Greater China. The 2020 increase was also driven by higher Similac\u00ae sales in the U.S.\nThe Established Pharmaceutical Products segment focuses on the sale of its products in emerging markets. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Established Pharmaceutical sales increased 1.9 percent in 2020 and 7.3 percent in 2019. The sales increases in 2020 and 2019 reflect higher sales in several geographies including India, China, Brazil and Russia. Operating margins decreased from 20.2 percent of sales in 2018 to 18.5 percent in 2020 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, product mix and lower gross margins.\nWith respect to Abbott\u2019s financial position, at December 31, 2020, Abbott\u2019s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments total approximately $7.1 billion compared to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2019. Abbott\u2019s long-term debt and short-term borrowings total $18.7 billion and $18.1 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAbbott declared dividends of $1.53 per share in 2020 compared to $1.32 per share in 2019, an increase of approximately 16 percent. Dividends paid totaled $2.560 billion in 2020 compared to $2.270 billion in 2019. The year-over-year change in the amount of dividends paid primarily reflects the increase in the dividend rate. In December 2020, Abbott increased the company\u2019s quarterly dividend by 25 percent to $0.45 per share from $0.36 per share, effective with the dividend paid in February 2021.\nIn 2021, Abbott will focus on continuing to meet the demand for COVID-19 tests and will continue to invest in product development areas that provide the opportunity for strong sustainable growth over the next several years. In its diagnostics business, Abbott will continue to focus on driving market adoption and geographic expansion of its Alinity suite of diagnostics instruments. In the medical devices business, Abbott will continue to focus on expanding its market position in various areas including diabetes care, structural heart, electrophysiology, and heart failure. In its nutritionals business, Abbott will continue to focus on driving growth globally and further enhancing its portfolio with the introduction of line extensions of its science-based products. In the established pharmaceuticals business, Abbott will continue to focus on growing its business with the depth and breadth of its portfolio in emerging markets.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nSales Rebates - In 2020, approximately 41 percent of Abbott\u2019s consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that Abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale. Most of these rebates and allowances in 2020 are in the Nutritional Products and Diabetes Care businesses. Abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018 amounted to approximately $3.3 billion, $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, or 20.1 percent, 19.1 percent and 19.0 percent of gross sales, respectively, based on gross sales of approximately $16.6 billion, $16.3 billion and $16.0 billion, respectively, subject to rebate. A one-percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately $166 million in 2020. Abbott considers a one-percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales. Other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately $207 million, $169 million and $175 million for cash discounts in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $232 million, $192 million and $191 million for returns in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbott\u2019s historical returns are low, and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods.\nManagement analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter. In the domestic nutritional business, management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the accruals. In the WIC business, estimates are required for the amount of WIC sales within each state where Abbott holds the WIC contract. The state where the sale is made, which is the determining factor for the applicable rebated price, is reliably determinable. Rebated prices are based on contractually obligated agreements generally lasting a period of two to four years. Except for a change in contract price or a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the WIC business in a state, accruals are based on historical redemption rates and data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the states submitting rebate claims. The USDA, which administers the WIC program, has been making its data available for many years. Management also estimates the states' processing lag time based on sales and claims data. Inventory in the retail distribution channel does not vary substantially. Management has access to several large customers' inventory management data, which allows management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the retail distribution channel. At December 31, 2020, Abbott had WIC business in 27 states.\nHistorically, adjustments to prior years\u2019 rebate accruals have not been material to net income. Abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. For government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation.\nIncome Taxes - Abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. Because Abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items is often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. Abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. In accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. Application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment. In the U.S., Abbott\u2019s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled. Undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable.\nPension and Post-Employment Benefits - Abbott offers pension benefits and post-employment health care to many of its employees. Abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high-quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbott\u2019s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date. A difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for years, can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. Low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans. At December 31, 2020, pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and (credits) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were net losses of $4.6 billion for Abbott\u2019s defined benefit plans and net losses of $419 million for Abbott\u2019s medical and dental plans. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method, in accordance with the rules for accounting for post-employment benefits. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five-year period.\nValuation of Intangible Assets - Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott\u2019s critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs. At December 31, 2020, goodwill amounted to $23.7 billion and net intangibles amounted to $14.8 billion. Amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to $2.1 billion in 2020, $1.9 billion in 2019 and $2.2 billion in 2018. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nLitigation - Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, \u201cContingencies.\u201d Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management\u2019s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known. Accordingly, Abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $90 million to $120 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures. Accruals of approximately $105 million have been recorded at December 31, 2020 for these proceedings and exposures. These accruals represent management\u2019s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, \u201cContingencies.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nSales\nThe following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last two years:\nThe increase in Total Net Sales in 2020 reflects volume growth in the Diagnostics and Nutritional Products segments. In Medical Devices, the impact of COVID-19 on Abbott\u2019s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses was partially offset by double-digit volume growth in Diabetes Care. The increase in Total Net Sales in 2019 reflects volume growth across all of Abbott\u2019s segments. The price declines related to the Medical Devices segment in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflect DES pricing pressures as a result of market competition in the U.S. and other major markets.\nA comparison of significant product and product group sales is as follows. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers.\nIn order to compute results excluding the impact of exchange rates, current year U.S. dollar sales are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then those amounts are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the prior year average foreign exchange rates.\nTotal Established Pharmaceutical Products sales increased 1.9 percent in 2020 and 7.3 percent in 2019, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. The Established Pharmaceutical Products segment is focused on several key emerging markets including India, Russia, China and Brazil. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total sales in these key emerging markets increased 2.6 percent in 2020 and 7.9 percent in 2019 due to higher sales in several geographies including China, Brazil, India and Russia. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales in Established Pharmaceuticals\u2019 other emerging markets decreased 0.5 percent in 2020 and increased 5.6 percent in 2019.\nTotal Nutritional Products sales increased 4.7 percent in 2020 and 4.8 percent in 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In 2020, International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased 4.1 percent as growth across Abbott\u2019s pediatric products in various countries in Southeast Asia was more than offset by challenging market dynamics in the infant category in Greater China. The 4.6 percent increase in 2019 International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by growth across Abbott\u2019s portfolio, including Similac and PediaSure in various countries in Asia and Latin America and Pedialyte in Latin America. This growth was partially offset by challenging market dynamics in the infant category in Greater China. In the U.S. Pediatric Nutritional business, sales increased 5.8 percent in 2020 and 1.9 percent in 2019, reflecting growth in Similac in 2020 and growth in PediaSure and Pedialyte in both years.\nIn the International Adult Nutritional business, sales increased 13.6 percent and 10.9 percent in 2020 and 2019, respectively, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to continued growth of Ensure and Glucerna in several countries. In 2020 U.S. Adult Nutritional sales increased 4.9 percent, primarily due to growth of Ensure. In 2019, U.S. Adult Nutritional sales were unchanged from 2018 due to the impact of Abbott\u2019s discontinuation of a non-core product line during the third quarter of 2018 that was offset by growth in other areas of the business.\nIn the Diagnostics segment, Core Laboratory sales decreased 2.8 percent in 2020, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, as the lower volume of routine testing performed in hospital and other laboratories due to COVID-19 was partially offset by sales of Abbott\u2019s COVID-19 laboratory-based tests for the detection of the IgG and IgM antibodies, which determine if someone was previously infected with the virus. Core Laboratory antibody testing-related sales on Abbott\u2019s ARCHITECT and Alinity i platforms were $268 million in 2020. The 225.7 percent increase in Molecular Diagnostics sales in 2020, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects higher volumes due to demand for Abbott\u2019s laboratory-based molecular tests for COVID-19 on its m2000 and Alinity m platforms. Abbott received U.S. FDA approval in March 2020 for its Alinity m molecular diagnostics system. Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $1.023 billion in 2020.\nIn Rapid Diagnostics, sales increased 112.3 percent in 2020, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to strong demand for Abbott\u2019s point-of-care COVID-19 molecular test on its ID NOW platform and its BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card test in the U.S. as well as international demand for COVID-19 rapid tests on its Panbio system and increased testing in the first quarter for the flu in the U.S. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of COVID-19 on routine diagnostic testing. Rapid Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $2.593 billion in 2020.\nIn the Diagnostics segment, the sales increase in 2019 was driven by above-market growth in Core Laboratory in the U.S. and internationally, where Abbott achieved continued adoption of its Alinity family of diagnostic instruments. The 6.3 percent decrease in 2019 Molecular sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects the negative impact of lower non-governmental organization purchases in Africa. In Rapid Diagnostics, sales growth in 2019 in various areas, including infectious disease testing in developed markets and cardio-metabolic testing, was mostly offset by lower than expected infectious disease testing sales in Africa.\nExcluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales decreased 3.8 percent and increased 10.5 percent in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, double-digit growth in Diabetes Care was more than offset by decreases in Abbott\u2019s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses due to the impact of COVID-19 and lower vascular sales in China in the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of a new national tender program. The 2019 sales increase was driven by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Electrophysiology and Heart Failure.\nThe 2020 and 2019 growth in Diabetes Care revenue was driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre, Abbott\u2019s continuous glucose monitoring system, internationally and in the U.S. In 2020, FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $2.635 billion, which reflected a 42.6 percent increase over 2019, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. FreeStyle Libre sales in 2019 were $1.842 billion, which reflected a 69.8 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over 2018 when sales totaled $1.128 billion.\nIn 2019, growth in Structural Heart revenue was broad-based across several areas of the business, including MitraClip, Abbott's market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation (MR), a leaky heart valve. 2019 growth in Electrophysiology revenue reflects higher sales of cardiac diagnostic and ablation catheters in both the U.S. and internationally. The growth in Heart Failure revenue in 2019 was driven by rapid market adoption in the U.S. of Abbott's HeartMate 3\u00ae Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) following FDA approval in October 2018 as a destination (long-term use) therapy for people living with advanced heart failure as well as higher sales of Abbott\u2019s CardioMEMS\u00ae heart failure monitoring system. In Vascular, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, sales in 2019 were flat as the 1.3 percent increase in coronary and endovascular product sales, which includes drug-eluting stents, balloon catheters, guidewires, vascular imaging/diagnostics products, vessel closure, carotid and other coronary and peripheral products, was offset by reductions in royalty and contract manufacturing revenue. In Rhythm Management, higher 2019 international sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, were offset by a 4.4 percent decrease in U.S. revenue. In 2019, the 2.4 percent decline in Neuromodulation sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects a 4.2 percent decline in U.S. sales.\nAbbott has periodically sold product rights to non-strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with Abbott\u2019s revenue recognition policies as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Related net sales were not significant in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nThe expiration of licenses and patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of Abbott. There are no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years that are expected to materially affect Abbott.\nIn April 2017, Abbott received a warning letter from the U.S. FDA related to its manufacturing facility in Sylmar, CA which was acquired by Abbott on January 4, 2017 as part of the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical). This facility manufactures implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, and monitors. Abbott prepared and executed a comprehensive plan of corrective actions. On April 28, 2020, Abbott received a letter from the FDA indicating that, based on the FDA\u2019s evaluation, it appeared that Abbott had addressed the items in the warning letter. As a result, the warning letter is considered closed.\nOperating Earnings\nGross profit margins were 50.5 percent of net sales in 2020, 52.5 percent in 2019 and 51.3 percent in 2018. In 2020, the decrease primarily reflects the mix of sales across Abbott\u2019s various businesses and operational inefficiencies due to the impact of COVID-19, as well as the increase in intangible asset amortization, the impairment of intangible assets and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on gross margin in 2020. In 2019, the increase primarily reflects lower intangible amortization expense and lower integration and restructuring costs.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $2.4 billion in 2020 and 2019, and $2.3 billion in 2018. R&D spending in 2020 was relatively flat compared to 2019 as the impact of the immediate expensing in 2019 of an R&D asset valued at $102 million that was acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc. (Cephea) was partially offset by the $55 million impairment of an in-process R&D intangible asset in 2020. R&D expense in 2020 also reflects lower integration and restructuring costs in 2020 related to R&D, partially offset by higher spending on various projects. R&D expenses in 2019 increased 6.1 percent, primarily reflecting the immediate expensing of the Cephea R&D asset as well as higher R&D spending in various businesses, primarily in Medical Devices, partially offset by the favorable effect of foreign exchange. In 2020, R&D expenditures totaled $1.3 billion for the Medical Devices segment, $608 million for the Diagnostic Products segment, $189 million for the Nutritional Products segment and $177 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were basically flat in 2020 and 2019 versus the respective prior years. In 2020, the favorable effect of foreign exchange, income of approximately $100 million from a litigation settlement in 2020, lower spending due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, and the impact of various cost saving initiatives were offset by higher spending to drive growth in various businesses. In 2019, the favorable effect of foreign exchange and lower acquisition-related integration costs offset higher selling and marketing costs to drive continued growth across various businesses.\nRestructurings\nFrom 2017 to 2020, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the Medical Devices segment, and Alere Inc. (Alere) into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. As of December 31, 2017, the accrued balance associated with these actions was $68 million. From 2018 to 2020, Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges totaling approximately $137 million, comprised of $13 million in 2020, $72 million in 2019 and $52 million in 2018. Approximately $30 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $15 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $92 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense over the last three years. As of December 31, 2020, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $25 million and primarily represent severance obligations.\nFrom 2016 to 2020, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $36 million in 2020, $66 million in 2019 and $28 million in 2018. Approximately $6 million in 2020, $16 million in 2019 and $10 million in 2018 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $2 million in 2020, $28 million in 2019 and $2 million in 2018 are recorded in Research and development, and approximately $28 million in 2020, $22 million in 2019 and $16 million in 2018 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense.\nInterest Expense and Interest (Income)\nInterest expense, net decreased $76 million in 2020 due to a reduction in interest expense resulting from the favorable impact of the euro debt financing in November 2019, the repayment of debt in December 2019 and a lower interest rate environment in 2020. In 2019, interest expense, net decreased $145 million due to the favorable impact of the euro debt financing in September 2018, as well as the repayment of debt in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019.\nDebt Extinguishment Costs\nOn December 19, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.9% Notes due 2021. Abbott incurred a charge of $63 million related to the early repayment of this debt.\nOn October 28, 2018, Abbott redeemed approximately $4 billion of debt, which included $750 million principal amount of its 2.00% Notes due 2020; $597 million principal amount of its 4.125% Notes due 2020; $900 million principal amount of its 3.25% Notes due 2023; $450 million principal amount of its 3.4% Notes due 2023; and $1.300 billion principal amount of its 3.75% Notes due 2026. Abbott incurred a net charge of $153 million related to the early repayment of this debt and the unwinding of related interest rate swaps.\nOn March 22, 2018, Abbott redeemed all of the $947 million principal amount of its 5.125% Notes due 2019, as well as $1.055 billion of the $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.35% Notes due 2019. Abbott incurred a net charge of $14 million related to the early repayment of this debt.\nOther (Income) Expense, net\nOther (income) expense, net, for 2020, 2019 and 2018 includes approximately $205 million, $225 million, and $160 million of income in each year, respectively, related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. Other (income) expense, net for 2020 also includes equity investment impairments that totaled approximately $115 million.\nTaxes on Earnings\nThe income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 10.0 percent in 2020, 9.6 percent in 2019 and 18.8 percent in 2018.\nIn 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the recognition of approximately $170 million of tax benefits associated with the impairment of certain assets, approximately $140 million of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years, and approximately $100 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include a $26 million increase to the transition tax associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The $26 million increase to the transition tax liability was the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. This adjustment increased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $1.53 billion.\nIn 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included approximately $100 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, an $86 million reduction of the transition tax and $68 million of tax expense resulting from tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2019 in India. The $86 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in 2019. In 2018, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included $98 million of net tax expense related to the settlement of Abbott\u2019s 2014-2016 federal income tax audit in the U.S., partial settlement of the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group\u2019s 2014 and 2015 federal income tax returns in the U.S. and audit settlements in various countries as well as approximately $90 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In 2018, Abbott also recorded $130 million of additional tax expense related to the TCJA; the $130 million reflected a $120 million increase in the transition tax from $2.89 billion to $3.01 billion and a $10 million reduction in the net benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nExclusive of these discrete items, tax expense was favorably impacted by lower tax rates and tax exemptions on foreign income primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Singapore, and Malta. Abbott benefits from a combination of favorable statutory tax rules, tax rulings, grants, and exemptions in these tax jurisdictions. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate.\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe net earnings of discontinued operations include income tax benefits of $24 million in 2020 and $39 million in 2018. The 2020 tax benefits primarily relate to the resolution of various tax positions related to Abbott\u2019s developed markets branded generic pharmaceuticals business which was sold to Mylan Inc. (Mylan) in 2015. The tax positions relate to years prior to the sale to Mylan. The 2018 tax benefits primarily relate to the resolution of various tax positions related to the operations of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) for years prior to the separation. Abbott completed the separation of AbbVie, which was formed to hold Abbott\u2019s research-based proprietary pharmaceuticals business, in January 2013. Abbott retained all liabilities for all U.S. federal and foreign income taxes on income prior to the separation.\nResearch and Development Programs\nAbbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical devices, diagnostic and nutritional products in development.\nResearch and Development Process\nIn the Established Pharmaceuticals segment, the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segment\u2019s existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers. As Established Pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research, development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity.\nDepending upon the product, the phases of development may include:\n\u25cf Drug product development.\n\u25cf Phase I bioequivalence studies to compare a future Established Pharmaceutical\u2019s brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).\n\u25cf Phase II studies to test the efficacy of benefits in a small group of patients.\n\u25cf Phase III studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use.\n\u25cf Phase IV and other post-marketing studies to obtain new clinical use data on existing products within approved indications.\nThe specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to 6 or more years for complex formulations, new indications, or geographic expansion in specific countries, such as China.\nIn the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include:\n\u25cf Discovery which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area, platform, or unmet clinical need.\n\u25cf Concept/Feasibility during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated, testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility.\n\u25cf Development during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meets specified design requirements and that the design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses.\nThe regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions. In the U.S., the FDA classifies diagnostic products into classes (I, II, or III) and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval. While the Diagnostics segment has products in all three classes, the vast majority of its products are categorized as Class I or Class II. Submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for Class I products. Class II devices typically require pre-market notification to the FDA through a regulatory filing known as a 510(k) submission. Most Class III products are subject to the FDA\u2019s Premarket Approval (PMA) requirements. Other Class III products, such as those used to screen blood, require the submission and approval of a Biological License Application (BLA).\nIn the European Union (EU), diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process, which has been governed by the European In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive, depends upon the category, with certain product categories requiring review and approval by an independent company, known as a Notified Body, before the manufacturer can affix a CE mark to the product to declare conformity to the Directive. Other products only require a self-certification process. In the second quarter of 2017, the EU adopted the new In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR) which replaces the existing directive in the EU for in vitro diagnostic products. The IVDR will apply after a five-year transition period and imposes additional premarket and postmarket regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products.\nIn the Medical Devices segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation, selection and qualification of a product design, completion of applicable clinical trials to test the product\u2019s safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications.\nSimilar to the diagnostic products discussed above, in the U.S., medical devices are classified as Class I, II, or III. Most of Abbott\u2019s medical device products are classified as Class II devices that follow the 510(k) regulatory process or Class III devices that are subject to the PMA process.\nIn the EU, medical devices are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process, which has been governed by the European Medical Device Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive, varies by class. Each product must bear a CE mark to show compliance with the Directive. In the second quarter of 2017, the EU adopted the new Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) which replaces the existing directives in the EU for medical devices and imposes additional premarket and postmarket regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. While the MDR was previously adopted to apply after a three year transition period, in 2020 the European Parliament postponed the date of application by one year.\nSome products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to CE marking of the device. For other products, the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can self-certify its ability to apply the CE mark to the product. Outside the U.S. and the EU, the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions.\nAfter approval and commercial launch of some medical devices, post-market trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority.\nIn the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants and adults) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product\u2019s efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted.\nIn the U.S., the FDA requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products. Prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change, the company is required to obtain the FDA\u2019s confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging. For other nutritional products, notification or pre-approval from the FDA is not required unless the product includes a new food additive. In some countries, regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products, including infant formula and medical nutritional products.\nAreas of Focus\nIn 2021 and beyond, Abbott\u2019s significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following:\nEstablished Pharmaceuticals - Abbott focuses on building country-specific portfolios made up of high-quality medicines that meet the needs of people in emerging markets. Over the next several years, Abbott plans to expand its product portfolio in key therapeutic areas with the aim of being among the first to launch new off-patent and differentiated medicines. In addition, Abbott continues to expand existing brands into new markets, implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities. Abbott is also actively working on the further development of several key brands such as Creon\u2122, Duphaston\u2122, Duphalac\u2122 and Influvac\u2122. Depending on the product, the activities focus on development of new data, markets, formulations, delivery systems, or indications. One example includes the launch of Abbott\u2019s quadrivalent influenza vaccination Influvac\u00ae Tetra in 12 markets and an expanded indication in 16 markets to cover children, adolescents and young adults from 3 to 17 years old.\nMedical Devices - Abbott\u2019s research and development programs focus on:\n\u25cf Cardiac Rhythm Management - Development of next-generation rhythm management technologies, including advanced communication capabilities and leadless pacing therapies.\n\u25cf Heart Failure - Continued enhancements to Abbott\u2019s mechanical circulatory support and pulmonary artery pressure systems, including enhanced clinical performance and usability.\n\u25cf Electrophysiology - Development of next-generation technologies in the areas of ablation, diagnostic, mapping, and visualization and recording.\n\u25cf Vascular - Development of next-generation technologies for use in coronary and peripheral vascular procedures.\n\u25cf Structural Heart - Development of minimally-invasive transcatheter and surgical devices for the repair and replacement of heart valves and other structural heart conditions.\n\u25cf Neuromodulation - Development of additional clinical evidence and next-generation technologies leveraging digital health to improve patient and physician engagement to treat chronic pain, movement disorders and other indications.\n\u25cf Diabetes Care - Develop enhancements and additional indications for the FreeStyle Libre platform of continuous glucose monitoring products to help patients improve their ability to manage diabetes and for use beyond diabetes.\nNutritionals - Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric and adult nutrition areas: gastro intestinal/immunity health, brain health, mobility and metabolism, and user experience platforms. Numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years.\nCore Laboratory Diagnostics - Abbott continues to commercialize its next-generation blood screening, immunoassay, clinical chemistry and hematology systems, along with assays, including a focus on unmet medical need, in various areas including infectious disease, cardiac care, metabolics, and oncology, as well as informatics solutions to help optimize diagnostics laboratory performance and automation solutions to increase efficiency in laboratories.\nMolecular Diagnostics - Several new molecular in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests are in various stages of development and launch.\nRapid Diagnostics - Abbott\u2019s research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for infectious disease, cardiometabolic disease and toxicology.\nIn addition, the Diagnostics Divisions are pursuing the FDA\u2019s customary regulatory process for various COVID-19 tests for which an EUA was obtained in 2020.\nGiven the diversity of Abbott\u2019s business, its intention to remain a broad-based health care company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott\u2019s total research and development expenses, as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott\u2019s overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott\u2019s 2020 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations.\nWhile the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott\u2019s ability to successfully finish each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of medical device, diagnostic and pharmaceutical products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates, and such spending is expected to approximate 7.0 percent of total Abbott sales in 2021. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period.\nGoodwill\nAt December 31, 2020, goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled $23.7 billion. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the third quarter or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs, using a quantitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The income and market approaches are used to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit. The results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value.\nFinancial Condition\nCash Flow\nNet cash from operating activities amounted to $7.9 billion, $6.1 billion and $6.3 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in Net cash from operating activities in 2020 was primarily due to the favorable cash flow impact of higher segment operating earnings, lower payments related to interest, integration expenses, and restructuring actions, and the proceeds from a litigation settlement partially offset by an increased investment in working capital and higher income tax payments. The decrease in Net cash from operating activities in 2019 was primarily due to an increased investment in working capital, timing of pension contributions relative to 2018 and higher income tax payments, partially offset by the favorable cash flow impact of improved segment operating earnings and lower interest and acquisition-related expenses.\nWhile a significant portion of Abbott\u2019s cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, are reinvested in foreign subsidiaries, Abbott does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources. Due to the enactment of the TCJA, if these funds were needed for operations in the U.S., Abbott does not expect to incur significant additional income taxes in the future to repatriate these funds.\nAbbott funded $400 million in 2020, $382 million in 2019 and $114 million in 2018 to defined benefit pension plans. Abbott expects pension funding of approximately $410 million in 2021 for its pension plans. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed Abbott\u2019s capital expenditures and cash dividends.\nDebt and Capital\nAt December 31, 2020, Abbott\u2019s long-term debt rating was A by Standard & Poor\u2019s Corporation and A3 by Moody\u2019s. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating.\nAbbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements and provide Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $5 billion on an unsecured basis. The lines of credit are part of a Five Year Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) that Abbott entered into on November 12, 2020. At that time, Abbott also terminated its 2018 revolving credit agreement. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 2018 revolving credit agreement at the time of its termination. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will mature and be payable on November 12, 2025. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest, at Abbott\u2019s option, based on either a base rate or Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott\u2019s credit ratings.\nIn 2020, financing activities related to the issuance and repayment of long-term debt included the following:\n\u25cf On June 24, 2020, Abbott completed the issuance of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $650 million of its 1.15% Notes due 2028 and $650 million of its 1.40% Notes due 2030.\n\u25cf On September 28, 2020, Abbott repaid the \u20ac1.140 billion outstanding principal amount of its 0.00% Notes due 2020 upon maturity. The repayment equated to approximately $1.3 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Abbott\u2019s total debt is $18.7 billion.\nIn 2018 and 2019, Abbott committed to reducing its debt levels which had increased as part of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere in 2017. In 2018, net repayments totaled approximately $8.3 billion of debt.\nOn February 24, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $500 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.80% Notes due 2020.\nIn September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. This bond redemption authorization superseded the board\u2019s previous authorization under which $700 million had not yet been redeemed. On December 19, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $2.850 billion outstanding principal amount of its 2.90% Notes due 2021. $2.15 billion of the 2019 $5 billion redemption authorization remains available as of December 31, 2020.\nOn November 19, 2019, Abbott\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, Abbott Ireland Financing DAC, completed a euro debt offering of \u20ac1.180 billion of long-term debt. The proceeds equated to approximately $1.3 billion. The Notes are guaranteed by Abbott.\nOn November 21, 2019, Abbott borrowed \u00a559.8 billion under a 5-year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan as a hedge of its net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The term loan bears interest at TIBOR plus a fixed spread, and the interest rate is reset quarterly. The proceeds equated to approximately $550 million.\nIn total, these 2019 transactions resulted in the repayment of approximately of $1.6 billion of debt, net of borrowings.\nIn September 2014, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of Abbott\u2019s common shares from time to time. Under the program authorized in 2014, Abbott repurchased 36.2 million shares at a cost of $1.666 billion in 2015, 10.4 million shares at a cost of $408 million in 2016, 1.9 million shares at a cost of $130 million in 2018, 6.3 million shares at a cost of $525 million in 2019, and 1.6 million shares at a cost of $173 million in 2020 for a total of approximately $2.9 billion. In October 2019, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of Abbott\u2019s common shares from time to time. The 2019 authorization is in addition to the approximately $100 million unused portion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2014.\nOn April 27, 2016, the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale for general corporate purposes of up to 75 million common shares that would result in proceeds of up to $3 billion. No shares have been issued under this authorization.\nAbbott declared dividends of $1.53 per share in 2020 compared to $1.32 per share in 2019, an increase of approximately 16 percent. Dividends paid were $2.560 billion in 2020 compared to $2.270 billion in 2019. The year-over-year change in dividends paid primarily reflects the impact of the increase in the dividend rate.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital was $8.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was due in large part to the higher level of cash and cash equivalents, which was due primarily to the increase in cash generated from operating activities, and the repayment of the current portion of long term debt after the issuance of new long term notes in 2020. Working capital also increased due to the higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory partially offset by an increase in accounts payable associated with the growth of the business.\nAbbott monitors the credit worthiness of customers and establishes an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures of $2.2 billion in 2020, $1.6 billion in 2019 and $1.4 billion in 2018 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments, investments in information technology, and laboratory instruments placed with customers. The 2020 increase in capital expenditures primarily reflects the building of capacity for the manufacture of COVID-19 diagnostics tests.\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below summarizes Abbott\u2019s estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020.\n(a) Purchase commitments are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements.\n(b) Other long-term liabilities include estimated payments for the transition tax under the TCJA, net of applicable credits.\n(c) Net unrecognized tax benefits totaling approximately $740 million are excluded from the table above as Abbott is unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities on such items. See Note 15 - Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations for further details. The company has employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other post-employment benefits, including medical and life, which have been excluded from the table. A discussion of the company\u2019s pension and post-retirement plans, including funding matters is included in Note 14 - Post-employment Benefits.\nContingent Obligations\nAbbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events.\nLegislative Issues\nAbbott\u2019s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard becomes effective for Abbott in the first quarter of 2021. Adoption of this new standard will not have a material impact on Abbott\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which allows companies to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings (Earnings employed in the business). Abbott adopted the new standard at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result of the adoption of the new standard, approximately $337 million of stranded tax effects were reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Earnings employed in the business.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires the recognition of the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets, other than inventory, in the period in which the transfer occurs. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that was not significant.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 - A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nUnder the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors.",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nFinancial Instruments and Risk Management\nMarket Price Sensitive Investments\nThe fair value of equity securities held by Abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately $20 million and $11 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2020 by approximately $4 million. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in earnings. The fair value of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan was approximately $366 million and $346 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these investments, as well as an offsetting change in the benefit obligation, are recorded in earnings.\nNon-Publicly Traded Equity Securities\nAbbott holds equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was $113 million and $158 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of $15 million. Abbott measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\nInterest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $2.9 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. The fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2020 and 2019 amounted to $22.8 billion and $20.8 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 3.3% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019) with maturities through 2046. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of current and long-term investment securities amounted to approximately $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or fair values.\nForeign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked-to-market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve to eighteen months. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Abbott held $8.1 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively, of such contracts. Contracts held at December 31, 2020 will mature in 2021 or 2022 depending upon the contract. Contracts held at December 31, 2019 matured in 2020 or will mature in 2021 depending upon the contract.\nAbbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third-party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Abbott held $11.0 billion and $9.1 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which mature in the next 13 months.\nIn November 2019, Abbott borrowed \u00a559.8 billion under a 5-year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The proceeds equated to approximately $550 million. The value of this long-term debt was approximately $577 million and $546 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.\nThe following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019:",

Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for sales rebates, income taxes, pension and other post-employment benefits, valuation of intangible assets, litigation, derivative financial instruments, and inventory and accounts receivable exposures.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - The statements of earnings of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account, which is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses are recorded on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Revenue from the launch of a new product, from an improved version of an existing product, or for shipments in excess of a customer\u2019s normal requirements are recorded when the conditions noted above are met. In those situations, management records a returns reserve for such revenue, if necessary. In certain of Abbott\u2019s businesses, primarily within diagnostics, Abbott participates in selling arrangements that include multiple performance obligations (e.g., instruments, reagents, procedures, and service agreements). The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Sales of product rights for marketable products are recorded as revenue upon disposition of the rights.\nINCOME TAXES - Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate to be in effect when the taxes are paid. No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), or any additional outside basis differences that exist, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, the TCJA subjects taxpayers to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Abbott treats the GILTI tax as a period expense and provides for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. Interest and penalties on income tax obligations are included in taxes on earnings.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE - Unvested restricted stock units and awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Earnings from Continuing Operations allocated to common shares in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $4.449 billion, $3.666 billion and $2.320 billion, respectively. Net earnings allocated to common shares in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $4.473 billion, $3.666 billion and $2.353 billion, respectively.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nPENSION AND POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS - Abbott accrues for the actuarially determined cost of pension and post-employment benefits over the service attribution periods of the employees. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over a five-year period. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS - For assets and liabilities that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, total fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs. Assets and liabilities that are measured using significant other observable inputs are valued by reference to similar assets or liabilities, adjusted for contract restrictions and other terms specific to that asset or liability. For these items, a significant portion of fair value is derived by reference to quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets. For all remaining assets and liabilities, fair value is derived using a fair value model, such as a discounted cash flow model or Black-Scholes model. Purchased intangible assets are recorded at fair value. The fair value of significant purchased intangible assets is based on independent appraisals. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION - The fair value of stock options and restricted stock awards and units are amortized over their requisite service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible, with a charge to compensation expense.\nLITIGATION - Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, \u201cContingencies.\u201d Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management\u2019s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. Legal fees are recorded as incurred.\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS - Cash equivalents consist of bank time deposits, U.S. government securities money market funds and U.S. treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less. Abbott holds certain investments with a carrying value of $277 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments held in a rabbi trust and investments in publicly traded equity securities are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. Investments in equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity, as management has both the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity, and are reported at cost, net of any unamortized premium or discount. Income relating to these securities is reported as interest income.\nTRADE RECEIVABLE VALUATIONS - Accounts receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. Accounts receivable are charged off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted.\nINVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Cost includes material and conversion costs.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following table shows estimated useful lives of property and equipment:\nPRODUCT LIABILITY - Abbott accrues for product liability claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. The liabilities are adjusted quarterly as additional information becomes available. Product liability losses are self-insured.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS - Internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved.\nACQUIRED IN-PROCESS AND COLLABORATIONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D) - The initial costs of rights to IPR&D projects obtained in an asset acquisition are expensed as IPR&D unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical or medical device products. The fair value of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completed and are then amortized over the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant.\nCONCENTRATION OF RISK AND GUARANTEES - Due to the nature of its operations, Abbott is not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers, products or geographic locations. Product warranties are not significant.\nAbbott has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements; no special purpose entities; nor activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events.\nNote 2 - New Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which allows companies to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings (Earnings employed in the business). Abbott adopted the new standard at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result of the adoption of the new standard, approximately $337 million of stranded tax effects were reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Earnings employed in the business.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 2 - New Accounting Standards (Continued)\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires the recognition of the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets, other than inventory, in the period in which the transfer occurs. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that was not significant.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nRecent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard becomes effective for Abbott in the first quarter of 2021. Adoption of this new standard will not have a material impact on Abbott\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nNote 3 - Revenue\nAbbott\u2019s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott\u2019s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott's products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians' offices and government agencies throughout the world. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 3 - Revenue (Continued)\nThe following tables provide detail by sales category:\nAbbott recognizes revenue from product sales upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. For maintenance agreements that provide service beyond Abbott\u2019s standard warranty and other service agreements, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. A time-based measure of progress appropriately reflects the transfer of services to the customer. Payment terms between Abbott and its customers vary by the type of customer, country of sale, and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and the payment due date is not significant.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 3 - Revenue (Continued)\nManagement exercises judgment in estimating variable consideration. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Abbott provides rebates to government agencies, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other private entities.\nRebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Historically, adjustments to prior years' rebate accruals have not been material to net income.\nOther allowances charged against gross sales include cash discounts and returns, which are not significant. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbott's historical returns are low, and because sales return terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Product warranties are also not significant.\nAbbott also applies judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition related to contracts that include multiple performance obligations. The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. For goods or services for which observable standalone selling prices are not available, Abbott uses an expected cost plus a margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $3.8 billion in the Diagnostic Products segment and approximately $430 million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months, approximately 17 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter.\nThese performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in ASC 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above.\nAssets Recognized for Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nAbbott has applied the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 and records as an expense the incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers in the period of occurrence when the amortization period of the asset that Abbott otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Upfront commission fees paid to sales personnel as a result of obtaining or renewing contracts with customers are incremental to obtaining the contract. Abbott capitalizes these amounts as contract costs. Capitalized commission fees are amortized based on the contract duration to which the assets relate which ranges from two to ten years. The amounts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were not significant.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 3 - Revenue (Continued)\nAdditionally, the cost of transmitters provided to customers that use Abbott\u2019s remote monitoring service with respect to certain medical devices are capitalized as contract costs. Capitalized transmitter costs are amortized based on the timing of the transfer of services to which the assets relate, which typically ranges from eight to ten years. The amounts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were not significant.\nOther Contract Assets and Liabilities\nAbbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott\u2019s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant.\nContract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott\u2019s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows:\nNote 4 - Discontinued Operations and Business Dispositions\nThe net earnings of discontinued operations include income tax benefits of $24 million in 2020 and $39 million in 2018. The 2020 tax benefits primarily relate to the resolution of various tax positions related to Abbott\u2019s developed markets branded generic pharmaceuticals business which was sold to Mylan Inc. (Mylan) in 2015. The tax positions relate to years prior to the sale to Mylan. The 2018 tax benefits primarily relate to the resolution of various tax positions related to the operations of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) for years prior to the separation. Abbott completed the separation of AbbVie, which was formed to hold Abbott\u2019s research-based proprietary pharmaceuticals business, in January 2013. Abbott retained all liabilities for all U.S. federal and foreign income taxes on income prior to the separation.\nNote 5 - Supplemental Financial Information\nOther (income) expense, net, for 2020, 2019 and 2018 includes approximately $205 million, $225 million and $160 million of income, respectively, related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 5 - Supplemental Financial Information (Continued)\nThe following summarizes the activity for 2020 related to the allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2020:\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances.\nThe detail of various balance sheet components is as follows:\nAbbott\u2019s long-term investments as of December 31, 2020 declined versus the balance as of December 31, 2019 due primarily to investment impairments totaling approximately $115 million, recorded in Other (income) expense, net within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, which was partially offset by approximately $35 million of additional investments during 2020.\nAbbott\u2019s equity securities as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, include $366 million and $346 million, respectively, of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency.\nAbbott also holds certain investments as of December 31, 2020 with a carrying value of $277 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of $113 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The $113 million carrying value is net of an approximately $60 million impairment of an investment in 2020 for which Abbott had previously recorded an unrealized gain of approximately $50 million in 2018.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 5 - Supplemental Financial Information (Continued)\nIn 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc., Abbott acquired a research & development (R&D) asset valued at $102 million, which was immediately expensed. The $102 million of expense was recorded in the R&D line of Abbott's Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\n(a) Accrued wholesaler chargeback rebates of $178 million and $175 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are netted in trade receivables because Abbott\u2019s customers are invoiced at a higher catalog price but only remit to Abbott their contract price for the products.\n(b) Includes approximately $740 million and $580 million of net unrecognized tax benefits in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 6 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe components of the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income taxes, are as follows:\n(a) (Income) loss amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges are recorded as Cost of products sold. Net actuarial losses and prior service cost is included as a component of net periodic benefit cost - see Note 14 for additional information.\nNote 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe total amount of goodwill reported was $23.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and $23.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Foreign currency translation adjustments increased goodwill by approximately $550 million in 2020 and decreased goodwill $103 million in 2019. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at December 31, 2020 was $3.0 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $3.8 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $16.6 billion for the Medical Devices segment. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2020 and 2019.\nThe gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology, was $27.8 billion and $27.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and accumulated amortization was $14.2 billion and $11.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Foreign currency translation adjustments increased intangible assets by approximately $67 million in 2020 and decreased intangible assets by $71 million in 2019. In 2020, asset impairments related to the Medical Devices segment decreased intangible assets by $148 million. The impairment was recorded in the Cost of products sold, excluding amortization of intangible assets line of Abbott\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets recorded at December 31, 2020 is approximately $2.0 billion in 2021, $2.0 billion in 2022, $1.9 billion in 2023, $1.9 billion in 2024 and $1.9 billion in 2025. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over 2 to 20 years.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets (Continued)\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to IPR&D acquired in a business combination, were approximately $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease is due to an IPR&D intangible asset related to the Medical Devices segment that became amortizable in 2020 and a $55 million impairment of an IPR&D intangible asset related to the Medical Devices segment that was recorded in the Research and development line of Abbott\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Earnings in 2020.\nNote 8 - Restructuring Plans\nFrom 2017 to 2020, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the Medical Devices segment, and Alere Inc. (Alere) into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. As of December 31, 2017, the accrued balance associated with these actions was $68 million. From 2018 to 2020, Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges totaling approximately $137 million, comprised of $13 million in 2020, $72 million in 2019 and $52 million in 2018. Approximately $30 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $15 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $92 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense over the last three years. As of December 31, 2020, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $25 million and primarily represent severance obligations.\nFrom 2016 to 2020, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $36 million in 2020, $66 million in 2019 and $28 million in 2018. Approximately $6 million in 2020, $16 million in 2019 and $10 million in 2018 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $2 million in 2020, $28 million in 2019 and $2 million in 2018 are recorded in Research and development, and approximately $28 million in 2020, $22 million in 2019 and $16 million in 2018 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense.\nThe following summarizes the activity for these restructurings:\nNote 9 - Incentive Stock Program\nThe 2017 Incentive Stock Program authorizes the granting of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance awards, foreign benefits and other share-based awards. Stock options and restricted stock awards and units comprise the majority of benefits that have been granted and are currently outstanding under this program and a prior program. In 2020, Abbott granted 4,015,420 stock options, 569,961 restricted stock awards and 5,239,575 restricted stock units under this program.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 9 - Incentive Stock Program (Continued)\nUnder Abbott\u2019s stock incentive programs, the purchase price of shares under option must be at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and the maximum term of an option is 10 years. Options generally vest equally over three years. Restricted stock awards generally vest over 3 years, with no more than one-third of the award vesting in any one year upon Abbott reaching a minimum return on equity target. Restricted stock units vest over three years and upon vesting, the recipient receives one share of Abbott stock for each vested restricted stock unit. The aggregate fair market value of options and restricted stock awards and units is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which may be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant. Restricted stock awards and settlement of vested restricted stock units are issued out of treasury shares. Abbott generally issues new shares for exercises of stock options. As a policy, Abbott does not purchase its shares relating to its share-based programs.\nIn April 2017, Abbott\u2019s shareholders authorized the 2017 Incentive Stock Program under which a maximum of 170 million shares were available for issuance. At December 31, 2020, approximately 113 million shares remained available for future issuance.\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2020.\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock awards and units activity for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe fair market value of restricted stock awards and units vested in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $631 million, $588 million and $458 million, respectively.\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $279 million, $315 million and $249 million, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to all share-based compensation plans at December 31, 2020 amounted to approximately $407 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next three years.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 9 - Incentive Stock Program (Continued)\nTotal non-cash stock compensation expense charged against income from continuing operations in 2020, 2019 and 2018 for share-based plans totaled approximately $546 million, $519 million and $477 million, respectively, and the tax benefit recognized was approximately $200 million, $197 million and $185 million, respectively. Stock compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory is not significant.\nThe table below summarizes the fair value of an option granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018 and the assumptions included in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model used to estimate the fair value:\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the rates available at the time of the grant for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the option\u2019s expected life. The average life of an option is based on both historical and projected exercise and lapsing data. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Abbott\u2019s stock and historical volatility of Abbott\u2019s stock over the expected life of the option. Dividend yield is based on the option\u2019s exercise price and annual dividend rate at the time of grant.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 10 - Debt and Lines of Credit\nThe following is a summary of long-term debt at December 31:\nOn June 24, 2020, Abbott completed the issuance of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $650 million of its 1.15% Notes due 2028 and $650 million of its 1.40% Notes due 2030.\nOn September 28, 2020, Abbott repaid the \u20ac1.140 billion outstanding principal amount of its 0.00% Notes due 2020 upon maturity. The repayment equated to approximately $1.3 billion.\nAbbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements and provide Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $5 billion on an unsecured basis. The lines of credit are part of a Five Year Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) that Abbott entered into on November 12, 2020. At that time, Abbott also terminated its 2018 revolving credit agreement. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 2018 revolving credit agreement at the time of its termination. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will mature and be payable on November 12, 2025. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest, at Abbott\u2019s option, based on either a base rate or Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott\u2019s credit ratings.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 10 - Debt and Lines of Credit (Continued)\nIn 2019, Abbott\u2019s long-term borrowings and debt issuance included the following:\n\u25cf On November 19, 2019, Abbott\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, Abbott Ireland Financing DAC, completed an offering of \u20ac1.180 billion of long-term debt consisting of \u20ac590 million of 0.10% Notes due 2024 and \u20ac590 million of 0.375% Notes due 2027. The proceeds equated to approximately $1.3 billion. The Notes are guaranteed by Abbott.\n\u25cf On November 21, 2019, Abbott borrowed \u00a559.8 billion under a 5-year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan as a hedge of its net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The term loan bears interest at TIBOR plus a fixed spread, and the interest rate is reset quarterly. The proceeds equated to approximately $550 million.\nIn 2019, Abbott\u2019s repayment of long-term debt included the following:\n\u25cf $0.500 billion outstanding principal amount of its 2.80% Notes due 2020 - redeemed on February 24, 2019\n\u25cf $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.9% Notes due 2021 - redeemed on December 19, 2019. Abbott incurred a charge of $63 million related to the early repayment of this debt.\nThe 2.80% Notes were redeemed under the board of directors\u2019 2018 bond redemption authorization discussed below. The 2.9% Notes were redeemed under a bond redemption authorization approved by the board of directors in September 2019 for the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. The 2019 bond redemption authorization superseded the board\u2019s 2018 authorization. $2.15 billion of the $5 billion authorization remans available as of December 31, 2020.\nOn January 5, 2018, Abbott repaid $2.8 billion under a 5-year term loan agreement and $1.15 billion of borrowings under its lines of credit.\nOn February 16, 2018, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. 2018 redemptions under this authorization include the following:\n\u25cf $0.947 billion principal amount of its 5.125% Notes due 2019 - redeemed on March 22, 2018\n\u25cf $1.055 billion of the $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.35% Notes due 2019 - redeemed on March 22, 2018\n\u25cf $1.300 billion of the $1.795 billion outstanding principal amount of its 2.35% Notes due 2019 - redeemed on June 22, 2018\n\u25cf $0.495 billion outstanding principal amount of its 2.35% Notes due 2019 - redeemed on September 28, 2018\nAbbott incurred a net charge of $14 million related to the March 22, 2018 early repayment of debt.\nOn September 17, 2018, Abbott repaid upon maturity the $500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2.00% Senior Notes due 2018.\nOn September 27, 2018, Abbott\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, Abbott Ireland Financing DAC, completed a euro debt offering of \u20ac3.420 billion of long-term debt consisting of \u20ac1.140 billion of non-interest bearing Senior Notes due 2020 at 99.727% of par value; \u20ac1.140 billion of 0.875% Senior Notes due 2023 at 99.912% of par value; and \u20ac1.140 billion of 1.50% Senior Notes due 2026 at 99.723% of par value. The proceeds equated to approximately $4 billion. The notes are guaranteed by Abbott.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 10 - Debt and Lines of Credit (Continued)\nOn October 28, 2018, Abbott redeemed approximately $4 billion of debt, which included $750 million principal amount of its 2.00% Notes due 2020; $597 million principal amount of its 4.125% Notes due 2020; $900 million principal amount of its 3.25% Notes due 2023; $450 million principal amount of its 3.4% Notes due 2023; and $1.300 billion principal amount of its 3.75% Notes due 2026. These amounts were in addition to the $5 billion authorization in 2018 discussed above. In conjunction with the redemption, Abbott unwound approximately $1.1 billion in interest rate swaps relating to the 3.40% Note due in 2023 and the 3.75% Note due in 2026. Abbott incurred a net charge of $153 million related to the early repayment of this debt and the unwinding of related interest rate swaps.\nPrincipal payments required on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 are $7 million in 2021, $753 million in 2022, $2.4 billion in 2023, $1.3 billion in 2024, $1.5 billion in 2025 and $12.5 billion in 2026 and thereafter.\nAt December 31, 2020, Abbott\u2019s long-term debt rating was A by Standard & Poor\u2019s Corporation and A3 by Moody\u2019s. Abbott\u2019s weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings was 0.4%at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nNote 11 - Leases\nLeases where Abbott is the Lessee\nAbbott has entered into operating leases as the lessee for office space, manufacturing facilities, R&D laboratories, warehouses, vehicles and equipment. Finance leases are not significant. Abbott\u2019s operating leases generally have remaining lease terms of 1 to 10 years. Some leases include options to extend beyond the original lease term, generally up to 10 years and some include options to terminate early. These options have been included in the determination of the lease liability when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\nFor all of its asset classes, Abbott elected the practical expedient allowed under FASB ASC No. 842, \u201cLeases\u201d to account for each lease component (e.g., the right to use office space) and the associated non-lease components (e.g., maintenance services) as a single lease component. Abbott also elected the short-term lease accounting policy for all asset classes; therefore, Abbott is not recognizing a lease liability or right of use (ROU) asset for any lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that Abbott is reasonably certain to exercise.\nAs Abbott\u2019s leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the interest rate used to determine the present value of the payments under each lease typically reflects Abbott\u2019s incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date. Abbott\u2019s incremental borrowing rates at January 1, 2019 were used for operating leases that commenced prior to January 1, 2019 when ASC 842 was adopted.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 11 - Leases (Continued)\nThe following table provides information related to Abbott\u2019s operating leases:\n(a) Includes short-term lease expense and variable lease costs, which were immaterial in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nFuture minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nThe following table summarizes the amounts and location of operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities:\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 11 - Leases (Continued)\nLeases where Abbott is the Lessor\nCertain assets, primarily diagnostics instruments, are leased to customers under contractual arrangements that typically include an operating or sales-type lease as well as performance obligations for reagents and other consumables. Sales-type leases are not significant. Contract terms vary by customer and may include options to terminate the contract or options to extend the contract. Where instruments are provided under operating lease arrangements, some portion or the entire lease revenue may be variable and subject to subsequent non-lease component (e.g., reagent) sales. The allocation of revenue between the lease and non-lease components is based on stand-alone selling prices. Operating lease revenue represented less than 3 percent of Abbott\u2019s total net sales in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nAssets related to operating leases are reported within Net property and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The original cost and the net book value of such assets were $3.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and $2.8 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.\nNote 12 - Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures\nCertain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $8.1 billion at December 31, 2020, and $6.8 billion at December 31, 2019, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2020 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months.\nAbbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Abbott held gross notional amounts of $11.0 billion and $9.1 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts.\nIn November 2019, Abbott borrowed \u00a559.8 billion under a 5-year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The proceeds equated to approximately $550 million. The value of this long-term debt was approximately $577 million and $546 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.\nAbbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $2.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.\nIn October 2018, Abbott unwound approximately $1.1 billion in interest rate swaps relating to the 3.40% Note due in 2023 and the 3.75% Note due in 2026. As a part of the unwinding, Abbott paid approximately $90 million in cash, which was included in the Financing Activities section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in 2018.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 12 - Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of December 31:\nThe following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges, debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income.\nA loss of $171 million, a gain of $75 million and a loss of $100 million were recognized in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as hedges. These amounts are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line.\nThe interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The hedged debt is marked to market, offsetting the effect of marking the interest rate swaps to market.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 12 - Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued)\nThe carrying values and fair values of certain financial instruments as of December 31 are shown in the table below. The carrying values of all other financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values. The counterparties to financial instruments consist of select major international financial institutions. Abbott does not expect any losses from nonperformance by these counterparties.\nThe fair value of the debt was determined based on significant other observable inputs, including current interest rates.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 12 - Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the bases used to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance sheet:\nThe fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts is determined using a market approach, which utilizes values for comparable derivative instruments. The fair value of the debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs.\nContingent consideration relates to businesses acquired by Abbott. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on an independent appraisal adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. The maximum amount for certain contingent consideration is not determinable as it is based on a percent of certain sales. Excluding such contingent consideration, the maximum amount estimated to be due is approximately $200 million, which is dependent upon attaining certain sales thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events, such as regulatory approvals.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 13 - Litigation and Environmental Matters\nAbbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $10 million.\nAbbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $90 million to $120 million. The recorded accrual balance at December 31, 2020 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $105 million. This accrual represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, \u201cContingencies.\u201d Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott\u2019s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.\nNote 14 - Post-Employment Benefits\nRetirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution and medical and dental plans. Information for Abbott\u2019s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows:\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 14 - Post-Employment Benefits (Continued)\nThe $1.3 billion and $1.9 billion of defined benefit plan losses in 2020 and 2019, respectively, that increased the projected benefit obligations in those years, primarily reflect the year-over-year decline in the discount rates used to measure the obligations. The projected benefit obligations for non-U.S. defined benefit plans were $4.1 billion and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligations for all defined benefit plans were $11.9 billion and $10.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor plans where the projected benefit obligations exceeded plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the projected benefit obligations and the aggregate plan assets were as follows:\nFor plans where the accumulated benefit obligations exceeded plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate accumulated benefit obligations, the projected benefit obligations and the aggregate plan assets were as follows:\nThe components of the net periodic benefit cost were as follows:\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for each respective year includes the amortization of actuarial losses and prior service costs (credits) as noted in the previous table. Other comprehensive income (loss) for each respective year also includes: net actuarial losses of $611 million for defined benefit plans and a gain of $23 million for medical and dental plans in 2020, net actuarial losses of $944 million for defined benefit plans and a loss of $190 million for medical and dental plans in 2019; net actuarial losses of $86 million for defined benefit plans and a gain of $53 million for medical and dental plans in 2018. The net actuarial losses in 2020 and 2019 are primarily due to the year-over-year decline in discount rates partially offset by the impact of actual asset returns in excess of expected returns in each of the period.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 14 - Post-Employment Benefits (Continued)\nThe weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans are as follows:\nThe weighted average assumptions used to determine the net cost for defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans are as follows:\nThe assumed health care cost trend rates for medical and dental plans at December 31 were as follows:\nThe discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high-quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbott\u2019s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are forward projections of health care costs as of the measurement date.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 14 - Post-Employment Benefits (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the bases used to measure the defined benefit and medical and dental plan assets at fair value:\n(a) A mix of index funds and actively managed equity accounts that are benchmarked to various large cap indices.\n(b) A mix of index funds and actively managed equity accounts that are benchmarked to various mid and small cap indices.\n(c) A mix of index funds and actively managed pooled investment funds that are benchmarked to various non-U.S. equity indices in both developed and emerging markets.\n(d) A mix of index funds and actively managed accounts that are benchmarked to various U.S. government bond indices.\n(e) A mix of index funds and actively managed accounts that are benchmarked to various corporate bond indices.\n(f) Primarily United Kingdom, Japan and Eurozone government bonds.\n(g) Primarily asset backed securities and an actively managed, diversified fixed income vehicle benchmarked to the one-month Libor / Euribor.\n(h) Primarily funds invested by managers that have a global mandate with the flexibility to allocate capital broadly across a wide range of asset classes and strategies including, but not limited to equities, fixed income, commodities, interest rate futures, currencies and other securities to outperform an agreed upon benchmark with specific return and volatility targets.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 14 - Post-Employment Benefits (Continued)\n(i) Primarily investments in private funds, such as private equity, private credit, private real estate and private energy funds.\n(j) Investments measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheet.\nEquities that are valued using quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Equities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. For approximately half of these funds, investments may be redeemed once per month, with a required 7 to 30 day notice period. For the remaining funds, daily redemption of an investment is allowed. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at prices obtained from independent financial service industry recognized vendors. Abbott did not have any unfunded commitments related to fixed income funds at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Fixed income securities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. For the majority of these funds, investments may be redeemed either weekly or monthly, with a required 2 to 14 day notice period. For the remaining funds, investments may be generally redeemed daily.\nAbsolute return funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. All private funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund on a one-quarter lag adjusted for known cash flows and significant events through the reporting date. Abbott did not have any unfunded commitments related to absolute return funds at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Investments in these funds may be generally redeemed monthly or quarterly with required notice periods ranging from 5 to 90 days. For approximately $245 million and $110 million of the absolute return funds, redemptions are subject to a 33 percent gate and a 25 percent gate, respectively, and $60 million is subject to a lock until 2022. Investments in the private funds cannot be redeemed but the funds will make distributions through liquidation. The estimate of the liquidation period for each fund ranges from 2021 to 2030. Abbott\u2019s unfunded commitment in these funds was $523 million and $579 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, as well as balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities with lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes, and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The plans do not directly hold any securities of Abbott. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plans\u2019 assets. Abbott\u2019s medical and dental plans\u2019 assets are invested in a similar mix as the pension plan assets. The actual asset allocation percentages at year end are consistent with the company\u2019s targeted asset allocation percentages.\nThe plans\u2019 expected return on assets, as shown above is based on management\u2019s expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions.\nAbbott funds its domestic pension plans according to IRS funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. Abbott funded $400 million in 2020 and $382 million in 2019 to defined pension plans. Abbott expects to contribute approximately $410 million to its pension plans in 2021.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 14 - Post-Employment Benefits (Continued)\nTotal benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which includes payments funded from company assets, as well as paid from the plans, are as follows:\nThe Abbott Stock Retirement Plan is the principal defined contribution plan. Abbott\u2019s contributions to this plan were $164 million in 2020, $158 million in 2019 and $146 million in 2018. The 2018 contributions include amounts related to participants of the St. Jude Medical Retirement Plan which was terminated in January 2018.\nNote 15 - Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations\nTaxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the annual effective rates, including charges for interest and penalties. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts.\nIn 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the recognition of approximately $170 million of tax benefits associated with the impairment of certain assets, approximately $140 million of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years, and approximately $100 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include a $26 million increase to the transition tax associated with the 2017 TCJA. The $26 million increase to the transition tax liability was the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. This adjustment increased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $1.53 billion. The one-time transition tax is based on Abbott\u2019s total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The tax computation also requires the determination of the amount of post-1986 E&P considered held in cash and other specified assets. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining balance of Abbott\u2019s transition tax obligation is approximately $805 million, which will be paid over the next six years as allowed by the TCJA.\nIn 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included an $86 million reduction of the transition tax and $68 million of tax expense resulting from tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2019 in India. The $86 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in 2019. In 2018, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included $98 million of net tax expense related to the settlement of Abbott\u2019s 2014-2016 federal income tax audit in the U.S., partial settlement of the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group\u2019s 2014 and 2015 federal income tax returns in the U.S. and audit settlements in various countries. In 2018, Abbott also recorded $130 million of additional tax expense related to the TCJA; the $130 million reflected a $120 million increase in the transition tax from $2.89 billion to $3.01 billion and a $10 million reduction in the net benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nUndistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable. In the U.S., Abbott\u2019s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled. There are numerous other income tax jurisdictions for which tax returns are not yet settled, none of which are individually significant. Reserves for interest and penalties are not significant.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 15 - Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations (Continued)\nEarnings from continuing operations before taxes, and the related provisions for taxes on earnings from continuing operations, were as follows:\nDifferences between the effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory tax rate were as follows:\nImpact of foreign operations is primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Singapore, and Malta.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 15 - Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations (Continued)\nThe tax effect of the differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nAbbott has incurred losses in a foreign jurisdiction where realization of the future economic benefit is so remote that the benefit is not reflected as a deferred tax asset.\nThe following table summarizes the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits without regard to reduction in tax liabilities or additions to deferred tax assets and liabilities if such unrecognized tax benefits were settled:\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is approximately $1.08 billion. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease within a range of $70 million to $430 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 16 - Segment and Geographic Area Information\nAbbott\u2019s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products. Abbott\u2019s products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians\u2019 offices and government agencies throughout the world.\nAbbott\u2019s reportable segments are as follows:\nEstablished Pharmaceutical Products-International sales of a broad line of branded generic pharmaceutical products.\nNutritional Products-Worldwide sales of a broad line of adult and pediatric nutritional products.\nDiagnostic Products-Worldwide sales of diagnostic systems and tests for blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories and alternate-care testing sites. For segment reporting purposes, the Core Laboratories Diagnostics, Rapid Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care divisions are aggregated and reported as the Diagnostic Products segment.\nMedical Devices - Worldwide sales of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular, structural heart, neuromodulation and diabetes care products. For segment reporting purposes, the Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology and Heart Failure, Vascular, Neuromodulation, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care divisions are aggregated and reported as the Medical Devices segment.\nAbbott's underlying accounting records are maintained on a legal entity basis for government and public reporting requirements. Segment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with internal management reporting. The cost of some corporate functions and the cost of certain employee benefits are charged to segments at predetermined rates that approximate cost. Remaining costs, if any, are not allocated to segments. In addition, intangible asset amortization is not allocated to operating segments, and intangible assets and goodwill are not included in the measure of each segment\u2019s assets.\nThe following segment information has been prepared in accordance with the internal accounting policies of Abbott, as described above, and are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied to the consolidated financial statements.\n(a) Net sales and operating earnings were unfavorably affected by the impact of foreign exchange in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 16 - Segment and Geographic Area Information (Continued)\n(b) Other, net includes integration costs associated with the acquisition of St. Jude Medical and Alere and restructuring charges in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Other, net in 2020 also includes costs related to asset impairments, partially offset by income from the settlement of litigation. Other, net in 2018 also includes inventory step-up amortization associated with the acquisition of Alere. Charges for restructuring actions and other cost reduction initiatives were approximately $125 million in 2020, $215 million in 2019 and $153 million in 2018.\nAbbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 16 - Segment and Geographic Area Information (Continued)\n(c)Sales by country are based on the country that sold the product.\nLong-lived assets on a geographic basis primarily include property and equipment. It excludes goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets, and financial instruments. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, long-lived assets totaled $11.7 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively, and in the United States such assets totaled $6.1 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. Long-lived asset balances associated with other countries were not material on an individual country basis in either of the two years.\nManagement Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of Abbott Laboratories is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Abbott\u2019s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company\u2019s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nAbbott\u2019s management assessed the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2020, the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nAbbott\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on their assessment of the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page 84.\nRobert B. Ford\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nRobert E. Funck, Jr.\nExecutive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer\nPhilip P. Boudreau\nVice President, Finance and Controller\nFebruary 19, 2021\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders\u2019 investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nIncome taxes - Unrecognized tax benefits\nDescription of the\nMatter\nAs described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020. Unrecognized tax benefits are assessed by management quarterly for identification and measurement, or more frequently if there are any indicators suggesting change in unrecognized tax benefits. Assessing tax positions involves judgement including interpreting tax laws of multiple jurisdictions and assumptions relevant to the measurement of an unrecognized tax benefit, including the estimated amount of tax liability that may be incurred should the tax position not be sustained upon inspection by a tax authority. These judgements and assumptions can significantly affect unrecognized tax benefits.\nHow We Addressed\nthe Matter in our\nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company\u2019s identification and measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, as well as its process for the assessment of events that may indicate a change in unrecognized tax benefits is warranted. For example, we tested controls over management\u2019s review of the completeness of identified unrecognized tax benefits, as well as controls over management\u2019s review of significant assumptions used within the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits.\nWith the support of our tax professionals, among other audit procedures performed, we evaluated the reasonableness of management\u2019s judgement with respect to the interpretation of tax laws of multiple jurisdictions by reading and evaluating management\u2019s documentation, including relevant accounting policies, and by considering how tax law, including statutes, regulations and case law, affected management\u2019s judgments. We tested the completeness of management\u2019s assessment of the identification of unrecognized tax benefits and possible outcomes related to it including evaluation of technical merits of the unrecognized tax benefits. We also tested, with the support of our valuation specialists, appropriateness and consistency of management\u2019s methods and significant assumptions associated with the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, including assessing the estimated amount of tax liability that may be incurred should the tax position not be sustained upon inspection by a tax authority.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2013.\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 19, 2021\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders' investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated February 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 19, 2021",

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\n(a) Equity Compensation Plan Information.\nThe following table presents information as of December 31, 2020 about our compensation plans under which Abbott common shares have been authorized for issuance.\n(1)\n(i)\nAbbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program. Benefits under the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program (the \u201c2009 Program\u201d) include non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, other share-based awards (including stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents and recognition awards), awards to non-employee directors, and foreign benefits. The shares that remain available for issuance under the 2009 Program may be issued in connection with any one of these benefits and may be either authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares (except that restricted stock awards are satisfied from treasury shares).\nIf there is a lapse, expiration, termination, forfeiture or cancellation of any benefit granted under the 2009 Program without the issuance of shares or payment of cash thereunder, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program (the \u201c2017 Program\u201d). If shares are issued under any benefit under the 2009 Program and thereafter are reacquired by Abbott pursuant to rights reserved upon their issuance, or pursuant to the payment of the purchase price of shares under stock options by delivery of other common shares of Abbott, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may not again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2009 Program.\nIn April 2017, the 2009 Program was replaced by the 2017 Program. No further awards will be granted under the 2009 Program.\n(ii)\nAbbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program. Benefits under the 2017 Program include non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, other share-based awards (including stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents and recognition awards), awards to non-employee directors, and foreign benefits. The shares that remain available for issuance under the 2017 Program may be issued in connection with any one of these benefits and may be either authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares (except that restricted stock awards are satisfied from treasury shares).\nIf there is a lapse, expiration, termination, forfeiture or cancellation of any benefit granted under the 2017 Program without the issuance of shares or payment of cash thereunder, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2017 Program. If shares are issued under any benefit under the 2017 Program and thereafter are reacquired by Abbott pursuant to rights reserved upon their issuance, or pursuant to the payment of the purchase price of shares under stock options by delivery of other common shares of Abbott, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may not again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2017 Program.\n(iii)\nAbbott Laboratories Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees. Eligible employees of participating non-U.S. affiliates of Abbott may participate in this plan. An eligible employee may authorize payroll deductions at the rate of 1% to 10% of eligible compensation (in multiples of one percent) subject to a limit of US $12,500 during any purchase cycle.\nPurchase cycles are generally six months long and usually begin on August 1 and February 1. On the last day of each purchase cycle, Abbott uses participant contributions to acquire Abbott common shares. The shares may be either authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares, or shares acquired on the open market. The purchase price is typically 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the shares on the purchase date or on the first day of that purchase cycle. As the number of shares subject to outstanding options is indeterminable, columns (a) and (b) of the above table do not include information on the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2020, an aggregate of 11,611,818 common shares were available for future issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, including shares subject to purchase during the current purchase cycle.\nIn April 2017, the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees was amended and restated as the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees.\n(2)\nNot included in the table: St. Jude Medical, Inc. Plans. In 2017, in connection with the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Inc., options outstanding under the St. Jude Medical, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated (2014) were assumed by Abbott and converted into Abbott options of substantially equivalent value.
