    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nAlexander\u2019s, Inc. (NYSE: ALX) is a real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) incorporated in Delaware, engaged in leasing, managing, developing and redeveloping its properties. All references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cCompany\u201d and \u201cAlexander\u2019s\u201d refer to Alexander\u2019s, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We are managed by, and our properties are leased and developed by, Vornado Realty Trust (\u201cVornado\u201d) (NYSE: VNO).\nWe have seven properties in the greater New York City metropolitan area consisting of:\nOperating properties\n\u2022731 Lexington Avenue, a 1,323,000 square foot multi-use building, comprising the entire block bounded by Lexington Avenue, East 59th Street, Third Avenue and East 58th Street in Manhattan. The building contains 920,000 and 155,000 of net rentable square feet of office and retail space, respectively, which we own, and 248,000 square feet of residential space consisting of 105 condominium units, which we sold. Bloomberg L.P. (\u201cBloomberg\u201d) occupies all of the office space. The Home Depot (83,000 square feet) is the principal retail tenant;\n\u2022Rego Park I, a 338,000 square foot shopping center, located on Queens Boulevard and 63rd Road in Queens. The center is anchored by a 112,000 square foot IKEA, a 50,000 square foot Burlington, a 46,000 square foot Bed Bath & Beyond and a 36,000 square foot Marshalls;\n\u2022Rego Park II, a 609,000 square foot shopping center, adjacent to the Rego Park I shopping center in Queens. The center is anchored by a 145,000 square foot Costco and a 133,000 square foot Kohl\u2019s, which has been subleased. On September 10, 2020, Century 21 ($6,400,000 of annual revenue) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed its 135,000 square foot store on December 7, 2020;\n\u2022The Alexander apartment tower, located above our Rego Park II shopping center, contains 312 units aggregating 255,000 square feet;\n\u2022Paramus, located at the intersection of Routes 4 and 17 in Paramus, New Jersey, consists of 30.3 acres of land that is ground leased to IKEA; and\n\u2022Flushing, a 167,000 square foot building, located on Roosevelt Avenue and Main Street in Queens, that is sub-leased to New World Mall LLC for the remainder of our ground lease term.\nProperty to be developed\n\u2022Rego Park III, a 140,000 square foot land parcel adjacent to the Rego Park II shopping center in Queens, at the intersection of Junction Boulevard and the Horace Harding Service Road.\nRelationship with Vornado\nWe are managed by, and our properties are leased and developed by, Vornado, pursuant to various agreements which expire in March of each year and are automatically renewable. Vornado is a fully-integrated REIT with significant experience in managing, leasing, developing, and operating office and retail properties.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Vornado owned 32.4% of our outstanding common stock. Steven Roth is the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, the Managing General Partner of Interstate Properties (\u201cInterstate\u201d), a New Jersey general partnership, and the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado. As of December 31, 2020, Mr. Roth, Interstate and its other two general partners, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. (who are also directors of the Company and trustees of Vornado) owned, in the aggregate, 26.1% of our outstanding common stock, in addition to the 2.3% they indirectly own through Vornado. Matthew Iocco, our Chief Financial Officer, is the Executive Vice President - Chief Accounting Officer of Vornado.\nSignificant Tenant\nBloomberg accounted for revenue of $109,066,000, $109,113,000 and $107,356,000 in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, representing approximately 55%, 48% and 46% of our total revenues in each year, respectively. No other tenant accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. If we were to lose Bloomberg as a tenant, or if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its obligations under its lease, it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In order to assist us in our continuing assessment of Bloomberg\u2019s creditworthiness, we receive certain confidential financial information and metrics from Bloomberg. In addition, we access and evaluate financial information regarding Bloomberg from other private sources, as well as publicly available data.\nCompetition\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. All of our properties are located in the greater New York City metropolitan area. We compete with a large number of real estate investors, property owners and developers. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, the availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends, zoning laws, and our ability to lease, sublease or sell our properties, at profitable levels. Our success is also subject to our ability to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms as it comes due.\nHuman Capital Resources\nSince we are externally managed by Vornado, we do not have separate employees that provide management, leasing and development services. We currently have 70 property-level employees who provide cleaning, engineering and security services. Our employees are managed by Vornado in accordance with its employee policies and they have access to Vornado\u2019s benefits, training and other programs.\nExecutive Office\nOur executive office is located at 210 Route 4 East, Paramus, New Jersey, 07652 and our telephone number is (201) 587-8541.\nAvailable Information\nCopies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, as well as Reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5 regarding officers, directors, and 10% beneficial owners filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a), 15(d) or 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are available free of charge on our website (www.alx-inc.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). Also available on our website are copies of our Audit Committee Charter, Compensation Committee Charter, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines. In the event of any changes to these items, revised copies will be made available on our website. Copies of these documents are also available directly from us, free of charge.\nIn May 2009, Vornado and Interstate each filed with the SEC an amendment to their respective Schedule 13D indicating that they, as a group, own 47.2% of our common stock. This ownership level, together with the shares owned by Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight, makes us a \u201ccontrolled\u201d company for the purposes of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.\u2019s Corporate Governance Standards (the \u201cNYSE Rules\u201d). This means that we are not required to, among other things, have a majority of the members of our Board of Directors be independent under the NYSE Rules, have all of the members of our Compensation Committee be independent under the NYSE Rules or to have a Nominating Committee. While we have voluntarily complied with a majority of the independence requirements of the NYSE Rules, we are under no obligation to do so and this situation may change at any time.",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nMaterial factors that may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition are summarized below. The risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d contained herein on page 4.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR PROPERTIES AND INDUSTRY\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and the impact could be material to us.\nOur business has been adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, our \u201cnon-essential\u201d retail tenants were ordered to temporarily close and although substantially all re-opened in the latter part of June 2020, there are limitations on occupancy and other restrictions that affect their ability to resume full operations and impact their financial health. In limited circumstances, we have agreed to and may continue to agree to rent deferrals and abatements for certain of our tenants.\nNumerous Federal, state, local and industry-initiated efforts may also affect our ability to collect rent or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent. Certain of our tenants may incur significant costs or losses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and/or incur other liabilities related to shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, infection or other related factors. Tenants that experience deteriorating financial conditions may be unwilling or unable to pay rent on a timely basis, or at all. Specifically, on September 10, 2020, Century 21, which leased 135,000 square feet at our Rego Park II shopping center, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed its store on December 7, 2020.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also caused, and is likely to continue to cause, severe economic, market or other disruptions worldwide. Conditions in the bank lending, capital and other financial markets may deteriorate as a result of the pandemic, our access to capital and other sources of funding may become constrained and the ratios of our debt to asset values may deteriorate, which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings. In addition, the deterioration of global, national, regional and local economic conditions as a result of the pandemic may ultimately decrease occupancy and/or rent levels across our portfolio as tenants reduce or defer their spending, which may result in less cash flow available for operating costs, to pay our indebtedness and for distribution to our stockholders and the impact could be material. In addition, the value of our real estate assets may decline, which may result in non-cash impairment charges in future periods and the impact could be material. The extent of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the outbreak and governmental responses thereto, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. Due to the speed with which the situation is developing, we are not able at this time to estimate the ultimate effect of these factors on our business, but the adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be material.\nAll of our properties are in the greater New York City metropolitan area and are affected by the economic cycles and risks inherent in that area.\nAll of our revenues come from properties located in the greater New York City metropolitan area. Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in either the short or long term. Recent declines in the economy and declines in the real estate market in this area, have hurt and could continue to hurt, our financial performance and the value of our properties. In addition to the factors affecting the national economic condition generally, the factors affecting economic conditions in this area include:\n\u2022financial performance and productivity of the media, advertising, professional services, financial, technology, retail, insurance and real estate industries;\n\u2022the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022business layoffs or downsizing;\n\u2022industry slowdowns;\n\u2022relocations of businesses;\n\u2022changing demographics;\n\u2022increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;\n\u2022changes in the number of domestic and international tourists to our markets (including as a result of changes in the relative strengths of world currencies);\n\u2022infrastructure quality;\n\u2022changes in the rates or treatment of the deductibility of state and local taxes; and\n\u2022any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate.\nIt is impossible for us to predict the future or the effect of trends in the economic and investment climates of the greater New York City metropolitan region, and more generally of the United States, on the real estate market in this area. Local, national or global economic downturns could negatively affect our business and profitability.\nWe may be adversely affected by trends in office real estate.\nWork from home, flexible work schedules, open workplaces and teleconferencing are becoming more common and are expected to accelerate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These practices may enable businesses to reduce their office space requirements. There is also an increasing trend among some businesses to utilize shared office spaces and co-working spaces. A continuation of these trends could, over time, erode the overall demand for office space and, in turn, place downward pressure on occupancy, rental rates and property valuations.\nWe are subject to risks that affect the general and New York City retail environments.\nCertain of our properties are New York City retail properties. As such, these properties are affected by the general and New York City retail environments, including the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, New York City tourism, the threat of terrorism, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing competition from on-line retailers, other retailers and outlet malls and the impact of technological change upon the retail environment generally. For a number of our tenants that operate retail businesses involving high contact interactions with their customers, the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business has been particularly severe and the recovery more difficult, with customer traffic down significantly. Furthermore, it is unknowable whether consumers\u2019 retail habits will return to norms that existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants, or result in the bankruptcy of such tenants, and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our retail locations, which could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nTerrorist attacks may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.\nAll of our properties are located in the greater New York City metropolitan area, and our most significant property, 731 Lexington Avenue, is located on Lexington Avenue and 59th Street in Manhattan. In response to a terrorist attack or the perceived threat of terrorism, tenants in this area may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in this area. This, in turn, could trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these markets, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease our properties on less favorable terms. Furthermore, we may experience increased costs for security, equipment and personnel. As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues could decline materially.\nNatural disasters and the effects of climate change could have a concentrated impact on the area which we operate and could adversely impact our results.\nOur investments are in the greater New York City metropolitan area and since they are concentrated along the Eastern Seaboard, natural disasters, including hurricanes, could cause significant damage to our properties and the surrounding environment or area. Potentially adverse consequences of \u201cglobal warming,\u201d including rising sea levels, could similarly have an impact on our properties and the economy of the greater New York City metropolitan area in which we operate. Government efforts to combat climate change may impact the cost of operating our properties and real estate in the New York City metropolitan area. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for office space in our buildings or the inability of us to operate the buildings at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy at our properties and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our properties against such risks. The incurrence of these losses, costs or business interruptions may adversely affect our operating and financial results.\nOur performance and the value of an investment in us are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.\nThe value of our real estate and the value of an investment in us fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business. These conditions may also adversely impact our revenues and cash flows.\nThe factors that affect the value of our real estate include, among other things:\n\u2022global, national, regional and local economic conditions;\n\u2022the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022competition from other available space;\n\u2022local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area;\n\u2022how well we manage our properties;\n\u2022the development and/or redevelopment of our properties;\n\u2022changes in market rental rates;\n\u2022the timing and costs associated with property improvements and rentals;\n\u2022whether we are able to pass all or portions of any increases in operating costs through to tenants;\n\u2022political and regulatory conditions;\n\u2022changes in real estate taxes and other expenses;\n\u2022the ability of state and local governments to operate within their budgets;\n\u2022whether tenants and users such as customers and shoppers consider a property attractive;\n\u2022changes in consumer preferences adversely affecting retailers and retail store values;\n\u2022changes in space utilization by our tenants due to technology, economic conditions and business environment;\n\u2022the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;\n\u2022consequences of any armed conflict involving, or terrorist attack against, the United States or individual acts of violence in public spaces;\n\u2022trends in office real estate;\n\u2022the impact on our retail tenants and demand for retail space at our properties due to increased competition from online shopping;\n\u2022availability of financing on acceptable terms or at all;\n\u2022inflation or deflation;\n\u2022fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u2022our ability to obtain adequate insurance;\n\u2022changes in zoning laws and taxation;\n\u2022government regulation;\n\u2022potential liability under environmental or other laws or regulations;\n\u2022natural disasters;\n\u2022general competitive factors; and\n\u2022climate changes.\nThe rents we receive and the occupancy levels at our properties may decline as a result of adverse changes in any of these factors. If our rental revenues and/or occupancy levels decline, we generally would expect to have less cash available for operating costs, to pay our indebtedness and for distribution to our stockholders. In addition, some of our major expenses, including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs generally do not decline when the related rents decline.\nReal estate is a competitive business and that competition may adversely impact us.\nWe compete with a large number of real estate investors, property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market, which may adversely impact the rents we can charge at those properties and our results of operations.\nWe depend on leasing space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from tenants who may not be able to pay.\nOur financial results depend significantly on leasing space in our properties to tenants on economically favorable terms. In addition, because a majority of our income is derived from renting real property, our income, funds available to pay indebtedness and for distributions to stockholders will decrease if certain of our tenants cannot pay their rent or if we are not able to maintain our occupancy levels on favorable terms. If a tenant does not pay its rent, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and might incur substantial legal and other costs. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Federal, state and local regulations and economic conditions have affected our ability to collect rent or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent. Even if we are able to enforce our rights, a tenant may not have recoverable assets. Additionally, in limited circumstances, we have agreed and may continue to agree to rent deferrals and abatements for certain of our tenants.\nBankruptcy or insolvency of tenants may decrease our revenues, net income and available cash.\nFrom time to time, some of our tenants have declared bankruptcy, and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future. On September 10, 2020, Century 21, which leased 135,000 square feet at our Rego Park II shopping center ($6,400,000 of annual revenue), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed its store on December 7, 2020. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could cause us to suffer lower revenues and operational difficulties, including leasing the remainder of the property. As a result, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant or multiple tenants could result in decreased revenues, net income and funds available to pay our indebtedness or make distributions to stockholders.\nWe depend upon anchor tenants to attract shoppers at our Rego Park I and II retail properties and decisions made by these tenants, or adverse developments in the businesses of these tenants, could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Rego Park I and II retail properties are anchored by well-known department stores and other tenants who generate shopping traffic. The value of these properties would be adversely affected if our anchor tenants failed to meet their contractual obligations, sought concessions in order to continue operations or ceased their operations, including as a result of bankruptcy. If the level of sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to economic conditions, increased competition from online shopping, closing of anchors or for other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event of a default by a tenant or anchor, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord. Additionally, closure of an anchor or major tenant could result in lease terminations by, or reductions of rent from, other tenants if the other tenants\u2019 leases have co-tenancy clauses. On September 10, 2020, Century 21, which leased 135,000 square feet at our Rego Park II shopping center ($6,400,000 of annual revenue), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed its store on December 7, 2020.\nWe may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire.\nWhen our tenants decide not to renew their leases upon their expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if tenants do renew or we can relet the space, the terms of renewal or reletting, considering among other things, the cost of improvements to the property and leasing commissions, may be less favorable than the terms in the expired leases. In addition, changes in space utilization by our tenants may impact our ability to renew or relet space without the need to incur substantial costs in renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of the relevant property. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space at similar rates or if we incur substantial costs in renewing or reletting the space, our cash flow and ability to service debt obligations and pay dividends and distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected.\n731 Lexington Avenue accounts for a substantial portion of our revenues. Loss of or damage to the building would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n731 Lexington Avenue accounted for revenue of $137,718,000, $153,797,000 and $151,834,000 in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, representing approximately 69%, 68% and 65% of our total revenues in each year, respectively. Loss of or damage to the building in excess of our insurance coverage, including as a result of a terrorist attack, would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nBloomberg represents a significant portion of our revenues. Loss of Bloomberg as a tenant or deterioration in Bloomberg\u2019s credit quality could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nBloomberg accounted for revenue of $109,066,000, $109,113,000 and $107,356,000 in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, representing approximately 55%, 48% and 46% of our total revenues in each year, respectively. No other tenant accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. If we were to lose Bloomberg as a tenant, or if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its obligations under its lease, it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIES\nWe may acquire, develop, or redevelop properties and this may create risks.\nAlthough our stated business strategy is not to engage in acquisitions, we may acquire, develop or redevelop properties when we believe that an acquisition, development or redevelopment project is otherwise consistent with our business strategy. We may not succeed in (i) developing, redeveloping or acquiring properties; (ii) completing these activities on time or within budget; and (iii) leasing or selling developed, redeveloped or acquired properties at amounts sufficient to cover our costs. Competition in these activities could also significantly increase our costs. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention. Acquisitions, developments or redevelopments in new markets or types of properties where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in weaker than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition, development or redevelopment opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred. Furthermore, we may be exposed to the liabilities of properties acquired, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with property redevelopment and repositioning that could adversely affect us, including our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continue to engage in redevelopment and repositioning activities with respect to our properties, and, accordingly, we are subject to certain risks, which could adversely affect us, including our financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, without limitation, (i) the availability and pricing of financing on favorable terms or at all; (ii) the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory approvals; (iii) the potential for the fluctuation of occupancy rates and rents at redeveloped properties, which may result in our investment not being profitable; (iv) start up, repositioning and redevelopment costs may be higher than anticipated; (v) cost overruns and untimely completion of construction (including risks beyond our control, such as weather or labor conditions, or material shortages); (vi) the potential that we may fail to recover expenses already incurred if we abandon development or redevelopment opportunities after we begin to explore them; (vii) the potential that we may expend funds on and devote management time to projects which we do not complete; (viii) the inability to lease a property on schedule or at all, resulting in increased construction or redevelopment costs; and (ix) the possibility that properties will be leased at below expected rental rates. These risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and could prevent the initiation or the completion of redevelopment activities, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the market value of our common shares and ability to satisfy our principal and interest obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders.\nIt may be difficult to sell real estate timely, which may limit our flexibility.\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid. Consequently, we may have limited ability to dispose of assets in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions which could have an adverse effect on our sources of working capital and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\nWe have an investment in marketable equity securities. The value of this investment may decline as a result of operating performance or economic or market conditions.\nWe have an investment in The Macerich Company (\u201cMacerich\u201d), a retail shopping center company. As of December 31, 2020, this investment had a carrying amount of $6,024,000. A decline in the value of this investment due to, among other reasons, Macerich\u2019s operating performance or economic or market conditions, would result in recognized GAAP losses, which could be material.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL\nSubstantially all of our assets are owned by subsidiaries. We depend on dividends and distributions from these subsidiaries. The creditors of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to us.\nSubstantially all of our properties and assets are held through our subsidiaries. We depend on cash distributions and dividends from our subsidiaries for substantially all of our cash flow. The creditors of each of our direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary\u2019s obligations to them when due and payable before that subsidiary may make distributions or dividends to us. Thus, our ability to pay dividends, if any, to our security holders depends on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to first satisfy their obligations to their creditors and our ability to satisfy our obligations, if any, to our creditors.\nIn addition, our participation in any distribution of the assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation, reorganization or insolvency of the subsidiary, is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors, and preferred security holders, if any, of the applicable direct or indirect subsidiaries are satisfied.\nOur existing financing documents contain covenants and restrictions that may restrict our operational and financial flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of $1,164,544,000, secured by four of our properties. These mortgages contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness on these properties, provide for lender approval of tenants\u2019 leases in certain circumstances, and provide for yield maintenance or defeasance premiums to prepay them. These mortgages may significantly restrict our operational and financial flexibility. In addition, if we were to fail to perform our obligations under existing indebtedness or become insolvent or were liquidated, secured creditors would be entitled to payment in full from the proceeds of the sale of the pledged assets prior to any proceeds being paid to other creditors or to any holders of our securities. In such an event, it is possible that we would have insufficient assets remaining to make payments to other creditors or to any holders of our securities.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could affect our future operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, total debt outstanding was $1,164,544,000. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service. Our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments in the market or at our properties, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from our properties. Should such events occur, our operations may be adversely affected. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value.\nWe have outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.\nAs of December 31, 2020, total debt outstanding was $1,164,544,000 and our ratio of total debt to total enterprise value was 54.1%. \u201cEnterprise value\u201d means the market equity value of our common stock, plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents at such date. In addition, we have significant debt service obligations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our cash payments for principal and interest were $72,476,000. In the future, we may incur additional debt, and thus increase the ratio of total debt to total enterprise value. If our level of indebtedness increases, there may be an increased risk of default which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in a rising interest rate environment, the cost of refinancing our existing debt and any new debt or market rate security or instrument may increase. Continued uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms or at all, which may negatively affect our ability to refinance our debt.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE\nLoss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe are dependent on the efforts of Steven Roth, our Chief Executive Officer. Although we believe that we could find a replacement, the loss of his services could harm our operations and adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nAlexander\u2019s charter documents and applicable law may hinder any attempt to acquire us.\nProvisions in Alexander\u2019s certificate of incorporation and by laws, as well as provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d) and Delaware corporate law, may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to stockholders, and limit the stockholders\u2019 opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then prevailing market prices.\nPrimarily to facilitate maintenance of its qualification as a REIT, Alexander\u2019s certificate of incorporation generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 9.9% of the outstanding shares of preferred stock of any class or 4.9% of outstanding common stock of any class. The Board of Directors may waive or modify these ownership limits with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of these limits will not jeopardize Alexander\u2019s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Board of Directors has, subject to certain conditions and limitations, exempted Vornado and certain of its affiliates from these ownership limitations. Stock owned in violation of these ownership limits will be subject to the loss of rights and other restrictions. These ownership limits may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control.\nAlexander\u2019s Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors. Directors of each class are chosen for three-year staggered terms. Staggered terms of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management, even though changes in management or a change in control might be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nIn addition, Alexander\u2019s charter documents authorize the Board of Directors to:\n\u2022cause Alexander\u2019s to issue additional authorized but unissued common stock or preferred stock;\n\u2022classify or reclassify, in one or more series, any unissued preferred stock; and\n\u2022set the preferences, rights and other terms of any classified or reclassified stock that Alexander\u2019s issues.\nThe Board of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock with terms that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of Alexander\u2019s or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders, although the Board of Directors does not, at present, intend to establish a series of preferred stock of this kind. Alexander\u2019s charter documents contain other provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of the Company or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nIn addition, Vornado, Interstate and its three general partners (each of whom are both trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexander\u2019s) together beneficially own approximately 58.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock. This degree of ownership is likely to reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of the Company by a third party.\nWe may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.\nOur operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate or other assets, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our stockholders do not control these policies.\nSteven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Interstate and its partners owned approximately 7.0% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and approximately 26.1% of our outstanding common stock. Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners of Interstate. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado and the Managing General Partner of Interstate. Mr. Wight and Mr. Mandelbaum are both trustees of Vornado and members of our Board of Directors. In addition, Vornado manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Vornado owned 32.4% of our outstanding common stock, in addition to the 26.1% owned by Interstate and its partners. In addition to the relationships described in the immediately preceding paragraph, Dr. Richard West and Mandakini Puri are both trustees of Vornado and members of our Board of Directors and Matthew Iocco, our Chief Financial Officer, is the Executive Vice President - Chief Accounting Officer of Vornado.\nBecause of their overlapping interests, Vornado, Mr. Roth, Interstate and the other individuals noted in the preceding paragraphs may have substantial influence over Alexander\u2019s, and on the outcome of any matters submitted to Alexander\u2019s stockholders for approval. In addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest among Vornado, Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight and Interstate and other security holders. Vornado, Mr. Roth and Interstate may, in the future, engage in a wide variety of activities in the real estate business which may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us, such as, which of these entities or persons, if any, may take advantage of potential business opportunities, the business focus of these entities, the types of properties and geographic locations in which these entities make investments, potential competition between business activities conducted, or sought to be conducted, by us, competition for properties and tenants, possible corporate transactions such as acquisitions, and other strategic decisions affecting the future of these entities.\nThere may be conflicts of interest between Vornado, its affiliates and us.\nVornado manages, develops and leases our properties under agreements that have one-year terms expiring in March of each year, which are automatically renewable. Because we share common senior management with Vornado and because five of the trustees of Vornado are on our Board of Directors, the terms of the foregoing agreements and any future agreements may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.\nFor a description of Interstate\u2019s ownership of Vornado and Alexander\u2019s, see \u201cSteven Roth, Vornado and Interstate may exercise substantial influence over us. They and some of our other directors and officers have interests or positions in other entities that may compete with us.\u201d above.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON SHARES\nThe trading price of our common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate.\nThe trading price of our common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of several factors, many of which are outside of our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our common shares. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common shares are:\n\u2022our financial condition and performance;\n\u2022the financial condition of our tenants, including the extent of tenant bankruptcies or defaults;\n\u2022the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022our dividend policy;\n\u2022the reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally and the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed income securities;\n\u2022uncertainty and volatility in the equity and credit markets;\n\u2022fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u2022changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs;\n\u2022failure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022the extent of institutional investor interest in us;\n\u2022the extent of short-selling of our common shares and the shares of our competitors;\n\u2022fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022general financial and economic market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for REITs and other real estate related companies;\n\u2022domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022changes in tax laws and rules; and\n\u2022all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for stockholders.\nAlexander\u2019s has additional shares of its common stock available for future issuance, which could decrease the market price of the common stock currently outstanding.\nThe interest of our current stockholders could be diluted if we issue additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2020, we had authorized but unissued 4,826,550 shares of common stock, par value of $1.00 per share and 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share; of which 14,916 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance upon redemption of the deferred stock units previously granted to our Board of Directors. In addition, 490,871 shares are available for future grant under the terms of our 2016 Omnibus Stock Plan. These awards may be granted in the form of options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock units, or other equity-based interests, and if granted, would reduce that number of shares available for future grants, provided however that an award that may be settled only in cash, would not reduce the number of shares available under the plan. We cannot predict the impact that future issuances of common or preferred stock or any exercise of outstanding options or grants of additional equity-based interests would have on the market price of our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY COMPLIANCE\nWe might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT, and may be required to pay federal income taxes at corporate rates.\nAlthough we believe that we will remain organized and will continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we might fail to remain qualified. Qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the Code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and depends on various facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the relevant tax laws and/or the federal income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT. If, with respect to any taxable year, we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions, we could not deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would have to pay federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The federal income tax payable would include any applicable alternative minimum tax. If we had to pay federal income tax, the amount of money available to distribute to stockholders and pay our indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved, and we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders in that taxable year and in future years until we were able to qualify as a REIT and did so. In addition, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost, unless we were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions.\nWe may face possible adverse changes in federal tax laws, which may result in an increase in our tax liability.\nAt any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. We cannot predict if or when any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. Alexander\u2019s, its taxable REIT subsidiaries, and our security holders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation.\nWe may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and environmental contamination may impair our ability to lease and/or sell real estate.\nOur operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also impair our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are also regulated by federal and state laws. We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from our properties.\nEach of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment. To date, these environmental assessments have not revealed any environmental condition material to our business. However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, human exposure to contamination or changes in clean-up or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us.\nIn addition, we may become subject to costs or taxes, or increases therein, associated with natural resource or energy usage (such as a \u201ccarbon tax\u201d). These costs or taxes could increase our operating costs and decrease the cash available to pay our obligations or distribute to stockholders.\nWe face risks associated with our tenants being designated \u201cProhibited Persons\u201d by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar requirements.\nPursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury (\u201cOFAC\u201d) maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned (\u201cProhibited Persons\u201d) from conducting business or engaging in transactions in the United States and thereby restricts our doing business with such persons. In addition, our leases, loans and other agreements may require us to comply with OFAC and related requirements, and any failure to do so may result in a breach of such agreements. If a tenant or other party with whom we conduct business is placed on the OFAC list or is otherwise a party with whom we are prohibited from doing business, we may be required to terminate the lease or other agreement or face other penalties. Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or otherwise negatively affect our financial results and cash flows.\nWe may face possible adverse state and local tax audits and changes in state and local tax law.\nBecause we are organized and qualify as a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes, but we are subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate have undergone tax audits. There can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFrom time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends and distributions to our stockholders.\nCompliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.\nThe ADA generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, meet certain Federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the Federal government or the award of damages to private litigants and/or legal fees to their counsel. If, under the ADA, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nOur properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.\nGENERAL RISKS\nThe occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cyber security, as well as other disruptions of our IT networks and related systems, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships or reputation, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons who access our systems from inside or outside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Although we have not experienced cyber incidents that are individually, or in the aggregate, material, we have experienced cyber attacks in the past, which have thus far been mitigated by preventative, detective, and responsive measures that we have put in place. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Unauthorized parties, whether within or outside our company, may disrupt or gain access to our systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through human error, misfeasance, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceit, including break-ins, use of stolen credentials, social engineering, phishing, computer viruses or other malicious codes, and similar means of unauthorized and destructive tampering. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed to not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.\nA security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; subject us to litigation claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, fines, penalties, governmental investigations and enforcement actions or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally. Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA cyber attack or systems failure could interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting requirements, which could adversely affect us. A cyber attack could also compromise the confidential information of our employees, tenants, customers and vendors. A successful attack could disrupt and materially affect our business operations, including damaging relationships with tenants, customers and vendors. Any compromise of our information security systems could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information (which may be confidential, proprietary and/or commercially sensitive in nature) and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.\nCapital markets and economic conditions can materially affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations as well as the value of an investment in our debt and equity securities.\nThere are many factors that can affect the value of our equity securities and any debt securities we may issue in the future, including the state of the capital markets and economy. Demand for office and retail space typically declines nationwide due to an economic downturn, bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting. Government action or inaction may adversely affect the state of the capital markets. The cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our results of operations, and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants. Our inability or the inability of our tenants to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations and the value of our equity securities and any debt securities we may issue in the future.\nSome of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.\nWe maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, of which the first $1,000,000 includes communicable disease coverage, and all-risk property and rental value insurance coverage with limits of $1.7 billion per occurrence, including coverage for acts of terrorism, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods and earthquakes on each of our properties and excluding communicable disease coverage.\nFifty Ninth Street Insurance Company, LLC (\u201cFNSIC\u201d), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (\u201cNBCR\u201d) acts, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended to date and which has been extended through December 2027. Coverage for acts of terrorism (including NBCR acts) is up to $1.7 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to FNSIC. For NBCR acts, FNSIC is responsible for a $275,000 deductible and 20% of the balance of a covered loss, and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 80% of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by FNSIC.\nWe continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism or other events. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material.\nThe principal amounts of our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us and the loans contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. If lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties.\nChanges in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined and phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may affect our financial results.\nThe chief executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In response, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, the benchmark administrator for USD LIBOR rates, proposed extending the publication of certain commonly used USD LIBOR settings until June 30, 2023 and the FCA issued a statement supporting such proposal. In connection with this proposal, certain U.S. banking regulators issued guidance strongly encouraging banks to generally cease entering into new contracts referencing USD LIBOR as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, including when LIBOR will cease to be available or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the SOFR markets.\nWe have outstanding debt with variable rates based on LIBOR. In the transition from the use of LIBOR to SOFR or other alternatives, the level of interest payments we incur may change. In addition, although certain of our LIBOR based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the related interest rate payable (including transition to an alternative benchmark rate) if LIBOR is not reported, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if LIBOR was available in its current form. Use of alternative interest rates or other LIBOR reforms could result in increased volatility or a tightening of credit markets which could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost-effective financing. In addition, the transition of our existing LIBOR financing agreements to alternative benchmarks may result in unanticipated changes to the overall interest rate paid on our liabilities.",

    "item_2": "ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nThe following table shows the location, ownership, approximate size (excluding parking garages) and occupancy of each of our properties as of December 31, 2020.\nOperating Properties\n731 Lexington Avenue\n731 Lexington Avenue, a 1,323,000 square foot multi-use building, comprises the entire block bounded by Lexington Avenue, East 59th Street, Third Avenue and East 58th Street in Manhattan, New York, and is situated in the heart of one of Manhattan\u2019s busiest business and shopping districts, with convenient access to several subway and bus lines. The property is located across the street from Bloomingdale\u2019s flagship store and only a few blocks away from Fifth Avenue and 57th Street. The building contains 920,000 and 155,000 of net rentable square feet of office and retail space, respectively, which we own, and 248,000 square feet of residential space consisting of 105 condominium units, which we sold. Bloomberg occupies all of the office space. The Home Depot (83,000 square feet) is the principal retail tenant.\nThe office portion of 731 Lexington Avenue is encumbered by a mortgage loan with a balance of $500,000,000 which matures in June 2021, with three one-year unilateral extension options. The interest-only loan is at LIBOR plus 0.90% (1.06% as of December 31, 2020). In connection therewith, we purchased an interest rate cap with a notional amount of $500,000,000 that caps LIBOR at a rate of 6.0%.\nThe retail portion of 731 Lexington Avenue is encumbered by a mortgage loan with a balance of $300,000,000 which matures in August 2025. The interest-only loan is at LIBOR plus 1.40% (1.55% as of December 31, 2020) which is subject to an interest rate swap with a fixed rate of 1.72%.\nRego Park I\nRego Park I, a 338,000 square foot shopping center, located on Queens Boulevard and 63rd Road in Queens, New York. The center is anchored by a 112,000 square foot IKEA, a 50,000 square foot Burlington, a 46,000 square foot Bed Bath & Beyond and a 36,000 square foot Marshalls. The center contains a parking deck (1,241 spaces) that provides for paid parking.\nRego Park II\nRego Park II, a 609,000 square foot shopping center, adjacent to the Rego Park I shopping center in Queens, New York. The center is anchored by a 145,000 square foot Costco and a 133,000 square foot Kohl\u2019s, which has been subleased. On September 10, 2020, Century 21 ($6,400,000 of annual revenue) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed its 135,000 square foot store on December 7, 2020. The center contains a parking deck (1,326 spaces) that provides for paid parking.\nThis center is encumbered by a mortgage loan in the amount of $252,544,000 which matures in December 2025. The interest-only loan is at LIBOR plus 1.35% (1.50% as of December 31, 2020). As of December 31, 2020, we have a participation in the mortgage in the amount of $50,000,000 which for GAAP purposes is netted against the mortgage balance. Therefore, the balance sheet amount of the mortgage loan is $202,544,000.\nThe Alexander Apartment Tower\nThe Alexander apartment tower, located above our Rego Park II shopping center, contains 312 units aggregating 255,000 square feet.\nThe property is encumbered by a mortgage loan in the amount of $94,000,000 which matures in November 2027. The interest-only loan has a fixed rate of 2.63%.\nOperating Properties - continued\nParamus\nWe own 30.3 acres of land located at the intersection of Routes 4 and 17 in Paramus, New Jersey. The land is located directly across from the Garden State Plaza regional shopping mall and is within two miles of three other regional shopping malls and ten miles of New York City. The land has been ground leased to IKEA since 2001. The lease expires in 2041, with a purchase option in October 2021 for $75,000,000. The property is encumbered by a $68,000,000 interest-only mortgage loan with a fixed rate of 4.72%, which matures in October 2021. The annual triple-net rent is the sum of $700,000 plus the amount of interest on the mortgage loan. If the purchase option is exercised, we will receive net cash proceeds of approximately $7,000,000 and recognize a gain on sale of land of approximately $60,000,000. If the purchase option is not exercised, the triple-net rent for the last 20 years would include debt service sufficient to fully amortize $68,000,000 over the remaining 20-year lease term.\nFlushing\nOur Flushing property is located on Roosevelt Avenue and Main Street in the downtown, commercial section of Flushing, Queens, New York. Roosevelt Avenue and Main Street are active shopping districts and there are many national retailers located in the area. A subway entrance is located directly in front of the property with bus service across the street. The property comprises a four-floor building containing 167,000 square feet and a parking garage, which is sub-leased to New World Mall LLC for the remainder of our ground lease term, which expires in January 2027 and has one 10-year extension option.\nProperty to be Developed\nRego Park III\nWe own a 140,000 square foot land parcel adjacent to the Rego Park II shopping center in Queens, New York, at the intersection of Junction Boulevard and the Horace Harding Service Road. The land is currently being used for paid public parking. In 2016, the Company started the entitlement process.",

In our opinion, after consultation with our legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn June 2014, Sears Roebuck and Co. (\u201cSears\u201d) filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against Vornado and us (and certain of our subsidiaries) with regard to the 195,000 square foot store that Sears formerly leased at our Rego Park I property alleging that the defendants are liable for harm that Sears has suffered as a result of (a) water intrusions into the premises, (b) two fires in February 2014 that caused damages to those premises, and (c) alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act in the premises\u2019 parking garage. Sears asserted various causes of actions for damages and sought to compel compliance with landlord\u2019s obligations to repair the premises and to provide security, and to compel us to abate a nuisance that Sears claims was a cause of the water intrusions into its premises. In addition to injunctive relief, Sears sought, among other things, damages of not less than $4,000,000 and future damages it estimated would not be less than $25,000,000. In March 2016, Sears withdrew its claim for future damages leaving a remaining claim for property damages, which we estimate to be approximately $650,000 based on information provided by Sears. We intend to defend the remaining claim vigorously. The amount or range of reasonably possible losses, if any, is not expected to be greater than $650,000. On October 15, 2018, Sears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief resulting in an automatic stay of this case.",

(NYSE: ALX) is a real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d), incorporated in Delaware, engaged in leasing, managing, developing and redeveloping its properties. All references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cCompany\u201d and \u201cAlexander\u2019s\u201d refer to Alexander\u2019s, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We are managed by, and our properties are leased and developed by, Vornado Realty Trust (\u201cVornado\u201d) (NYSE: VNO). We have seven properties in the greater New York City metropolitan area.\nWe compete with a large number of property owners and developers. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, the availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends, zoning laws, and our ability to lease, sublease or sell our properties, at profitable levels. Our success is also subject to our ability to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms as it comes due.\nIn January 2021, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No. 33-10890, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, and Supplementary Financial Information. This rule, which became effective on February 10, 2021, adopts amendments to modernize, simplify and enhance certain financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K. Specifically, the amendments eliminate the requirement for Selected Financial Data, streamline the requirement to disclose Supplementary Financial Information, and amend our Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d). We early adopted the amendments to two items resulting in the elimination of Item 301, Selected Financial Data, and the omission of Item 302(a), Supplementary Financial Information. The amendments to Item 303(a)(b) MD&A, will be adopted in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business has been adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, our \u201cnon-essential\u201d retail tenants were ordered to temporarily close and although substantially all re-opened in the latter part of June 2020, there are limitations on occupancy and other restrictions that affect their ability to resume full operations.\nIn limited circumstances, we have agreed to and may continue to agree to rent deferrals and abatements for certain of our tenants. We have made the policy election available to us based on the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (\u201cFASB\u201d) guidance for leases during the COVID-19 pandemic, which allows us to continue recognizing rental revenue for rent deferral agreements and to recognize rent abatements as a reduction to rental revenue in the period granted. See Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOverall, we have collected approximately 95% of rent billed for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 (96% including rent deferrals under agreements which generally require repayment in monthly installments over a period of time not to exceed twelve months), including 100% for our office tenant, approximately 90% for our retail tenants (91% including rent deferrals) and approximately 98% for our residential tenants.\nOn September 10, 2020, Century 21, which leased 135,000 square feet at our Rego Park II shopping center ($6,400,000 of annual revenue), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed its store on December 7, 2020.\nBased on our assessment of the probability of collecting rent from certain tenants, we have written off as uncollectible tenant receivables of $4,122,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in a reduction of rental revenues. Of this amount, $2,716,000 is attributable to Century 21. In addition, we have written off receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents related to these tenants of $10,837,000 during the year ended December 31 2020, resulting in a reduction of rental revenues. Of this amount, $5,919,000 is attributable to Century 21. Prospectively, revenue recognition for these tenants will be based on actual amounts received.\nOverview - continued\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Financial Results Summary\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $41,939,000 or $8.19 per diluted share, compared to $60,075,000, or $11.74 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFunds from operations (\u201cFFO\u201d) (non-GAAP) for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $82,509,000, or $16.11 per diluted share, compared to $99,670,000, or $19.47 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2020 Financial Results Summary\nNet income for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was $18,432,000, or $3.60 per diluted share, compared to $14,434,000, or $2.82 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2019.\nFFO (non-GAAP) for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was $25,407,000, or $4.96 per diluted share, compared to $24,626,000, or $4.81 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2019.\nSquare Footage, Occupancy and Leasing Activity\nAs of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was comprised of seven properties aggregating 2,444,000 square feet, of which 2,366,000 square feet was in service and 78,000 square feet (a portion of our Rego Park I shopping center) was out of service due to redevelopment. The in service square feet was 97% occupied as of December 31, 2020.\nFinancing Activity\nOn February 14, 2020, we reduced our participation in our Rego Park II shopping center loan to $50,000,000 and received cash proceeds of approximately $145,000,000.\nOn September 14, 2020, we amended and extended the $350,000,000 mortgage loan on the retail condominium of our 731 Lexington Avenue property. Under the terms of the amendment, we paid down the loan by $50,000,000 to $300,000,000, extended the maturity date to August 2025 and guaranteed the interest payments and certain leasing costs. The principal of the loan is non-recourse to us. The interest-only loan is at LIBOR plus 1.40% (1.55% as of December 31, 2020) which is subject to an interest rate swap with a fixed rate of 1.72%.\nOn October 23, 2020, we completed a financing of The Alexander apartment tower in the amount of $94,000,000. The interest-only loan has a fixed rate of 2.63% and matures in November 2027.\nSignificant Tenant\nBloomberg accounted for revenue of $109,066,000, $109,113,000, and $107,356,000 in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing approximately 55%, 48% and 46% of our total revenues in each year, respectively. No other tenant accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. If we were to lose Bloomberg as a tenant, or if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its obligations under its lease, it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In order to assist us in our continuing assessment of Bloomberg\u2019s creditworthiness, we receive certain confidential financial information and metrics from Bloomberg. In addition, we access and evaluate financial information regarding Bloomberg from other private sources, as well as publicly available data.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of our accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. This summary should be read in conjunction with a more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates - continued\nReal Estate\nReal estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying amount of our real estate, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, was $720,921,000 and $716,843,000, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are generally expensed as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. If we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated. We capitalize all property operating expenses directly associated with and attributable to, the development and construction of a project, including interest expense. The capitalization period begins when development activities are underway and ends when it is determined that the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, which is typically evidenced by the receipt of a temporary certificate of occupancy. General and administrative costs are expensed as incurred.\nOur properties, including properties to be developed in the future, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset, including an estimated terminal value calculated using an appropriate capitalization rate. Estimates of future cash flows are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared. For our development properties, estimates of future cash flows also include all future expenditures necessary to develop the asset, including interest payments that will be capitalized as part of the cost of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and is measured based on the excess of the property\u2019s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. If our estimates of future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or fair values change, based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates of future cash flows are subjective and are based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur rental revenues include revenues from the leasing of space to tenants at our properties and revenues from parking and tenant services. We have the following revenue recognition policies:\n\u2022 Lease revenues from the leasing of space to tenants at our properties. Revenues derived from base rent are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements. We commence rental revenue recognition when the underlying asset is available for use by the lessee. In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Revenues derived from the reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance expenses and common area maintenance expenses are generally recognized in the same period as the related expenses are incurred. As lessor, we have elected to combine the lease components (base and variable rent), non-lease components (reimbursements of common area maintenance expenses) and reimbursement of real estate taxes and insurance expenses from our operating lease agreements and account for the components as a single lease component in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d).\n\u2022 Parking revenue arising from the rental of parking spaces at our properties. This income is recognized as the services are transferred in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d).\n\u2022 Tenant services is revenue arising from sub-metered electric, elevator and other services provided to tenants at their request. This revenue is recognized as the services are transferred in accordance with ASC 606.\nUnder ASC 842, we must assess on an individual lease basis whether it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the future lease payments. We consider the tenant\u2019s payment history and current credit status when assessing collectability. When collectability is not deemed probable, we write-off the tenant\u2019s receivables, including straight-line rent receivable, and limit lease income to cash received. We recognize changes in the collectability assessment of our operating leases as adjustments to rental revenues.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates - continued\nIncome Taxes\nWe operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 - 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to stockholders each year. We distribute to our stockholders 100% of our taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our stockholders, or fail to meet other REIT requirements, we may fail to qualify as a REIT, which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences.\nResults of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019\nRental Revenues\nRental revenues were $199,142,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $226,350,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $27,208,000. This decrease was primarily due to (i) $10,837,000 from the write-off of receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents from certain of our retail tenants, of which $5,919,000 is attributable to Century 21, (ii) $10,512,000 from retail tenant vacancies at our 731 Lexington Avenue property and (iii) $5,590,000 of lower rental income from certain of our retail tenants which were deemed uncollectible, of which $3,036,000 is attributable to Century 21.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $88,403,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $89,738,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $1,335,000. This decrease was primarily due to lower operating expenses subject to recovery, including utilities and common area maintenance.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $32,357,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $31,351,000 in the prior year, an increase of $1,006,000. This increase is primarily due to the acceleration of amortization of deferred leasing costs related to Century 21 at our Rego Park II property.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $6,307,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $5,772,000 in the prior year, an increase of $535,000. This increase was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense in connection with the fair value of deferred stock units granted to a newly appointed member of our Board of Directors during the second quarter of 2020, comprised of an initial award of $150,000 and a $56,000 annual award and $245,000 due to higher professional fees.\nInterest and Other Income, net\nInterest and other income, net was $2,667,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $8,244,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $5,577,000. This decrease was primarily due to $5,216,000 of lower interest income due to a decrease in interest rates.\nInterest and Debt Expense\nInterest and debt expense was $24,204,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $38,901,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $14,697,000. This decrease was primarily due to $15,149,000 of lower interest expense due to a decrease in LIBOR.\nChange in Fair Value of Marketable Securities\nChange in fair value of marketable securities was an expense of $8,599,000 in the year ended December 31, 2020, consisting of $8,698,000 resulting from a decrease in Macerich\u2019s share price of $16.25 on 535,265 shares owned, partially offset by $99,000 resulting from an increase in Macerich\u2019s share price of $3.37 on 29,347 shares owned. Change in fair value of marketable securities was an expense of $8,757,000 in the prior year, resulting from a decrease in Macerich\u2019s share prices of $16.36 on 535,265 shares owned.\nResults of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018\nRental Revenues\nRental revenues were $226,350,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $232,825,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $6,475,000. This decrease was primarily due to the Sears vacancy effective October 2018 at our Rego Park I property.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $89,738,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $93,775,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $4,037,000. This decrease was primarily due to bad debt expense in 2018 of $4,459,000, primarily due to the Sears bankruptcy and lease termination.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $31,351,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $33,089,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $1,738,000. This decrease was primarily due to acceleration of depreciation and amortization in 2018 related to the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Inc. bankruptcy and lease termination at our Rego Park II property.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $5,772,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $5,343,000 in the prior year, an increase of $429,000. This increase was primarily due to higher professional fees.\nInterest and Other Income, net\nInterest and other income, net was $8,244,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $12,546,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $4,302,000. This decrease was primarily due to (i) $7,126,000 of interest income in 2018 from our Rego Park II loan participation (on December 12, 2018, we refinanced our $252,544,000 Rego Park II shopping center mortgage loan and GAAP required that our loan participation be treated as an extinguishment of debt), partially offset by (ii) $1,364,000 of higher interest income due to an increase in average interest rates and (iii) $1,600,000 of expense in 2018 from a litigation settlement.\nInterest and Debt Expense\nInterest and debt expense was $38,901,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $44,533,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $5,632,000. This decrease was primarily due to $7,178,000 of lower interest expense due to the refinancing of our Rego Park II shopping center loan, partially offset by $1,810,000 of higher interest expense resulting from an increase in average interest rates.\nChange in Fair Value of Marketable Securities\nChange in fair value of marketable securities was an expense of $8,757,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting from Macerich\u2019s closing share prices of $26.92 and $43.28 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, on 535,265 shares owned. Change in fair value of marketable securities was an expense of $11,990,000 in the prior year, resulting from Macerich\u2019s closing share prices of $43.28 and $65.68 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nLoss from Discontinued Operations\nLoss from discontinued operations was $23,797,000 in the year ended December 31, 2018. The loss was due to an expense for potential additional real property transfer taxes from the 2012 sale of the Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center (\u201cKings Plaza\u201d). See Note 7 - Discontinued Operations, to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRelated Party Transactions\nVornado\nAs of December 31, 2020, Vornado owned 32.4% of our outstanding common stock. We are managed by, and our properties are leased and developed by, Vornado, pursuant to various agreements, which expire in March of each year and are automatically renewable. These agreements are described in Note 5 - Related Party Transactions, to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSteven Roth is the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, the Managing General Partner of Interstate Properties (\u201cInterstate\u201d), a New Jersey general partnership, and the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado. As of December 31, 2020, Mr. Roth, Interstate and its other two general partners, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. (who are also directors of the Company and trustees of Vornado) owned, in the aggregate, 26.1% of our outstanding common stock, in addition to the 2.3% they indirectly own through Vornado. Matthew Iocco, our Chief Financial Officer, is the Executive Vice President - Chief Accounting Officer of Vornado.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nRental revenue is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent on a number of factors, including the occupancy level and rental rates of our properties, as well as our tenants\u2019 ability to pay their rents. Our properties provide us with a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that enables us to pay our operating expenses, interest expense, recurring capital expenditures and cash dividends to stockholders. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in limited circumstances, we have agreed to and may continue to agree to rent deferrals and abatements for certain of our tenants. Overall, we have collected approximately 95% of rent billed for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 (96% including rent deferrals under agreements which generally require repayment in monthly installments over a period of time not to exceed twelve months), including 100% for our office tenant, approximately 90% for our retail tenants (91% including rent deferrals) and approximately 98% for our residential tenants. On September 10, 2020, Century 21, which leased 135,000 square feet at our Rego Park II shopping center ($6,400,000 of annual revenue), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed its store on December 7, 2020. Other sources of liquidity to fund cash requirements include our existing cash, proceeds from financings, including mortgage or construction loans secured by our properties and proceeds from asset sales.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $455,901,000 of liquidity comprised of $449,877,000 of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and $6,024,000 of marketable securities. We anticipate that cash flows from continuing operations over the next twelve months, together with existing cash balances, will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash dividends to stockholders, debt amortization and capital expenditures. We may refinance our maturing debt as it comes due or choose to pay it down. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available to refinance our debt, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to us. The challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on our business and cash flows are evolving rapidly and cannot be predicted at this time but that impact could be material. Consequently, we will continue to evaluate our liquidity and financial position on an ongoing basis.\nDividends\nOn January 20, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend to $4.50 per share (an indicated annual rate of $18.00 per share). The dividend, if declared by the Board of Directors at the same rate for all of 2021, would require us to pay out approximately $92,200,000.\nFinancing Activity and Contractual Obligations\nOn February 14, 2020, we reduced our participation in our Rego Park II shopping center loan to $50,000,000 and received cash proceeds of approximately $145,000,000.\nOn September 14, 2020, we amended and extended the $350,000,000 mortgage loan on the retail condominium of our 731 Lexington Avenue property. Under the terms of the amendment, we paid down the loan by $50,000,000 to $300,000,000, extended the maturity date to August 2025 and guaranteed the interest payments and certain leasing costs. The principal of the loan is non-recourse to us. The interest-only loan is at LIBOR plus 1.40% (1.55% as of December 31, 2020) which is subject to an interest rate swap with a fixed rate of 1.72%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources - continued\nOn October 23, 2020, we completed a financing of The Alexander apartment tower in the amount of $94,000,000. The interest-only loan has a fixed rate of 2.63% and matures in November 2027.\nBelow is a summary of our outstanding debt and maturities as of December 31, 2020. We may refinance our maturing debt as it comes due or choose to repay it.\nBelow is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources - continued\nCommitments and Contingencies\nInsurance\nWe maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, of which the first $1,000,000 includes communicable disease coverage, and all-risk property and rental value insurance coverage with limits of $1.7 billion per occurrence, including coverage for acts of terrorism, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods and earthquakes on each of our properties and excluding communicable disease coverage.\nFifty Ninth Street Insurance Company, LLC (\u201cFNSIC\u201d), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (\u201cNBCR\u201d) acts, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended to date and which has been extended through December 2027. Coverage for acts of terrorism (including NBCR acts) is up to $1.7 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to FNSIC. For NBCR acts, FNSIC is responsible for a $275,000 deductible and 20% of the balance of a covered loss, and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 80% of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by FNSIC.\nWe continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism or other events. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material.\nThe principal amounts of our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us and the loans contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. If lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties.\nParamus\nIn 2001, we leased 30.3 acres of land located in Paramus, New Jersey to IKEA. The lease expires in 2041, with a purchase option in October 2021 for $75,000,000. The property is encumbered by a $68,000,000 interest-only mortgage loan with a fixed rate of 4.72%, which matures in October 2021. The annual triple-net rent is the sum of $700,000 plus the amount of interest on the mortgage loan. If the purchase option is exercised, we will receive net cash proceeds of approximately $7,000,000 and recognize a gain on sale of land of approximately $60,000,000. If the purchase option is not exercised, the triple-net rent for the last 20 years would include debt service sufficient to fully amortize $68,000,000 over the remaining 20-year lease term.\nRego Park I Litigation\nIn June 2014, Sears Roebuck and Co. (\u201cSears\u201d) filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against Vornado and us (and certain of our subsidiaries) with regard to the 195,000 square foot store that Sears formerly leased at our Rego Park I property alleging that the defendants are liable for harm that Sears has suffered as a result of (a) water intrusions into the premises, (b) two fires in February 2014 that caused damages to those premises, and (c) alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act in the premises\u2019 parking garage. Sears asserted various causes of actions for damages and sought to compel compliance with landlord\u2019s obligations to repair the premises and to provide security, and to compel us to abate a nuisance that Sears claims was a cause of the water intrusions into its premises. In addition to injunctive relief, Sears sought, among other things, damages of not less than $4,000,000 and future damages it estimated would not be less than $25,000,000. In March 2016, Sears withdrew its claim for future damages leaving a remaining claim for property damages, which we estimate to be approximately $650,000 based on information provided by Sears. We intend to defend the remaining claim vigorously. The amount or range of reasonably possible losses, if any, is not expected to be greater than $650,000. On October 15, 2018, Sears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief resulting in an automatic stay of this case.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources - continued\nKings Plaza Transfer Tax\nIn 2012, we sold Kings Plaza and paid real property transfer taxes to New York City in connection with the sale. In 2015, the New York City Department of Finance (\u201cNYC DOF\u201d) issued a Notice of Determination to us assessing an additional New York City real property transfer tax amount, including interest.\nIn 2014, in a case with similar facts, the NYC DOF issued a Notice of Determination to a Vornado joint venture assessing an additional New York City real property transfer tax amount, including interest. In January 2017, a New York City administrative law judge made a determination upholding the Vornado joint venture\u2019s position that such additional real property transfer taxes were not due. On February 16, 2018, the New York City Tax Appeals Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) overturned the January 2017 determination. The Vornado joint venture appealed the Tribunal\u2019s decision to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York and on April 25, 2019, the Tribunal\u2019s decision was unanimously upheld. The Vornado joint venture filed a motion to reargue the Appellate Division\u2019s decision or for leave to appeal to the New York State Court of Appeals. On December 12, 2019, that motion was denied and the case can no longer be appealed. Based on the precedent of the Tribunal\u2019s decision, we paid the additional real property transfer taxes of $23,797,000 ($15,874,000 of real property transfer tax and $7,923,000 of interest) on April 5, 2018. On January 12, 2021, we decided not to further contest the additional real property transfer taxes paid in connection with the sale of Kings Plaza.\nLetters of Credit\nApproximately $960,000 of standby letters of credit were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nOther\nThere are various other legal actions against us in the ordinary course of business.

NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciable real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. A reconciliation of our net income to FFO is provided below.\nFFO (non-GAAP) for the years and quarters ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nFFO (non-GAAP) for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $82,509,000, or $16.11 per diluted share, compared to $99,670,000, or $19.47 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFFO (non-GAAP) for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was $25,407,000, or $4.96 per diluted share, compared to $24,626,000, or $4.81 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2019.\nFunds from Operations (\u201cFFO\u201d) (non-GAAP) - continued\nThe following table reconciles our net income to FFO (non-GAAP):",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 16, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

The Company\u2019s evaluation of the recoverability of real estate assets involves the comparison of undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by each real estate asset over the Company\u2019s estimated holding period to the respective carrying amount. The Company\u2019s undiscounted future cash flow analyses require management to make significant estimates, including estimated terminal values determined using appropriate capitalization rates.\nGiven the Company\u2019s estimated capitalization rates used in the evaluation of impairment of real estate assets is a significant assumption made by management, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s undiscounted future cash flow analyses required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the Company\u2019s estimated capitalization rates used in the evaluation of impairment of real estate assets included the following, among others:\n\u2022We tested the effectiveness of controls over management\u2019s evaluation of the recoverability of real estate, including controls over management\u2019s determination of the reasonableness of the applicable capitalization rates.\n\u2022Inquired with management regarding their determination of the capitalization rates, including considerations related to the impact of COVID-19 and evaluating the consistency of the capitalization rates used with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n\u2022With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the Company\u2019s estimated capitalization rates by:\n\u25e6Testing the source information underlying the determination of the capitalization rates by evaluating the reasonableness of the capitalization rates used by management with independent market data, focusing on key factors, including the impact of COVID-19, geographical location, tenant composition, and property type.\n\u25e6Developing a range of independent estimates of capitalization rates and comparing those to the capitalization rates utilized by management.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 16, 2021\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1969.\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nALEXANDER\u2019S, INC.

We are managed by, and our properties are leased and developed by, Vornado Realty Trust (\u201cVornado\u201d) (NYSE: VNO).\nWe have seven properties in the greater New York City metropolitan area consisting of:\nOperating properties\n\u2022731 Lexington Avenue, a 1,323,000 square foot multi-use building, comprising the entire block bounded by Lexington Avenue, East 59th Street, Third Avenue and East 58th Street in Manhattan. The building contains 920,000 and 155,000 of net rentable square feet of office and retail space, respectively, which we own, and 248,000 square feet of residential space consisting of 105 condominium units, which we sold. Bloomberg L.P. (\u201cBloomberg\u201d) occupies all of the office space. The Home Depot (83,000 square feet) is the principal retail tenant;\n\u2022Rego Park I, a 338,000 square foot shopping center, located on Queens Boulevard and 63rd Road in Queens. The center is anchored by a 112,000 square foot IKEA, a 50,000 square foot Burlington, a 46,000 square foot Bed Bath & Beyond and a 36,000 square foot Marshalls;\n\u2022Rego Park II, a 609,000 square foot shopping center, adjacent to the Rego Park I shopping center in Queens. The center is anchored by a 145,000 square foot Costco and a 133,000 square foot Kohl\u2019s, which has been subleased. On September 10, 2020, Century 21 ($6,400,000 of annual revenue) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed its 135,000 square foot store on December 7, 2020;\n\u2022The Alexander apartment tower, located above our Rego Park II shopping center, contains 312 units aggregating 255,000 square feet;\n\u2022Paramus, located at the intersection of Routes 4 and 17 in Paramus, New Jersey, consists of 30.3 acres of land that is leased to IKEA; and\n\u2022Flushing, a 167,000 square foot building, located on Roosevelt Avenue and Main Street in Queens, that is sub-leased to New World Mall LLC for the remainder of our ground lease term.\nProperty to be developed\n\u2022Rego Park III, a 140,000 square foot land parcel adjacent to the Rego Park II shopping center in Queens, at the intersection of Junction Boulevard and the Horace Harding Service Road.\nWe have determined that our properties have similar economic characteristics and meet the criteria that permit the properties to be aggregated into one reportable segment (the leasing, management, development and redeveloping of properties in the greater New York City metropolitan area). Our chief operating decision-maker assesses and measures segment operating results based on a performance measure referred to as net operating income at the individual operating segment. Net operating income for each property represents net rental revenues less operating expenses.\nALEXANDER\u2019S, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n2. COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nOur business has been adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, our \u201cnon-essential\u201d retail tenants were ordered to temporarily close and although substantially all re-opened in the latter part of June 2020, there are limitations on occupancy and other restrictions that affect their ability to resume full operations.\nIn limited circumstances, we have agreed to and may continue to agree to rent deferrals and abatements for certain of our tenants. We have made the policy election available to us based on the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (\u201cFASB\u201d) guidance for leases during the COVID-19 pandemic, which allows us to continue recognizing rental revenue for rent deferral agreements and to recognize rent abatements as a reduction to rental revenue in the period granted. See Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.\nOverall, we have collected approximately 95% of rent billed for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 (96% including rent deferrals under agreements which generally require repayment in monthly installments over a period of time not to exceed twelve months), including 100% for our office tenant, approximately 90% for our retail tenants (91% including rent deferrals) and approximately 98% for our residential tenants.\nOn September 10, 2020, Century 21, which leased 135,000 square feet at our Rego Park II shopping center ($6,400,000 of annual revenue), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed its store on December 7, 2020.\nBased on our assessment of the probability of collecting rent from certain tenants, we have written off as uncollectible tenant receivables of $4,122,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in a reduction of rental revenues. Of this amount, $2,716,000 is attributable to Century 21. In addition, we have written off receivables arising from the straight-lining of rents related to these tenants of $10,837,000 during the year ended December 31 2020, resulting in a reduction of rental revenues. Of this amount, $5,919,000 is attributable to Century 21. Prospectively, revenue recognition for these tenants will be based on actual amounts received.\n3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany amounts have been eliminated. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCertain prior year balances have been reclassified in order to conform to the current period presentation. For the year ended December 31, 2018, \u201cproperty rentals\u201d of $152,795,000 and \u201cexpense reimbursements\u201d of $80,030,000 were grouped into \u201crental revenues\u201d on our consolidated statements of income in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 205 Presentation of Financial Statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Literature - In March 2020, the FASB issued an update (\u201cASU 2020-04\u201d) establishing ASC Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform. ASU 2020-04 contains practical expedients for reference rate reform related activities that impact debt, leases, derivatives and other contracts. The guidance in ASU 2020-04 is optional and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance and our options related to the practical expedients.\nIn April 2020, the FASB issued a Staff Q&A on accounting for leases during the COVID-19 pandemic, focused on the application of lease guidance in ASC Topic 842, Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d). The Staff Q&A states that it would be acceptable to make a policy election regarding rent concessions resulting from COVID-19, which would not require entities to account for these rent concessions as lease modifications when total cash flows resulting from the modified contract are \u201csubstantially the same or less\u201d than the cash flows in the original contract. Entities making the election will continue to recognize rental revenue on a straight-line basis for qualifying concessions. In limited circumstances, we granted temporary rent deferrals and rent abatements to certain tenants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have made a policy election in accordance with the Staff Q&A allowing us to not account for these rent concessions as lease modifications. Accordingly, rent abatements are recognized as reductions to \u201crental revenues\u201d during the period in which they were granted. Rent deferrals result in an increase to \u201ctenant and other receivables\u201d during the deferral period with no impact on rental revenue recognition. For any concessions that do not meet the guidance contained in the Staff Q&A, the modification guidance in accordance with ASC 842 will be applied. See Note 2 - COVID-19 Pandemic for further details.\nALEXANDER\u2019S, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued\nReal Estate - Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying amount of our real estate, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, was $720,921,000 and $716,843,000, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are generally expensed as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. We capitalize all property operating expenses directly associated with and attributable to, the development and construction of a project, including interest expense. The capitalization period begins when development activities are underway and ends when it is determined that the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, which is typically evidenced by the receipt of a temporary certificate of occupancy. General and administrative costs are expensed as incurred.\nOur properties, including properties to be developed in the future, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset, including an estimated terminal value calculated using an appropriate capitalization rate. Estimates of future cash flows are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared. For our development properties, estimates of future cash flows also include all future expenditures necessary to develop the asset, including interest payments that will be capitalized as part of the cost of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and is measured based on the excess of the property\u2019s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. If our estimates of future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or fair values change, based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Estimates of future cash flows are subjective and are based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.\nRevenue Recognition - Our rental revenues include revenues from the leasing of space to tenants at our properties and revenues from parking and tenant services. We have the following revenue recognition policies:\n\u2022Lease revenues from the leasing of space to tenants at our properties. Revenues derived from base rent are recognized over the non-cancelable term of the related leases on a straight-line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements. We commence rental revenue recognition when the underlying asset is available for use by the lessee. In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Revenues derived from the reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance expenses and common area maintenance expenses are generally recognized in the same period as the related expenses are incurred. As lessor, we have elected to combine the lease components (base and variable rent), non-lease components (reimbursements of common area maintenance expenses) and reimbursement of real estate taxes and insurance expenses from our operating lease agreements and account for the components as a single lease component in accordance with ASC 842.\n\u2022 Parking revenue arising from the rental of parking spaces at our properties. This income is recognized as the services are transferred in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d).\n\u2022 Tenant services is revenue arising from sub-metered electric, elevator and other services provided to tenants at their request. This revenue is recognized as the services are transferred in accordance with ASC 606.\nUnder ASC 842, we must assess on an individual lease basis whether it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the future lease payments. We consider the tenant\u2019s payment history and current credit status when assessing collectability. When collectability is not deemed probable, we write-off the tenant\u2019s receivables, including straight-line rent receivable, and limit lease income to cash received. We recognize changes in the collectability assessment of our operating leases as adjustments to rental revenues.\nPrior to the adoption of ASC 842, we maintained an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on receivables under our lease agreements, including receivables arising from the straight-lining of rent. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had $4,459,000 of additions charged against operations and $5,289,000 of uncollectible accounts written off, with an ending allowance for doubtful accounts balance of $671,000 as of December 31, 2018.\nALEXANDER\u2019S, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value, due to their short-term maturities. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents consist of (i) deposits at major commercial banks, which may at times exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit, (ii) United States Treasury Bills, (iii) money market funds, which invest in United States Treasury Bills and (iv) certificates of deposit placed through an account registry service (\u201cCDARS\u201d). To date we have not experienced any losses on our invested cash.\nRestricted Cash - Restricted cash primarily consists of security deposits and other cash escrowed under loan agreements, including for debt service, real estate taxes, property insurance and capital improvements.\nMarketable Securities - Our marketable securities consist of common shares of The Macerich Company (\u201cMacerich\u201d) (NYSE: MAC). These shares are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from the mark-to-market of these securities are recognized in current period earnings in accordance with ASC Topic 825 (\u201cASC 825\u201d), Financial Instruments (see Note 6).\nDeferred Charges - Direct financing costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements as a component of interest and debt expense. Direct costs related to leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases. All other deferred charges are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, in accordance with the terms of the agreements to which they relate.\nIncome Taxes - We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 - 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to stockholders each year. We distribute to our stockholders 100% of our taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. Dividends distributed for the year ended December 31, 2020 were characterized, for federal income tax purposes, as 100.0% ordinary income. Dividends distributed for the year ended December 31, 2019 were characterized, for federal income tax purposes, as 99.6% ordinary income and 0.4% long-term capital gain income. Dividends distributed for the year ended December 31, 2018 were categorized, for federal income tax purposes, as 100.0% ordinary income.\nThe following table reconciles our net income to estimated taxable income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the net basis of our assets and liabilities for tax purposes is approximately $139,364,000 lower than the amount reported for financial statement purposes.\nALEXANDER\u2019S, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n4. REVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe following is a summary of revenue sources for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nThe components of lease revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nVornado\nAs of December 31, 2020, Vornado owned 32.4% of our outstanding common stock. We are managed by, and our properties are leased and developed by, Vornado, pursuant to the agreements described below, which expire in March of each year and are automatically renewable.\nSteven Roth is the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, the Managing General Partner of Interstate Properties (\u201cInterstate\u201d), a New Jersey general partnership, and the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado. As of December 31, 2020, Mr. Roth, Interstate and its other two general partners, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. (who are also directors of the Company and trustees of Vornado) owned, in the aggregate, 26.1% of our outstanding common stock, in addition to the 2.3% they indirectly own through Vornado. Matthew Iocco, our Chief Financial Officer, is the Executive Vice President - Chief Accounting Officer of Vornado.\nManagement and Development Agreements\nWe pay Vornado an annual management fee equal to the sum of (i) $2,800,000, (ii) 2% of gross revenue from the Rego Park II shopping center, (iii) $0.50 per square foot of the tenant-occupied office and retail space at 731 Lexington Avenue, and (iv) $334,000, escalating at 3% per annum, for managing the common area of 731 Lexington Avenue. Vornado is also entitled to a development fee equal to 6% of development costs, as defined.\nLeasing and Other Agreements\nVornado also provides us with leasing services for a fee of 3% of rent for the first ten years of a lease term, 2% of rent for the eleventh through the twentieth year of a lease term, and 1% of rent for the twenty-first through thirtieth year of a lease term, subject to the payment of rents by tenants. In the event third-party real estate brokers are used, the fees to Vornado increase by 1% and Vornado is responsible for the fees to the third-party real estate brokers.\nVornado is also entitled to a commission upon the sale of any of our assets equal to 3% of gross proceeds, as defined, for asset sales less than $50,000,000 and 1% of gross proceeds, as defined, for asset sales of $50,000,000 or more.\nWe also have agreements with Building Maintenance Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of Vornado, to supervise (i) cleaning, engineering and security services at our Lexington Avenue property and (ii) security services at our Rego Park I and Rego Park II properties and The Alexander apartment tower.\nALEXANDER\u2019S, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS - continued\nThe following is a summary of fees to Vornado under the various agreements discussed above.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the amounts due to Vornado were $845,000 for management, property management, cleaning, engineering and security fees; $557,000 for development fees; and $114,000 for leasing fees. As of December 31, 2019, the amounts due to Vornado were $795,000 for management, property management, cleaning, engineering and security fees; $68,000 for development fees; and $563,000 for leasing fees.\n6. MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we owned 564,612 and 535,265 common shares, respectively, of Macerich. The increase in shares owned was due to a dividend received in stock from Macerich during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of these shares was $6,024,000 and $14,409,000, respectively, based on Macerich\u2019s closing share price of $10.67 per share and $26.92 per share, respectively. These shares are presented at fair value as \u201cmarketable securities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and the gains and losses resulting from the mark-to-market of these securities are recognized in current period earnings.\n7. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nIn 2012, we sold the Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center (\u201cKings Plaza\u201d) and paid real property transfer taxes to New York City in connection with the sale. In 2015, the New York City Department of Finance (\u201cNYC DOF\u201d) issued a Notice of Determination to us assessing an additional New York City real property transfer tax amount, including interest.\nIn 2014, in a case with similar facts, the NYC DOF issued a Notice of Determination to a Vornado joint venture assessing an additional New York City real property transfer tax amount, including interest. In January 2017, a New York City administrative law judge made a determination upholding the Vornado joint venture\u2019s position that such additional real property transfer taxes were not due. On February 16, 2018, the New York City Tax Appeals Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) overturned the January 2017 determination. The Vornado joint venture appealed the Tribunal\u2019s decision to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York and on April 25, 2019, the Tribunal\u2019s decision was unanimously upheld. The Vornado joint venture filed a motion to reargue the Appellate Division\u2019s decision or for leave to appeal to the New York State Court of Appeals. On December 12, 2019, that motion was denied and the case can no longer be appealed.\nBased on the precedent of the Tribunal\u2019s decision, we accrued an expense for the potential additional real property transfer taxes of $23,797,000 ($15,874,000 of real property transfer tax and $7,923,000 of interest) during the three months ended March 31, 2018. On April 5, 2018, we paid this amount in order to stop the interest from accruing. As the results related to Kings Plaza were previously classified as discontinued operations, we have classified the expense as \u201closs from discontinued operations\u201d on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2018 in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. On January 12, 2021, we decided not to further contest the additional real property transfer taxes paid in connection with the sale of Kings Plaza.\nALEXANDER\u2019S, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n8. MORTGAGES PAYABLE\nOn February 14, 2020, we reduced our participation in our Rego Park II shopping center loan to $50,000,000 and received cash proceeds of approximately $145,000,000.\nOn September 14, 2020, we amended and extended the $350,000,000 mortgage loan on the retail condominium of our 731 Lexington Avenue property. Under the terms of the amendment, we paid down the loan by $50,000,000 to $300,000,000, extended the maturity date to August 2025 and guaranteed the interest payments and certain leasing costs. The principal of the loan is non-recourse to us. The interest-only loan is at LIBOR plus 1.40% (1.55% as of December 31, 2020) which is subject to an interest rate swap with a fixed rate of 1.72%.\nOn October 23, 2020, we completed a financing of The Alexander apartment tower in the amount of $94,000,000. The interest-only loan has a fixed rate of 2.63% and matures in November 2027.\nThe following is a summary of our outstanding mortgages payable. We may refinance our maturing debt as it comes due or choose to repay it.\nAll of our debt is secured by mortgages and/or pledges of the stock of the subsidiaries holding the properties. The net carrying value of real estate collateralizing the debt amounted to $657,800,000 as of December 31, 2020. Our existing financing documents contain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness on these properties, and in certain circumstances, provide for lender approval of tenants\u2019 leases and yield maintenance to prepay them. As of December 31, 2020, the principal repayments (based on the extended loan maturity dates) for the next five years and thereafter are as follows:\nALEXANDER\u2019S, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d) defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities; Level 2 - observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3 - unobservable inputs that are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\nFinancial assets measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 consist of marketable securities which are presented in the table below based on their level in the fair value hierarchy, and an interest rate cap, the fair value of which was insignificant as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Financial liabilities measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 consist of an interest rate swap which is presented in the table below based on its level in the fair value hierarchy.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities not Measured at Fair Value\nFinancial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets include cash equivalents and mortgages payable. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities and are classified as Level 1. The fair value of our mortgages payable is calculated by discounting the future contractual cash flows of these instruments using current risk-adjusted rates available to borrowers with similar credit ratings, which are provided by a third-party specialist, and is classified as Level 2. The table below summarizes the carrying amount and fair value of these financial instruments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nALEXANDER\u2019S, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n10. LEASES\nAs Lessor\nWe lease space to tenants under operating leases in an office building and in retail centers. The rental terms range from approximately 5 to 25 years. The leases provide for the payment of fixed base rents payable monthly in advance as well as reimbursements of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Retail leases may also provide for the payment by the lessee of additional rents based on a percentage of their sales. We also lease residential space at The Alexander apartment tower with 1 or 2 year lease terms. We have elected to account for lease revenues (including fixed and variable rent) and the reimbursement of common area maintenance expenses as a single lease component presented as \u201crental revenues\u201d on our consolidated statements of income.\nFuture undiscounted cash flows under our contractual non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:\nThese amounts do not include reimbursements or additional rents based on a percentage of retail tenants\u2019 sales.\nBloomberg accounted for revenue of $109,066,000, $109,113,000, and $107,356,000 in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing approximately 55%, 48% and 46% of our total revenues in each year, respectively. No other tenant accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. If we were to lose Bloomberg as a tenant, or if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its obligations under its lease, it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In order to assist us in our continuing assessment of Bloomberg\u2019s creditworthiness, we receive certain confidential financial information and metrics from Bloomberg. In addition, we access and evaluate financial information regarding Bloomberg from other private sources, as well as publicly available data.\nAs Lessee\nWe are the lessee under a ground lease at our Flushing property, classified as an operating lease, which expires in 2027 and has one 10-year extension option. On January 1, 2019, we recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability related to this ground lease equal to the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments. As of December 31, 2020, the right-of-use asset of $3,974,000 and the lease liability of $4,236,000, are included in \u201cother assets\u201d and \u201cother liabilities,\u201d respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. The discount rate applied to measure the right-of-use asset and lease liability is based on the incremental borrowing rate (\u201cIBR\u201d) for the property of 4.53%. We considered the general economic environment and factored in various financing and asset specific adjustments so that the IBR was appropriate to the intended use of the underlying lease. As we did not elect to apply hindsight, the lease term assumption determined under ASC Topic 840, Leases was carried forward and applied in calculating our lease liability recorded under ASC 842.\nALEXANDER\u2019S, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n10. LEASES - continued\nFuture lease payments under this operating lease, excluding the extension option, are as follows:\nWe recognize rent expense as a component of \u201coperating\u201d expenses on our consolidated statements of income on a straight-line basis. Rent expense was $746,000 in each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash paid for rent expense was $800,000 in each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n11. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation (\u201cASC 718\u201d). Our 2016 Omnibus Stock Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d) provides for grants of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock units (\u201cDSUs\u201d) and performance shares, as defined, to the directors, officers and employees of the Company and Vornado.\nIn May 2020, we granted each of the members of our Board of Directors 329 DSUs with a market value of $75,000 per grant. The grant date fair value of these awards was $56,250 per grant, or $450,000 in the aggregate, in accordance with ASC 718. In addition, 876 DSUs, constituting an initial award with a market value of $200,000, were granted to a newly appointed Director. The grant date fair value of this award was $150,000 in accordance with ASC 718. The DSUs entitle the holders to receive shares of the Company\u2019s common stock without the payment of any consideration. The DSUs vested immediately and accordingly, were expensed on the date of grant, but the shares of common stock underlying the DSUs are not deliverable to the grantee until the grantee is no longer serving on the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2020, there were 14,916 DSUs outstanding and 490,871 shares were available for future grant under the Plan.\nALEXANDER\u2019S, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nInsurance\nWe maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, of which the first $1,000,000 includes communicable disease coverage, and all-risk property and rental value insurance coverage with limits of $1.7 billion per occurrence, including coverage for acts of terrorism, with sub-limits for certain perils such as floods and earthquakes on each of our properties and excluding communicable disease coverage.\nFifty Ninth Street Insurance Company, LLC (\u201cFNSIC\u201d), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (\u201cNBCR\u201d) acts, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended to date and which has been extended through December 2027. Coverage for acts of terrorism (including NBCR acts) is up to $1.7 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to FNSIC. For NBCR acts, FNSIC is responsible for a $275,000 deductible and 20% of the balance of a covered loss, and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 80% of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by FNSIC.\nWe continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism or other events. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material.\nThe principal amounts of our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us and the loans contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. If lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties.\nParamus\nIn 2001, we leased 30.3 acres of land located in Paramus, New Jersey to IKEA. The lease expires in 2041, with a purchase option in October 2021 for $75,000,000. The property is encumbered by a $68,000,000 interest-only mortgage loan with a fixed rate of 4.72%, which matures in October 2021. The annual triple-net rent is the sum of $700,000 plus the amount of interest on the mortgage loan. If the purchase option is exercised, we will receive net cash proceeds of approximately $7,000,000 and recognize a gain on sale of land of approximately $60,000,000. If the purchase option is not exercised, the triple-net rent for the last 20 years would include debt service sufficient to fully amortize $68,000,000 over the remaining 20-year lease term.\nRego Park I Litigation\nIn June 2014, Sears Roebuck and Co. (\u201cSears\u201d) filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against Vornado and us (and certain of our subsidiaries) with regard to the 195,000 square foot store that Sears formerly leased at our Rego Park I property alleging that the defendants are liable for harm that Sears has suffered as a result of (a) water intrusions into the premises, (b) two fires in February 2014 that caused damages to those premises, and (c) alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act in the premises\u2019 parking garage. Sears asserted various causes of actions for damages and sought to compel compliance with landlord\u2019s obligations to repair the premises and to provide security, and to compel us to abate a nuisance that Sears claims was a cause of the water intrusions into its premises. In addition to injunctive relief, Sears sought, among other things, damages of not less than $4,000,000 and future damages it estimated would not be less than $25,000,000. In March 2016, Sears withdrew its claim for future damages leaving a remaining claim for property damages, which we estimate to be approximately $650,000 based on information provided by Sears. We intend to defend the remaining claim vigorously. The amount or range of reasonably possible losses, if any, is not expected to be greater than $650,000. On October 15, 2018, Sears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief resulting in an automatic stay of this case.\nLetters of Credit\nApproximately $960,000 of standby letters of credit were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nOther\nThere are various other legal actions against us in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, the outcome of such matters in the aggregate will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nALEXANDER\u2019S, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n13. MULTIEMPLOYER BENEFIT PLANS\nOur subsidiaries make contributions to certain multiemployer defined benefit plans (\u201cMultiemployer Pension Plans\u201d) and health plans (\u201cMultiemployer Health Plans\u201d) for our union represented employees, pursuant to the respective collective bargaining agreements.\nMultiemployer Pension Plans\nMultiemployer Pension Plans differ from single-employer pension plans in that (i) contributions to multiemployer plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers and (ii) if other participating employers fail to make their contributions, each of our subsidiaries may be required to bear their pro rata share of unfunded obligations. If a participating subsidiary withdraws from a plan in which it participates, it may be subject to a withdrawal liability. As of December 31, 2020, our subsidiaries\u2019 participation in these plans were not significant to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 our subsidiaries contributed $191,000, $172,000 and $161,000, respectively, towards Multiemployer Pension Plans. Our subsidiaries\u2019 contributions did not represent more than 5% of total employer contributions in any of these plans for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nMultiemployer Health Plans\nMultiemployer Health Plans in which our subsidiaries participate provide health benefits to eligible active and retired employees. In the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 our subsidiaries contributed $672,000, $686,000 and $649,000, respectively, towards these plans.\n14. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted income per share, including a reconciliation of net income and the number of shares used in computing basic and diluted income per share. Basic income per share is determined using the weighted average shares of common stock (including DSUs) outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is determined using the weighted average shares of common stock (including DSUs) outstanding during the period, and assumes all potentially dilutive securities were converted into common shares at the earliest date possible. There were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.",

The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company\u2019s principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nAs of December 31, 2020, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 is effective.\nThe Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nThe effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 61 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alexander\u2019s, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Alexander\u2019s, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated February 16, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 16, 2021",
