    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS.\nGeneral\nOn March 31, 2011, it was announced that our board had determined it would be in the best interest of our shareholders to transfer all of our online and operational technologies to our subsidiary, Worlds Online Inc. (currently called MariMed Inc.). The assets were transferred as of May 16, 2011 and included: Worlds\u2019 technology platform, Worlds Ultimate Chat, Aerosmith World, DMC Worlds, Cinema Virtual, Pearson contracts and related revenue, URLs: Worlds.com, Cybersexworld.com, Hang.com, and Worldsfunds.com, a digital inventory of over 10,000 3D objects, animation sequences, an extensive avatar library, texture maps and virtual world architectures. The Company also entered into a License Agreement with MariMed Inc. to sublicense its patented technologies, which License expired upon the expiration of the underlying patents.\nWorlds Inc. has retained all of its related Intellectual Property (IP) consisting of the nine existing patents, 6,219,045; 7,181,690; 7,493,558; 7,945,856; 8,082,501; 8,145,998; 8,161,385, 8,407,592 and 8,640,028 and all continuance claims currently before the USPTO including any to be filed going forward. While the last of these patents expired in 2016, we continue to pursue infringement we believe occurred during the lifetime of the patents.\nWe intend to endeavor to prosecute our issued patents and any future issued patents against all parties that the company and our legal counsel believe to be infringing on said patents.\nEnforcement actions are subject to the analysis of all relevant prior art and the costs associated with litigation.\nWe may also seek to acquire additional patents we believe will enhance our portfolio position in the markets within which our existing patents cover.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in our ability to prosecute our IP portfolio or that we will be able to acquire additional patents.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we own approximately 2.9 million shares of MariMed Inc. common stock.\nBefore the spin-off, Worlds was a leading 3D entertainment portal which leveraged its proprietary technology, which we retained through our patent portfolio, to offer visitors a network of virtual, multi-user environments which we call \"worlds\". These worlds are visually engaging online environments featuring animation, motion and content where people can come together and, by navigating through the website, shop, interact with others, attend events and be entertained. In support of this portal and the overall business strategy, we design and develop software, content and related technology for the creation of interactive, three-dimensional (\"3D\") Internet web sites. Using our technology, we created our own Internet sites, as well as sites available through third-party online service providers.\nSites using our technology allow numerous, simultaneous visitors to enter, navigate and share interactive \"worlds\". Our 3D Internet sites are designed to promote frequent, repeat and prolonged visitation by users by providing them with unique online communities featuring dynamic graphics, highly useful and entertaining information content, and interactive capabilities. We believe that sites are highly attractive to advertisers because they offer access to demographic-specific user bases comprised of people that visit the site frequently and stay for relatively long periods of time.\nContents\nRecent developments\nThe Company's lawsuit against the Activision entities, filed in 2012, was stayed in 2015 pending the outcome of nine Inter Partes Review (\u201cIPR\u201d) petitions filed by Bungie, Inc. to the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\u201cPTAB\u201d). Those IPR proceedings were concluded in Company's favor on January 14, 2020, with the majority of the challenged claims surviving Bungie's challenges. Returning to its District Court litigation, the Company asked that Judge Casper lift the stay and allow the Company to proceed in its lawsuit for patent infringement of the Company\u2019s patents against the Activision entities.\nOn April 17, 2020, Judge Casper issued an Order lifting the stay, and setting a pre-trial schedule, with a final pretrial conference and trial to occur at a date to be determined after September 24, 2021. The Court's schedule is as follows:\n\u2022 Fact discovery resumes April 21, 2020. Date by which counsel to meet/confer regarding estoppel issue May 5, 2020. Worlds' narrowed election of asserted claims May 5, 2020. Activision's 35 U.S.C. 101 motion due May 19, 2020. Worlds' opposition to the 35 U.S.C. 101 motion due September 9, 2020.

Worlds' Narrowing of Asserted Claims (No more than 3 claims per patent; 15 claims maximum) January 21, 2021. Activision's Narrowing of Prior Art (No more than 7 prior art references per patent; 20 references total) February 4, 2021.\n\u2022 Status conference February 8, 2021 at 2:00 p.m. Opening expert reports February 18, 2021. Rebuttal expert reports March 25, 2021. Close of Expert Discovery April 15, 2021.\n\u2022 Dispositive motions (can address estoppel issue If still disputed)/Daubert motions due May 13, 2021. Opposition to Dispositive motions/Daubert motions due September 10, 2021. Reply briefs in support of Dispositive motions/Daubert motions due September 24, 2021. Hearing on dispositive motions/Daubert hearing TBD. Final Election deadlines and Final Pretrial Conference TBD.\nOn September 20, 2019, the Company filed a lawsuit against Linden Research, Inc., d/b/a Linden Lab (\u201cLinden\u201d) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware for patent infringement of the Company\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 7,181,690. This case was assigned to Judge Maryellen Noreika. On December 2, 2019, Linden answered the Complaint, denying that it has committed patent infringement. On January 8, 2020, the Court entered a Scheduling Order, setting deadlines for Fact Discovery and Contentions, Claim Construction, Expert Discovery, Summary Judgment, and Trial Phase. The scheduled trial date is January 31, 2022.\nOn September 25, 2020, the Company filed a lawsuit against Microsoft Corporation (\u201cMicrosoft\u201d) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas for patent infringement of the Company\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 8,082,501. This case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Alan D. Albright.\nFor more information see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nOur Technology\nWe used our technology to produce three-dimensional portals and web sites. We believe that our core technology delivers a considerably faster frame rate for user experiences and, in some cases, a meaningful productivity increase in art production and integration over its previous generation production tools. Our technology permits the development of virtual worlds which have broad applications. These applications include but are not limited to:\n\u2022 a virtual meeting place (such as a fan club);\n\u2022 a 3D e-commerce store (where merchandise can be viewed in 3D and purchased online); and\n\u2022 a virtual classroom (where content can be viewed via video streaming and then discussed in real time).\nContents\nOur core technology has substantial elements written in Sun Microsystem's programming language, Java, including WorldsBrowser and WorldsShaper, so we expect that it can be made portable across Windows and UNIX Platforms because of Java's platform independence.\nOur core technology includes:\n\u2022 WorldsShaper: WorldsShaper is the visual authoring component of our platform. It allows for quick assembly of pieces to create multi-user, shared state, virtual worlds. The WorldsShaper is an advanced compositing 3D building tool that integrates pre-existing or custom content, such as 3D models, textures or images created in Adobe's Photoshop, or midi or wave sound files, with architectural geometry and interactive behaviors and actions written in Java. The architectural building blocks for creating 3D worlds, the flexibility and power of integrating professional modeling and imaging tools, and the extensibility via Java make the WorldsShaper a tool well-suited for rapid creation of 3D environments.\n\u2022 WorldsServer: WorldsServer is the scalable software that we use to control and operate our on-line virtual communities. WorldsServer manages the registration and authentication of users, the locations of users within the 3D environment, the physical structure of the 3D environment, all information regarding objects that are \"shared\" by the participants and any of the interactions between the users such as text chat. This platform also integrates an HTTP server for the delivery of other content such as audio and video streaming and secure e-commerce applications.\n\u2022 WorldsBrowser: WorldsBrowser is used to access the 3D environments. The browser is optimized for speed, delivering relatively fast frame rates per second in highly textured virtual 3D worlds.\n\u2022 WorldsPlayer\u2122: The WorldsPlayer allows users to view and experience our multi-user, interactive technology. Any world created with the WorldsShaper will be viewable and navigable with the WorldsPlayer. The WorldsPlayer has a high frame rate for fast, quality graphics, an easy-to-use graphic user interface, 2D web browser integration, automatic upgrade capability over the internet and a complete communication tool set including text chat, voice-to-voice chat, e-mail and animation.\n\u2022 Worlds Gamma Libraries: The Worlds Gamma Libraries are composed of sample worlds, textures, models, avatars, actions, sensors, sounds, motion sequences, and other behaviors.\nContents\nOur Strategy\nWorlds Inc. will be focused solely on expanding our patent portfolio and to enforce our rights where it believes parties are infringing on its IP portfolio.\nCompetition\nSince all operations were transferred to Worlds Online and our business is now the expansion of our patented technology, the Company does not have any direct competition as it did in the past. However, inasmuch as we believe that multi-user, interactive 3D is becoming a \u201chot\u201d area, we expect other companies, many with far more resources than us, to move into this space.\nCurrently, there are many companies collaborating to establish standardization of 3D usage on the Internet, the adoption of which may require changes to our technology.\nIntellectual Property\nU.S. Patents: Worlds has been granted U.S patent 6,219,045, 7,181,690, 7,493,558, 7,945,856, 8,082,501, 8,145,998, 8,161,385, 8,407,592 and 8,640,028 for multi-server technology for 3D applications, which is our core technology. While the patents have all expired, we continue looking into the implications and breadth of the patent in order to maximize their benefits. The description of the initial patent is as follows:\n\"The present invention provides a highly scalable architecture for a three dimensional, multi-user, interactive virtual world system. In a preferred embodiment a plurality of users interact in the three-dimensional, computer-generated graphical space where each user executes a client process to view a virtual world from the perspective of that user. The virtual world shows Avatars representing the other users who are neighbors of the user viewing the virtual world. In order that the view can be updated to reflect the motion of the remote user's Avatar, motion information is transmitted to a central server process that provides position updates to client processes for neighbors of the user at that client process. The client process also uses an environment database to determine which background objects to render as well as to limit the number of displayable Avatars to a maximum number of Avatars displayable by that client.\"\nTrademark: Worldsplayer - The WorldsPlayer is especially designed to allow users to view and experience the multi-user, interactive Worlds Gamma technology. Any world created with the WorldsShaper will be viewable and navigable with WorldsPlayer. Utilizing the WorldsPlayer, a user assumes a persona (via a digital actor, or Avatars), and can then move, view, chat, play, express one's self via gestures and animations, voice chat, send email, join discussion groups, listen to music, shop at Worlds 3D stores, and watch videos, all in the company of users from around the world, within the 3D environment. The WorldsPlayer boasts high frame rate for fast, high quality graphics, an easy to use graphic user interface, seamless 2D Web browser integration, auto-upgrade capability over the Internet, and a complete communication tool set including chat, voice-to-voice chat, email and animation. The WorldsPlayer offers users the unique and creative experience of customizing their Avatars, while maintaining the ability to animate and activate their Avatars.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had one full time employee, our president and chief executive officer, Thomas Kidrin.\nCorporate History\nWe were formed as a result of the contemporaneous mergers on December 3, 1997 of Worlds Inc., a Delaware corporation formed on April 26, 1994 with and into Worlds Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation formed on April 8, 1997 and of Worlds Acquisition Corp. with and into Academic Computer Systems, Inc., a New Jersey corporation formed on May 20, 1968 (the \"Mergers\"). Academic Computer Systems changed its name to Worlds Inc. after the Mergers. In December 1999, we changed our name from Worlds Inc. to Worlds.com Inc. in order to better reflect our business as a consumer Internet web site that offers virtual \"worlds\" in which consumers interact, conduct e-commerce and receive entertainment.\nThe Company created a wholly-owned subsidiary named Worlds Online Inc. on January 25, 2011. On May 16, 2011, Worlds Inc. transferred to Worlds Online Inc. the majority of its operations and related operational assets, except for its patent portfolio. Worlds Online Inc. changed its name to MariMed Inc. in 2017.\nContents",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to numerous risks, including but not limited to those set forth below. Our operations and performance could also be subject to risks that do not exist as of the date of this report but emerge thereafter as well as risks that we do not currently deem material.\nRisks related to our operations\nWe have experienced relatively large losses during our development and, without significant increases in the market penetration of our services and improvements to our operating margins, we will not achieve profitability.\nSince inception we have incurred significant net losses as set forth in the financial information included herein. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for at least the short-term. We will not achieve profitable operations until we successfully develop sources of revenues from our patent portfolio or generate revenues from other sources that are sufficient to offset our operating costs. We may never be able to accomplish these objectives. Patent litigation is very expensive and we may not have sufficient cash available to pursue any patent litigation to its conclusion because currently we do not generate revenues.\nWe are dependent upon the success of our patent infringement lawsuits.\nAfter all of our operations were spun off, our success is essentially dependent upon the success of our patent infringement lawsuits and if we are unsuccessful we will likely cease operations and due to the coronavirus, courts are closing down completely and/or only addressing emergency matters and therefore further prosecution of our lawsuits are delayed indefinitely.\nIt will be difficult for you to evaluate us based on our past performance because we have a relatively new business strategy with a limited operating history.\nWe have been actively engaged in the business of being an IP company for a relatively short period of time and, accordingly, have only limited financial results on which you can evaluate our company and its new operations.\nWe cannot guarantee that the patents issued to us will be broad enough to provide any meaningful protection of our proprietary technologies.\nWe cannot be certain of the level of protection, if any that will be provided by our patents if we attempt to enforce them and they are challenged in court where our competitors may raise defenses such as invalidity, or unenforceability. In addition, the type and extent of any patent claims that may be issued to us in the future are uncertain. Any patents which are issued may not contain claims that will permit us to stop competitors from using similar technology.\nContents\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights.\nThird parties have, and others may, challenge the validity of our patents and other intellectual property rights, resulting in costly litigation or other time-consuming and expensive proceedings, which could deprive us of valuable rights. If we become involved in any intellectual property litigation, interference or other judicial or administrative proceedings, we may incur substantial expenses and the diversion of financial resources and technical and management personnel. An adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially favorable terms, if at all. Further, if such claims are proven valid, through litigation or otherwise, we may be required to pay substantial financial damages, which can be tripled if the infringement is deemed willful, or be required to discontinue or significantly delay development, marketing, selling and licensing of the affected products and intellectual property rights.\nOur competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. There may be third-party patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our potential products that may block or compete with our products or processes. If another party has filed a United States patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our United States patent position with respect to such inventions. In addition, we cannot assure you that we would prevail in any of these suits or that the damages or other remedies if any, awarded against us would not be substantial. Claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to enter into royalty or license agreements with third parties that may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. We may also become subject to injunctions against the further development and use of our technology, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nIf we lose our key personnel our operations could be harmed.\nOur success is currently dependent, in large part, on the personal efforts of Thomas Kidrin, our president and chief executive officer. The loss of Mr. Kidrin's services could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nWe may not be able to economically comply with any new government regulation that may be adopted with respect to the Internet.\nNew Internet legislation or regulation, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and e-commerce could add additional costs and risks to doing business on the Internet. We are subject to regulations applicable to businesses generally and laws or regulations directly applicable to communications over the Internet and access to e-commerce. Although there are currently few laws and regulations directly applicable to e-commerce, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet, covering issues such as user privacy, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, antitrust, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services.\nContents\nRisks related to our common stock\nPossible issuances of our capital stock would cause dilution to our existing shareholders.\nWhile we currently have 56,814,833 shares of common stock outstanding after implementing the 5 to 1 reverse split in 2018, we are authorized to issue up to 250,000,000 shares of common stock. In the event we elect to issue additional shares of common stock in connection with any financing, acquisition or otherwise, current shareholders could find their holdings substantially diluted, which means they will own a smaller percentage of our company. There are also 5 million shares of preferred stock that the board can issue under any terms it wants and without any shareholder approval. Shareholders approved the Company\u2019s proposal to increase the authorized capital and/or a reverse split, the risk described above will is heightened even more.\nCertain shareholders control a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock.\nOur chief executive officer owns a significant portion of the outstanding shares of our common stock and Mr. Kidrin may be issued an additional 5 million post reverse split shares of our common stock upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. Accordingly, he will be able to influence the election of our directors and thereby influence or direct our policies.\nNo dividends have been paid on our common stock.\nTo date, we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not expect to declare or pay dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, the payment of cash dividends may be limited or prohibited by the terms of any future loan agreements.\nWe are subject to \"penny stock\" regulations which may adversely impact the liquidity and price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently deemed a \"penny stock.\" Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information on penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and if the broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer's presumed control over the market, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally, those persons with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouse), the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction.\nThese requirements could reduce the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for our common stock. As a result of the foregoing, our shareholders may find it more difficult to sell their shares.\nContents\nThe exercise or conversion of outstanding options into common stock will dilute the percentage ownership of our other shareholders. The sale of such common stock or other common stock in the open market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there are outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 11,720,000 shares of our common stock and more options and warrants will likely be granted in the future to our officers, directors, employees and consultants. Also, on such date there are outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4,380,000 shares of our common stock. The exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants and conversion of notes will dilute the percentage ownership of our other shareholders. Sales, or the expectation of sales, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, including shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of our stock options, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is creating delays and uncertainties in the economy.\nWe are mindful of the COVID-19 pandemic currently sweeping the world in general and in particular the United States. Inasmuch as our business model does not rely on sales of a product or services or consumer access thereto, we do not believe that we will be negatively impacted by the pandemic and the economic havoc it is currently wreaking on the economies of the United States and the world. Having said that, it is possible that if the pandemic continues for an extended period of time and/or recurs again in the future, it may cause delays in the prosecution of the Company\u2019s lawsuits.\nContents",

Presently, we are operating out of offices in our president's residence at 11 Royal Road, Brookline, Massachusetts 02445, where we occupy approximately 800 square feet. This space is adequate for our present and our planned future operations.

    "item_8": "ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\nContents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Worlds, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Worlds, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related statements of operations, stockholders\u2019 deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continues as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in past years, the Company has suffered net losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management\u2019s plans regarding those matters are discussed in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nNote Receivable Related Party\nThe Company loaned a material amount of money to a related party that they have asserted was within the normal course of business for a future business transaction. The note is convertible into common stock of another related party company. Management\u2019s position on the legality of this payment and the realizability of the asset are inherently riskier and more complex than they would be had this been an arm\u2019s length transaction. We evaluated the evidence provided by management for the business purpose of this loan and the current valuation of the stock that this asset is convertible into. There is a large reliance on managements representations about this transaction. Notes receivable related party is discussed in Notes 7 & 11 to the financial statements.\nGoing Concern\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company had a going concern due to a working capital deficiency and stockholders\u2019 deficiency. Auditing management\u2019s evaluation of a going concern can be a significant judgment given the fact that the Company uses management estimates on future revenues and expenses, which are not able to be substantiated. To evaluate the appropriateness of the going concern, we examined and evaluated the financial information that was the initial cause along with management\u2019s plans to mitigate the going concern and management\u2019s disclosure on going concern.\nM&K CPAS, PLLC\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2018.\nHouston, TX\nMarch 16, 2021\nContents\nContents\nContents\nContents\nContents\nWorlds, Inc.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nNOTE 1 - GOING CONCERN\nAs reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has a working capital deficiency of $2,669,888 and a stockholder\u2019s deficiency of $2,669,888 and used $1,082,023 of cash in operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nManagement believes that the actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.\nContents\nNOTE 2 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDescription of Business\nOn May 16, 2011, the Company transferred, through a spin-off to its then wholly owned subsidiary, Worlds Online Inc. (currently called MariMed Inc.), the majority of its operations and related operational assets. The Company retained its patent portfolio which it intends to continue to increase and to more aggressively enforce against alleged infringers.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\"). The Company has incurred significant losses since its inception and has had minimal revenues from operations. The Company will require substantial additional funds for development and enforcement of its patent portfolio. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the substantial additional capital resources to pursue its business plan or that any assumptions relating to its business plan will prove to be accurate. The Company has not been able to generate sufficient revenue or obtain sufficient financing which has had a material adverse effect on the Company, including requiring the Company to reduce operations. As the Company has focused its attention on increasing its patent portfolio and enforcing it, the Company has been operating at a reduced capacity, with only one employee and using consultants to perform any additional work that may be required.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents includes highly liquid money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606. There was no impact in adopting ASC 606 as the Company has no revenue at this time. In the second quarter of 2011, the Company spun off its online businesses to MariMed Inc. The Company\u2019s sources of revenue after the spinoff was expected to be from sublicenses of the patented technology by Worlds Online and any revenue that may be generated from enforcing its patents. The Company recognizes revenue by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are charged to operations as incurred.\nContents\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from three to five years. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense in the period incurred.\nImpairment of Long Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of its fixed assets and other assets in accordance with section 360-10-15 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Disclosure requires recognition of impairment of long-lived assets in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds its expected cash flows. If so, it is considered to be impaired and is written down to fair value, which is determined based on either discounted future cash flows or appraised values. The Company adopted the statement on inception. No impairments of these types of assets were recognized during 2019 and 2018.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method following the guidance set forth in section 718-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosure about Stock-Based Compensation. This section requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.\nContents\nNotes Payable\nThe Company has $773,279 in short term notes outstanding at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. These are old notes payable for which the statute of limitations has passed and therefore the Company does not expect it will ever have to repay those notes.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe Company reports comprehensive income and its components following guidance set forth by section 220-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification which establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. There were no items of comprehensive income (loss) applicable to the Company during the period covered in the financial statements.\nLoss Per Share\nNet loss per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB ASC. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. As of December 31, 2020, there were 11,720,000 options and 4,380,000 warrants outstanding and as of December 31, 2019, there were 11,140,000 options and 4,380,000 warrants outstanding whose effect is anti-dilutive and not included in diluted net loss per share for December 31, 2020 or for December 31, 2019. The options and warrants may dilute future earnings per share.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company\u2019s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.\nLoss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon information available at this time, that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.\nDuring 2000 the Company was involved in a lawsuit relating to unpaid consulting services. In April, 2001 a judgment against the Company was rendered for approximately $205,000. As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019 the Company recorded a reserve of $205,000 for this lawsuit, which is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets.\nContents\nRisk and Uncertainties\nThe Company is subject to risks common to companies in the technology industries, including, but not limited to, litigation, development of new technological innovations and dependence on key personnel.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company did not take any uncertain tax positions and had no adjustments to unrecognized income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to the provisions of Section 740-10-25 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level.\nThe following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:\n\u2022 Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\u2022 Level 2 - Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\n\u2022 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company\u2019s assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, other receivables, accounts payable & accrued expenses, due to related party, notes payable and notes payables, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Company's convertible notes payable are measured at amortized cost.\nWarrant and option expense was measured by using level 3 valuation.\nContents\nEmbedded Conversion Features\nThe Company evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815 \u201cDerivatives and Hedging\u201d to determine whether the embedded conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. If the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment under ASC 815, the instrument is evaluated under ASC 470-20 \u201cDebt with Conversion and Other Options\u201d for consideration of any beneficial conversion feature.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income.\nFor option-based simple derivative financial instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation for employees and directors in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 718, Compensation (\u201cASC 718\u201d) as issued by the FASB. ASC 718 requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. Under the provisions of ASC 718, stock-based compensation costs are measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and are recognized as an expense over the employee\u2019s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock options are estimated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility, dividend rate, risk free interest rate and the expected life. The Company expenses stock-based compensation by using the straight-line method. In accordance with ASC 718 and, excess tax benefits realized from the exercise of stock-based awards are classified as cash flows from operating activities. All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) are recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services, as prescribed by ASC 718-10, at either the fair value of the services rendered or the instruments issued in exchange for such services, whichever is more readily determinable, using the measurement date guidelines enumerated in Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2018-07.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, \u201cLeases\u201d Topic 842, which amends the guidance in former ASC Topic 840, Leases. The new standard increases transparency and comparability most significantly by requiring the recognition by lessees of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases longer than 12 months. Under the standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For lessees, leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement. The Company adopted the new lease guidance effective January 1, 2019. The Company is not a party to any leases and therefore is not showing any asset or liability related to leases in the current period or prior periods.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nContents\nNOTE 3 - NOTES PAYABLE\nThe Company imputed interest of $76,091 on the notes during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company repaid the $600,000 in notes payable and $150,000 in notes payable related party with accrued interest totaling $189,118 during the first quarter of 2019.\nContents\nNOTE 4 - EQUITY\nAll common stock numbers and exercise prices in this Note are reflected on a post reverse split (5 to 1) basis. As a result of the reverse split on February 9, 2018, the Company had to issue an additional 167 shares due to rounding.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an option expense of $267,647 representing the amortization of the value of the options issued in 2020 and 2018 that have not yet vested.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an option expense of $309,783 representing the amortization of the value of the options issued in 2018 that have not yet vested.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued 700,000 options. 300,000 options were issued to Chris Ryan, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and 400,000 options were issued to Directors of the Company. The Company recorded an option expense of $267,647 in 2020. $256,574 of this amount relates to the 2018 grant to Mr. Kidrin, the CEO. $11,073 relates to the grant in 2020 to Mr. Ryan, the CFO. The directors\u2019 options were granted on December 31, 2020 and no expense was recorded for these options. The option expense represents the amortization of the value of the options issued in 2020 and 2018 that have not yet vested. The fair market value for Mr. Ryan\u2019s options was calculated using the Black Scholes method assuming a risk free interest of .36%, 0% dividend yield, volatility of 204%, and an exercise price of $0.266 per share with a market price of $0.266 per share at issuance date and an expected life of 5 years. The options vest one year from the date of grant.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an option expense of $309,783, equal to the increase in estimated fair value of the unvested options at December 31, 2019.\nContents\nNOTE 5 - INCOME TAXES\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $45,000,000 that expire in various years through the year 2040.\nDue to net operating loss carry forwards and operating losses, there is no provision for current federal or state income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount used for federal and state income tax purposes.\nThe Company\u2019s deferred tax asset at December 31, 2020 consists of net operating loss carry forwards calculated using federal and state effective tax rates equating to approximately $17,131,179 less a valuation allowance in the amount of approximately $17,131,179. Because of the Company\u2019s lack of earnings history, the deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $338,288 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and increased by approximately $240,419 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe Company\u2019s total deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nThe reconciliation of income taxes computed at the federal and state statutory income tax rate to total income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nOn December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among others. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax asset and liabilities.

    "item_9": "ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nThe Company was informed by its independent registered public accounting firm, L&L CPAs, P.A. (\u201cL&L\u201d), of its intent to resign for reason that it would not be able to comply with Section 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which prohibit a registered public accounting firm from providing audit services to an issuer if the audit partner having primary responsibility for the audit, or the audit partner responsible for reviewing the audit, has performed audit services for that issuer in each of the five previous fiscal years of that issuer. Consequently, on December 12, 2018, L&L resigned as the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm.\nOn December 12, 2018, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors engaged M&K CPAs, PLLC (\u201cM&K\u201d) as the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019.",
    "item_9A": "ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur principal executive officer and principal financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nFurthermore, smaller reporting companies may face additional limitations. Smaller reporting companies often employ fewer individuals and find it difficult to properly segregate duties. Often, one or two individuals control every aspect of the Company\u2019s operation and are in a position to override any system of internal control. Additionally, smaller reporting companies may utilize general accounting software packages that lack a rigorous set of software controls.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a- 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act, as amended. Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified the following material weaknesses:\n1. As of December 31, 2020, we did not maintain effective controls over the control environment. The Board of Directors does not currently have any director that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\n2. As of December 31, 2020, we did not maintain effective controls over financial statement disclosure. Specifically, controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our financial statements. Accordingly, management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.\n3. As of December 31, 2020, we did not establish a formal written policy for the approval, identification and authorization of related party transactions.\nBecause of these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on the criteria established in \u201cInternal Control-Integrated Framework\u201d issued by the COSO.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2020, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.",

Pursuant to Section 3(a)(58)(B) of the Exchange Act, the entire Board of Directors acts as an audit committee for the purpose of overseeing the accounting and financial reporting processes, and audits of our financial statements. The Commission recently adopted new regulations relating to audit committee composition and functions, including disclosure requirements relating to the presence of an \"audit committee financial expert\" serving on its audit committee. We are not in a position at this time to attract, retain and compensate additional directors in order to acquire a director who qualifies as an \"audit committee financial expert\" or to so designate one of our current directors, but we intend to either retain an additional director who will qualify as such an expert or designate one of our current directors as such an expert, as soon as reasonably practicable. Our current directors, by virtue of their past employment experience, have considerable knowledge of financial statements, finance, and accounting, and have significant employment experience involving financial oversight responsibilities. Accordingly, we believe that our current directors capably fulfill the duties and responsibilities of an audit committee in the absence of such a designated expert at this time.\nCode of Ethics\nWe have adopted a code of ethic (the \"Code of Ethics\") that applies to our principal chief executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. A copy of the Code of Ethics was filed as Exhibit 14.1 to a previous annual report. The Code of Ethics is being designed with the intent to deter wrongdoing, and to promote the following:\n\u2022 Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships\n\u2022 Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that we file with, or submit to, the Commission and in other public communications we make\n\u2022 Compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations\n\u2022 The prompt internal reporting of violations of the code to an appropriate person or persons identified in the code\n\u2022 Accountability for adherence to the code\nSection 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance\nUnder Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, all executive officers, directors, and each person who is the beneficial owner of more than 10% of the common stock of a company that files reports pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, are required to report the ownership of such common stock, options, and stock appreciation rights (other than certain cash-only rights) and any changes in that ownership with the Commission. Specific due dates for these reports have been established, and we are required to report, in this Form 10-K, any failure to comply therewith during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. We believe that all of these filing requirements were satisfied by its executive officers, directors and by the beneficial owners of more than 10% of our common stock except that each director did not file one Form 4.

Mr. Ryan\u2019s compensation in 2019 includes a portion of deferred compensation from previous years.\nStock Option Grants\nThe following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2020 concerning unexercised options, unvested stock and equity incentive plan awards on a post reverse split 5 for 1 basis for the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table.\nOUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS AT YEAR-ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020\nCompensation of Directors\nOn September 5, 2007, the Board of Directors adopted a compensation program for the directors whereby each director will receive compensation in the form of stock options for serving on the board. Five-year non-qualified stock options to purchase 100,000 shares of the Corporation\u2019s common stock are to be granted annually on January 1 to each director then in office at an exercise price equal to the last reported trading price of our common stock on that day, with such option to vest in 12 months, provided the director serves for at least six months, following the date of grant. In addition, every director upon first joining our board receives 150,000 stock options that vest immediately and are exercisable for five years at a price equal to the last reported trading price of our common stock on that day.\nThe following table sets forth information concerning the compensation paid to each of our non-employee directors during 2020 for their services rendered as directors.\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\n(1) This column represents the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the 2020 fiscal year for the fair value of stock options granted to the named director in fiscal year 2020, in accordance with SFAS 123R. Pursuant to SEC rules, the amounts shown exclude the impact of estimated forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions. These amounts reflect our accounting expense for these awards, and do not correspond to the actual value that will be recognized from these awards by the named director.\nEmployment Agreements\nThe Company is committed to an employment agreement with its President and CEO, Thom Kidrin. The agreement, dated as of August 28, 2018, is for five years with a one-year renewal option held by Mr. Kidrin. Mr. Kidrin exercised his one-year renewal option. The agreement provides for a base salary of $200,000, which increases 10% on September 1 of each year; a monthly car allowance of $500; an annual bonus equal to 2.5% of Pre-Tax Income (as defined in the agreement); an additional bonus as follows: $75,000, if Pre-Tax Income for the year is between 150% and 200% of the prior fiscal year\u2019s Pre-Tax Income or (B) $100,000, if Pre-Tax Income for the year is between 201% and 250% of the prior fiscal year\u2019s Pre-Tax Income or (C) $200,000, if Pre-Tax Income for the year is 251% or greater than the prior fiscal year\u2019s Pre-Tax Income, but in no event shall this additional bonus exceed five (5%) percent of Pre-Tax Income for such year; payment of up to $10,000 in life insurance premiums; options to purchase 5 million shares of Worlds Inc. common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share, 2 million shares vested on August 28, 2018, 1.5 million shares vest on August 28, 2019 and 1.5 million shares vest on August 28, 2020; a death benefit of at least $2 million dollars; and a payment equal to 2.99 times his base amount (as defined in the agreement) in the event of a Change of Control (as defined in the agreement). The agreement also provides that Mr. Kidrin can be terminated for cause (as defined in the agreement) and that he is subject to restrictive covenants for 12 months after termination.\nStock Option Plan\nOn September 4, 2007, our board of directors adopted the 2007 Stock Option Plan which was presented to our shareholders for their approval at an annual meeting. The plan provides for the issuance of up to 25 million options of which not more than 22 million can be incentive stock options.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nOne of our directors currently hold the same position with our former subsidiary, Worlds Online Inc. (currently named MariMed Inc.), although it is the intent that our current non-employee directors will only serve during a transition period not to exceed 12 months that transition has extended longer than initially anticipated. In addition, our CEO was the CEO of MariMed from inception in 2011 until July 20, 2017 when he was replace by another of our directors and our CFO was the CFO of MariMed from inception in 2011 until July 20, 2017. We do not have a compensation committee and all of our directors perform the function of a compensation committee, except that Mr. Kidrin, our president and CEO, does not participate in any deliberations with respect to his compensation and physically removes himself from the presence of the other directors while they deliberate over his compensation and bonuses. Accordingly, Mr. Kidrin, who is both our president and CEO and was a director of MariMed Inc. until June 2019, and until July 20, 2017 was also its CEO and Mr. Fireman who is one of our directors and is a director of MariMed Inc. and its CEO since July 20, 2017 may be deemed to fall within the parameters of a compensation committee interlock. To address this situation, as described above, Mr. Kidrin recuses himself from all deliberations of the board with respect to his compensation.\nSECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS ON A POST REVERSE SPLIT (5:1) BASIS",

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.\nWe are not currently subject to the requirements of any stock exchange or inter-dealer quotation system with respect to having a majority of \u201cindependent directors\u201d although we believe that we meet that standard inasmuch as Messrs. Stolar, Fireman Toboroff and Christos are \u201cindependent\u201d and only Mr. Kidrin, by virtue of being our president and CEO, is not independent. Although we are not currently subject to such rule, the independence of our directors meets the definition of such term as contained in NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2).\nWe currently own less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of our former wholly-owned subsidiary, MariMed Inc., and its current CEO and Director is also a Director of the Company, although it is the intent that this non-employee director will only serve during a transition period.",
    "item_14": "ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.\nFees Billed For Audit and Non-Audit Services\nThe following table represents the aggregate fees billed for professional audit services rendered by the independent auditors, M&K CPAS PLLC (\u201cM&K\u201d), for our audit of the annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. M&K was retained on December 12, 2018 after the Company was informed by L&L of its intent to resign for reason that it would not be able to comply with Section 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which prohibit a registered public accounting firm from providing audit services to an issuer if the audit partner having primary responsibility for the audit, or the audit partner responsible for reviewing the audit, has performed audit services for that issuer in each of the five previous fiscal years of that issuer. L&L (then operating under its previous name) was retained as our auditor in 2007. Audit fees and other fees of auditors are listed as follows:\n(1) Audit Fees. These are fees for professional services for the audit of our annual financial statements, and for the review of the financial statements included in our filings on Form 10-Q, and for services that are normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements.\n(2) The amounts shown for the audit firms in 2020 and 2019 relate to (i) the audit of our annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and (ii) the review of the financial statements included in our filings on Form 10-Q for the first, second and third quarters of 2020 and 2019.\n(3) Audit-Related Fees. These are fees for the assurance and related services reasonably related to the performance of the audit or the review of our financial statements.\n(4) Tax Fees. These are fees for professional services with respect to tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning.\n(5) All Other Fees. These are fees for permissible work that does not fall within any of the other fee categories, i.e., Audit Fees, Audit-Related Fees, or Tax Fees.\nPre-Approval Policy For Audit and Non-Audit Services\nWe do not have a standing audit committee, and the full Board performs all functions of an audit committee, including the pre-approval of all audit and non-audit services before we engage an accountant. All of the services rendered to us by M&K CPAS PLLC and L&L CPAS, P.A. were pre-approved by our Board of Directors.\nWe are presently working with our legal counsel to establish formal pre-approval policies and procedures for future engagements of our accountants. The new policies and procedures will be detailed as to the particular service, will require that the Board or an audit committee thereof be informed of each service, and will prohibit the delegation of pre-approval responsibilities to management. It is currently anticipated that our new policy will provide (i) for an annual pre-approval, by the Board or audit committee, of all audit, audit-related and non-audit services proposed to be rendered by the independent auditor for the fiscal year, as specifically described in the auditor's engagement letter, and (ii) that additional engagements of the auditor, which were not approved in the annual pre-approval process, and engagements that are anticipated to exceed previously approved thresholds, will be presented on a case-by-case basis, by the President, for pre-approval by the Board or audit committee, before management engages the auditors for any such purposes. The new policy and procedures may authorize the Board or audit committee to delegate, to one or more of its members, the authority to pre-approve certain permitted services, provided that the estimated fee for any such service does not exceed a specified dollar amount (to be determined). All pre-approvals shall be contingent on a finding, by the Board, audit committee, or delegate, as the case may be, that the provision of the proposed services is compatible with the maintenance of the auditor's independence in the conduct of its auditing functions. In no event shall any non-audit related service be approved that would result in the independent auditor no longer being considered independent under the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
