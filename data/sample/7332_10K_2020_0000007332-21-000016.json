    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nSouthwestern Energy Company (including its subsidiaries, collectively, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, \u201cthe Company\u201d or \u201cSouthwestern\u201d) is an independent energy company engaged in exploration, development and production activities, including the related marketing of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids (\u201cNGLs\u201d) produced in our operations. Southwestern is a holding company whose assets consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and whose business is conducted substantially through, its subsidiaries. Currently we operate exclusively in the United States. Our common stock is listed and traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol \u201cSWN.\u201d\nSouthwestern, which is incorporated in Delaware, has its executive offices located at 10000 Energy Drive, Spring, Texas 77389, and can be reached by phone at 832-796-1000. The Company also maintains offices in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania, Morgantown, West Virginia, and Zanesville, Ohio.\nOur Business Strategy\nWe aim to deliver sustainable and industry-leading returns through excellence in exploration and production and marketing performance from our extensive resource base and targeted expansion of our activities and assets along the hydrocarbon value chain. Our Company\u2019s formula embodies our corporate philosophy and guides how we operate our business:\nOur formula, \u201cThe Right People doing the Right Things, wisely investing the cash flow from our underlying Assets will create Value+,\u201d also guides our business strategy. We always strive to attract and retain strong talent, to work safely and act ethically with unwavering vigilance for the environment and the communities in which we operate, and to creatively apply technical skills, which we believe will grow long-term value for our shareholders. The arrow in our formula is not a straight line: we acknowledge that factors may adversely affect quarter-by-quarter results, but the path over time points to value creation.\nIn applying these core principles, we concentrate on:\n\u2022Financial Strength. We are committed to rigorously managing our balance sheet and financial risks. We budget and dynamically manage our operations in order to ensure that our investments do not exceed our cash flow from operations (net of changes in working capital) in each calendar year, protect our projected cash flows through hedging and continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity. Our capital investment program in 2020 was supplemented with the remaining earmarked proceeds from the sale of our Fayetteville Shale assets in December 2018.\n\u2022Increasing Margins. We apply strong technical, operational, commercial and marketing skills to reduce costs, improve the productivity of our wells and pursue commercial arrangements to extract greater value. We believe our demonstrated ability to maximize margins, especially by leveraging the scale of our large assets, gives us a competitive advantage as we move into the future.\n\u2022Exercising Capital Allocation Discipline. We continually assess market conditions in order to adjust our capital allocation decisions to maximize shareholder returns. This allocation process includes consideration of multiple alternatives including but not limited to the development of our natural gas and oil assets, strategic mergers or acquisitions, reducing debt and returning capital to our shareholders.\n\u2022Operational Value Creation. We prepare an economic analysis for our drilling programs and other investments based upon the expected Internal Rate of Return. We target projects that generate the highest returns in excess of our cost of capital. This disciplined investment approach governs our investment decisions at all times, including the current lower-price commodity market.\n\u2022Dynamic Management of Assets Throughout Life Cycle. We own large-scale, long-life assets in various phases of development. In early stages, we ramp up development through technical, operational and commercial skills, and as they grow we look for ways to maximize their value through efficient operating practices along with applying our commercial and marketing expertise.\n\u2022Deepening Our Inventory. We continue to expand the inventory of properties that we can develop profitably by converting our extensive resources into proved reserves, targeting additions whose productivity largely has been demonstrated and improving efficiencies in production.\n\u2022The Hydrocarbon Value Chain. We believe that our vertical integration enhances our margins and provides us competitive advantages. For example, we own and operate drilling rigs and well stimulation equipment and have invested in a water transportation project in West Virginia. These activities provide operational flexibility, lower our well costs, minimize the risk associated with the lack of availability of these resources from third parties and capture additional value over time.\n\u2022Technological Innovation. Our people constantly search for the next revolutionary technology and other operational advancements to capture greater value in unconventional hydrocarbon resource development. These developments - whether single, step-changing technologies or a combination of several incremental ones - can reduce finding and development costs and thus increase our margins.\n\u2022Environmental Solutions and Policy Formation. We are a leader in identifying and implementing innovative solutions to unconventional hydrocarbon development to minimize the environmental and community impacts of our activities. We work extensively with governmental, non-governmental and industry stakeholders to develop responsible and cost-effective programs. We demonstrate that a company can operate responsibly and profitably, putting us in a better position to comply with new regulations as they evolve.\nDuring 2020 we executed on these business strategies by:\n\u2022Expanding our portfolio in Appalachia by acquiring Montage Resources Corporation through an accretive all-stock transaction, increasing our economic inventory while recognizing immediate cost structure savings;\n\u2022Dynamically managing our operational focus from liquids to dry gas in response to adverse economic conditions, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to take advantage of more favorable commodity pricing;\n\u2022Lowering our costs through drilling, completions and operational efficiencies and optimizing gathering and transportation costs;\n\u2022Continuing to identify and implement structural, process and organizational changes to further reduce general and administrative costs;\n\u2022Maintaining a robust multi-year hedging program to ensure a certain level of cash flow;\n\u2022Focusing on delivering operational excellence with improved well productivity and economics from enhanced completion techniques, innovative water sourcing, optimization of surface equipment and managing reservoir drawdown;\n\u2022Repurchasing approximately $107 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for $72 million, recognizing a gain on the extinguishment of debt of $35 million; and\n\u2022Publishing our 7th Annual Corporate Responsibility report for 2019 (available at www.swn.com). Key environmental highlights include:\n\u25e6We reported the lowest greenhouse gas intensity among our Appalachian peers in the annual Environmental Health and Safety Survey;\n\u25e6Our methane intensity was 85% better than the target set by ONE Future (a coalition of 37 natural gas companies working together to voluntarily lower methane emissions); and\n\u25e6We were fresh water neutral for the fifth year in a row; 100% of our fresh water usage was offset through recycling and conservation projects.\nNote that the information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this filing.\nThe bulk of our operations, which we refer to as \u201cExploration and Production\u201d (\u201cE&P\u201d), are focused on the finding and development of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value through our marketing business, which we refer to as \u201cMarketing.\u201d\nExploration and Production\nOverview\nOur primary business is the exploration for, and production of, natural gas, oil and NGLs, with our current operations solely within the United States. We are currently focused on the development of unconventional natural gas reservoirs located in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. Our operations in northeast Pennsylvania (herein referred to as \u201cNortheast Appalachia\u201d) are primarily focused on the unconventional natural gas reservoir known as the Marcellus Shale, and our operations in West Virginia, southwest Pennsylvania and Ohio (herein referred to as \u201cSouthwest Appalachia\u201d) are focused on the Marcellus Shale, the Utica and the Upper Devonian unconventional natural gas, oil and NGL reservoirs. Collectively, our properties located in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia are herein referred to as \u201cAppalachia.\u201d\n\u2022Our E&P segment recorded operating loss of $2,864 million in 2020, compared to operating income of $283 million in 2019. Our E&P segment operating income (loss) decreased $3,147 million in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to $2,825 million of non-cash full cost ceiling test impairments. Excluding the impact of ceiling test impairments, operating income (loss) decreased $322 million compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to lower margins associated with decreased commodity pricing.\n\u2022Our cash flow from operations was $372 million in 2020, compared to $781 million in 2019. This $409 million decrease was primarily due to a 20% decrease in weighted average commodity prices, including derivatives, partially offset by a 13% increase in production volumes.\nOilfield Services Vertical Integration\nWe provide certain oilfield services that are strategic and economically beneficial for our E&P operations when our E&P activity levels and market pricing support these activities. This vertical integration lowers our well costs, allows us to operate efficiently, provides agility to our operations allowing us to react quickly to rapid changes in market conditions and helps us to mitigate certain operational and environmental risks. These services include drilling, completions and water management and movement. As of December 31, 2020, we operated a fleet of drilling rigs and leased two pressure pumping spreads with a total capacity of 72,000 horsepower. These assets provide us greater flexibility to align our operational activities with commodity prices. In 2020, we provided drilling rigs for all of our 98 drilled wells. In addition, we provided completions services utilizing one pressure pumping spread in Southwest Appalachia.\nOur Proved Reserves\n(1)Our existing tax attributes, including net operating losses and remaining depreciable tax basis related to our natural gas and oil properties, more than offset our future net operating income, resulting in no tax effect to our PV-10 calculation for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOur reserve estimates and the after-tax PV-10 measure, or standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserve quantities, are highly dependent upon the respective commodity price used in our reserve and after-tax PV-10 calculations.\n\u2022Our reserves decreased 6% in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in commodity pricing, partially offset by the reserves acquired from Montage.\n\u2022Our after-tax PV-10 value decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 as lower reserve levels resulted primarily from a decrease in SEC 12-month backward-looking commodity prices.\n\u2022We are the designated operator of approximately 97% of our reserves, based on the pre-tax PV-10 value of our proved developed producing reserves, and our reserve life index was approximately 11.3 years at year-end 2020, using an estimate of full year production from our recently acquired Montage properties.\nThe following table presents the PV-10 value of our reported year-end 2020 reserves balance using SEC 12-month backward-looking prices and the 12-month forward-looking strip prices as of January 4, 2021:\n(1)Adjusted for market differentials.\nThe difference in after-tax PV-10 and pre-tax PV-10 (a non-GAAP measure which is reconciled in the 2020 Proved Reserves by Category and Summary Operating Data table below) is the discounted value of future income taxes on the estimated cash flows. Our existing tax attributes, including net operating losses and remaining depreciable tax basis related to our natural gas and oil properties, more than offset our future net operating income, resulting in no tax effect to our PV-10 calculation for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe believe that the pre-tax PV-10 value of the estimated cash flows related to our estimated proved reserves is a useful supplemental disclosure to the after-tax PV-10 value. Pre-tax PV-10 is based on prices, costs and discount factors that are comparable from company to company, while the after-tax PV-10 is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company. We understand that securities analysts use pre-tax PV-10 as one measure of the value of a company\u2019s current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes. We refer you to \u201cSupplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures\u201d in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for a discussion of our standardized measure of discounted future cash flows related to our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves, to the risk factor \u201cOur proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are estimates that include uncertainties. Any material change to these uncertainties or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated\u201d in",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nNatural gas, oil and NGL prices greatly affect our revenues and thus profits, liquidity, growth, ability to repay our debt and the value of our assets.\nOur revenues, profitability, liquidity, growth, ability to repay our debt and the value of our assets greatly depend on prices for natural gas, oil and NGLs. The markets for these commodities are volatile, and we expect that volatility to continue. The prices of natural gas, oil and NGLs fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand (global, regional and local), transportation costs, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control. Short- and long-term prices are subject to a myriad of factors such as:\n\u2022overall demand, including the relative cost of competing sources of energy or fuel;\n\u2022overall supply, including costs of production;\n\u2022the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, other transportation facilities and gathering, processing and storage facilities;\n\u2022regional basis differentials;\n\u2022national and worldwide economic and political conditions;\n\u2022weather conditions and seasonal trends;\n\u2022government regulations, such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls;\n\u2022inventory levels; and\n\u2022market perceptions of future prices, whether due to the foregoing factors or others.\nFor example, in 2020 and 2019, the NYMEX settlement price for natural gas ranged from a low of $1.50 per MMBtu in July 2020 to a high of $3.64 per MMBtu in January 2019, and during this period our production was 79% and 78% natural gas, respectively. NGLs represent a growing part of our business, and in the same period settlement prices for ethane and propane, our two principal NGL products, ranged from $5.25 per Bbl in March 2020 to $13.00 per Bbl in February 2019 and $12.32 per Bbl in March 2020 to $28.22 per Bbl in February 2019, respectively. Although we hedge a large portion of our production against changing prices, derivatives do not protect all our future volumes, may result in our forgoing profit opportunities if markets rise and, for NGLs, are not always available for substantial periods into the future. In 2020, we received $362 million, net of amounts we paid, in settlement of hedging arrangements. Moreover, when market expectations of future prices fall, as they did in 2020, the prices at which we can hedge are lower, reducing future revenue.\nLower natural gas, oil and NGL prices directly reduce our revenues and thus our operating income and cash flow. Lower prices also reduce the projected profitability of further drilling and therefore are likely to reduce our drilling activity, which in turn means we will have fewer wells on production in the future. Lower prices also reduce the value of our assets, both by a direct reduction in what the production would be worth and by making some properties uneconomic, resulting in non-cash impairments to the recorded value of our reserves and non-cash charges to earnings. For example, in 2020, we reported non-cash impairment charges on our natural gas and oil properties totaling $2,825 million, primarily resulting from decreases in trailing 12-month average first-day-of-the-month natural gas prices throughout 2020, as compared to 2019, and the non-cash impairment of certain undeveloped leasehold interests. Further non-cash impairments in future periods could occur if the trailing 12-month commodity prices decrease as compared to the average used in prior periods.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $3.2 billion of debt outstanding, consisting principally of senior notes maturing in various increments from 2022 to 2028, and $700 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which matures in 2024. At current commodity price levels, our net cash flow from operations is substantially higher than our interest obligations under this debt, but significant drops in realized prices could affect our ability to pay our current obligations or refinance our debt as it becomes due.\nMoreover, general industry conditions may make it difficult or costly to refinance increments of this debt as it matures. Although our indentures do not contain significant covenants restricting our operations and other activities, our bank credit agreements contain financial covenants with which we must comply. We refer you to the risk factor \u201cOur current and future levels of indebtedness may adversely affect our results and limit our growth.\u201d Our inability to pay our current obligations or refinance our debt as it becomes due could have a material and adverse effect on our company. The drop in prices since 2014 has reduced our revenues, profits and cash flow, caused us to record significant non-cash asset impairments and led us to reduce both our level of capital investing and our workforce, which has caused us to incur significant expenses relating to employee terminations. Further price decreases could have similar consequences. Similarly, a rise in prices to levels experienced before 2015 could significantly increase our revenues, profits and cash flow, which could be used to expand capital investments.\nSignificant capital investment is required to replace our reserves and conduct our business.\nOur activities require substantial capital investment, not only to expand revenues but also because production from existing wells and thus revenues declines each year. We intend to fund our future capital investing through net cash flows from operations, net of changes in working capital. Our ability to generate operating cash flow is subject to many of the risks and uncertainties that exist in our industry, some of which we may not be able to anticipate at this time. Future cash flows from operations are subject to a number of risks and variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of natural gas, oil and NGLs, our success in developing and producing new reserves and the other risk factors discussed herein. If we are unable to fund capital investing, we could experience a further reduction in drilling new wells, acquiring new acreage and a loss of existing leased acreage, resulting in a decline in our cash flow from operations and natural gas, oil and NGL production and reserves.\nIf we are not able to replace reserves, our production levels and thus our revenues and profits may decline.\nProduction levels from existing wells decline over time, and drilling new wells requires an inventory of leases and other rights with reserves that have not yet been drilled. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional natural gas, oil and NGL reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development, acquisition or exploration activities, our proved reserves and production will decline over time. Identifying and exploiting new reserves requires significant capital investment and successful drilling operations. Thus, our future natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and production, and therefore our revenues and profits, are highly dependent on our level of capital investments, our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves.\nOur business depends on access to natural gas, oil and NGL transportation systems and facilities. Our commitments to assure availability of transportation could lead to substantial payments for capacity we do not use if production falls below projected levels.\nThe marketability of our natural gas, oil and NGL production depends in large part on the operation, availability, proximity, capacity and expansion of transportation systems and facilities owned by third parties. For example, we can provide no assurance that sufficient transportation capacity will exist for expected production from Appalachia or that we will be able to obtain sufficient transportation capacity on economic terms. During the past few years, several planned pipelines intended to service production in the Northeast United States have experienced delays in their in-service dates due to regulatory delays and litigation.\nProducers compete by lowering their sales prices, resulting in the locational differences from NYMEX pricing. Further, a lack of available capacity on transportation systems and facilities or delays in their planned expansions could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans for properties. A lack of availability of these systems and facilities for an extended period of time could negatively affect our revenues. In addition, we have entered into contracts for firm transportation and any failure to renew those contracts on the same or better commercial terms could increase our costs and our exposure to the risks described above.\nWe have entered into gathering agreements in producing areas and multiple long-term firm transportation agreements relating to natural gas volumes from all our producing areas. As of December 31, 2020, our aggregate demand charge commitments under these firm transportation agreements and gathering agreements were approximately $8.5 billion. If our development programs fail to produce sufficient quantities of natural gas and ethane to fill the contracted capacity within expected timeframes, we would be required to pay demand or other charges for transportation on pipelines and gathering systems for capacity that we would not be fully utilizing. In those situations, which have occurred on a small scale at various times, we endeavor to sell or transfer that capacity to others or fill the excess capacity with production purchased from third parties. There can be no assurance that these measures will recoup the full cost of the unused transportation.\nStrategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging in the face of shifting market conditions, and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our future growth rate.\nWe necessarily must consider future price and cost environments when deciding how much capital we are likely to have available from net cash flow and how best to allocate it. Our current philosophy is to generally operate within cash flow from operations, net of changes in working capital, and to invest capital in a portfolio of projects that are projected to generate the highest combined Internal Rate of Return. Volatility in prices and potential errors in estimating costs, reserves or timing of production of the reserves can result in uneconomic projects or economic projects generating less than anticipated returns.\nCertain of our undeveloped assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\nApproximately 19,242 and 68,825 net acres of our Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia acreage, respectively, will expire in the next three years if we do not drill successful wells to develop the acreage or otherwise take action to extend the leases. Our ability to drill wells depends on a number of factors, including certain factors that are beyond our control, such as the ability to obtain permits on a timely basis or to compel landowners or lease holders on adjacent properties to cooperate. Further, we may not have sufficient capital to drill all the wells necessary to hold the acreage without increasing our debt levels, or given price projections at the time, drilling may not be projected to achieve a sufficient return or be judged to be the best use of our capital. To the extent we do not drill the wells, our rights to acreage can be lost.\nNatural gas and oil drilling and producing and transportation operations can be hazardous and may expose us to liabilities.\nDrilling and production operations are subject to many risks, including well blowouts, cratering and explosions, pipe failures, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids, severe weather, natural disasters, groundwater contamination and other environmental hazards and risks. Some of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses by reducing or shutting in production from wells, loss of equipment or otherwise negatively impacting the projected economic performance of our prospects. If any of these risks occurs, we could sustain substantial losses as a result of:\n\u2022injury or loss of life;\n\u2022severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources or equipment;\n\u2022pollution or other environmental damage;\n\u2022clean-up responsibilities;\n\u2022regulatory investigations and administrative, civil and criminal penalties; and\n\u2022injunctions resulting in limitation or suspension of operations.\nFor our properties that we do not operate, we depend on the operator for operational and regulatory compliance.\nWe rely on third parties to transport our production to markets. Their operations, and thus our ability to reach markets, are subject to all of the risks and operational hazards inherent in transporting natural gas and ethane and natural gas compression, including:\n\u2022damages to pipelines, facilities and surrounding properties caused by third parties, severe weather, natural disasters, including hurricanes, and acts of terrorism;\n\u2022maintenance, repairs, mechanical or structural failures;\n\u2022damages to, loss of availability of and delays in gaining access to interconnecting third-party pipelines;\n\u2022disruption or failure of information technology systems and network infrastructure due to various causes, including unauthorized access or attack; and\n\u2022leaks of natural gas or ethane as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities.\nA material event such as those described above could expose us to liabilities, monetary penalties or interruptions in our business operations. Although we may maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above, our insurance may not be adequate to cover casualty losses or liabilities, and our insurance does not cover penalties or fines that may be\nassessed by a governmental authority. Also, in the future we may not be able to obtain insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase.\nWe have made significant investments in oilfield service businesses, including our drilling rigs, water infrastructure and pressure pumping equipment, to lower costs and secure inputs for our operations and transportation for our production. If our development and production activities are curtailed or disrupted, we may not recover our investment in these activities, which could adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, our continued expansion of these operations may adversely impact our relationships with third-party providers.\nWe also have made investments to meet certain of our field services\u2019 needs, including establishing our own drilling rig operation, water transportation system in Southwest Appalachia and pressure pumping capability. If our level of operations is reduced for a long period, we may not be able to recover these investments. Further, our presence in these service and supply sectors, including competing with them for qualified personnel and supplies, may have an adverse effect on our relationships with our existing third-party service and resource providers or our ability to secure these services and resources from other providers.\nOur business depends on the availability of water and the ability to dispose of water. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain or dispose of water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle water after use, could adversely impact our operations. In some cases, water may need to be obtained from new sources and transported to drilling sites, resulting in increased costs. Moreover, the introduction of new environmental initiatives and regulations related to water acquisition or waste water disposal, including produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of hydrocarbons, could limit or prohibit our ability to utilize hydraulic fracturing or waste water injection control wells.\nIn addition, concerns have been raised about the potential for seismic activity to occur from the use of underground injection control wells, a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. New rules and regulations may be developed to address these concerns, possibly limiting or eliminating the ability to use disposal wells in certain locations and increasing the cost of disposal in others. We utilize third parties to dispose of waste water associated with our operations. These third parties may operate injection wells and may be subject to regulatory restrictions relating to seismicity.\nCompliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of water necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells or the disposal of water may increase our operating costs or may cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur producing properties are concentrated in the Appalachian basin, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in limited geographic areas.\nOur producing properties currently are geographically concentrated in the Appalachian basin in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. At December 31, 2020, nearly 100% of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in the Appalachian basin. As a result of this concentration in one primary region, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, state and local politics, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, availability of equipment and personnel, water shortages or interruption of the processing or transportation of natural gas, oil or NGLs.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to market natural gas, oil and NGLs, to secure trained personnel and appropriate services, to obtain additional properties and to raise capital.\nOur cost of operations is highly dependent on third-party services, and competition for these services can be significant, especially in times when commodity prices are rising. Similarly, we compete for trained, qualified personnel, and in times of lower prices for the commodities we produce, we and other companies with similar production profiles may not be able to attract and retain this talent. Our ability to acquire and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing natural gas, oil and NGLs and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and gas industry. Certain of our competitors may possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for personnel, property and services and to attract capital at lower rates. This may become more likely if prices for oil and NGLs increase faster than prices for natural gas, as natural gas comprises a greater percentage of our overall production than it does for most of the companies with whom we compete for talent.\nWe may be unable to dispose of assets on attractive terms, and may be required to retain liabilities for certain matters.\nVarious factors could materially affect our ability to dispose of assets if and when we decide to do so, including the availability of purchasers willing to purchase the assets at prices acceptable to us, particularly in times of reduced and volatile commodity prices. Sellers typically retain liabilities for certain matters. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material. Also, as is typical in divestiture transactions, third parties may be unwilling to release us from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a sale, we may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nThe elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies may be proposed in the future. These changes may include, among other proposals:\n\u2022repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for natural gas and oil properties;\n\u2022elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; and\n\u2022extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.\nThe passage of these or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws to eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES\u201d Act) was introduced to stabilize the economy during the coronavirus pandemic. The CARES Act temporarily suspends and modifies certain tax laws established by the 2017 tax reform law known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including, but not limited to, modifications to net operating loss limitations, business interest limitations and alternative minimum tax.\nWe may experience adverse or unforeseen tax consequences due to further developments affecting our deferred tax assets that could significantly affect our results.\nDeferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, represent future savings of taxes that would otherwise be paid in cash. At December 31, 2020, we had substantial amounts of net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets is dependent on the amount of future pre-tax income that we are able to generate through our operations or sale of assets. If management concludes that it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance will be recognized in the period that this conclusion is reached. In addition, limitations may exist upon use of these carryforwards in the event that a change in control of the Company occurs.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain exploration, development and production activities as well as processing of revenues and payments. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud applications and services, to process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, communicate with employees and business associates, perform compliance reporting and in many other activities related to our business. Our vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production and financial institutions are also dependent on digital technology.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business associates may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches, which could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or protected information, corruption of data or other disruptions of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.\nA cyber-attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of companies with which we deal, could disrupt our business and negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways, including:\n\u2022unauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information, strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for natural gas and oil resources;\n\u2022unauthorized access to personal identifying information of property lessors, working interest partners, employees and vendors, which could expose us to allegations that we did not sufficiently protect that information;\n\u2022data corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure could result in loss of production, or accidental discharge;\n\u2022a cyber-attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions, which could delay or halt our major development projects; and\n\u2022a cyber-attack on a third party gathering, pipeline or rail service provider could delay or prevent us from marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues.\nThese events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nTo date we have not experienced any material losses or interruptions relating to cyber-attacks; however, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nTerrorist activities could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign attacks, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. Continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the global economy in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in commodity prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic (such as COVID-19) or any other public health crisis may have material adverse effects on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn December 2019, COVID-19 was reported to have surfaced in China. The spread of this virus has caused business disruptions beginning in January 2020, including disruptions in the oil and natural gas industry. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic, and the U.S. economy began to experience pronounced effects. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, reduced global demand for oil and gas, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity markets. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, is uncertain and depends on various factors, including the demand for natural gas, oil, NGLs and other products derived from these commodities, the availability of personnel, equipment and services critical to our ability to operate our properties and the impact of potential governmental restrictions on travel, transports and operations. There is uncertainty around the extent and duration of the disruption. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health crisis adversely impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, its impact on the economy and market conditions, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Therefore, while the Company expects this matter will likely continue to impact its operations, the degree of the adverse financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about climate change, emissions, hydraulic fracturing, seismicity, oil spills and explosions of transmission lines, may lead to regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the\ncourts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business. In addition, various officials and candidates at the federal, state and local levels, including some presidential candidates, have proposed banning hydraulic fracturing altogether.\nJudicial decisions can affect our rights and obligations.\nOur ability to develop gas, oil and NGLs depends on the leases and other mineral rights we acquire and the rights of owners of nearby properties. We operate in areas where judicial decisions have not yet definitively interpreted various contractual provisions or addressed relevant aspects of property rights, nuisance and other matters that could be the source of claims against us as a developer or operator of properties. Although we plan our activities according to our expectations of these unresolved areas, based on decisions on similar issues in these jurisdictions and decisions from courts in other states that have addressed them, courts could resolve issues in ways that increase our liabilities or otherwise restrict or add costs to our operations.\nCommon stockholders will be diluted if additional shares are issued.\nWe endeavor to create value for our stockholders on a per share basis. From time to time we have issued stock to raise capital for our business, including significant offerings of new shares in 2015, 2016 and 2020. We also issue restricted stock, options and performance share units to our employees and directors as part of their compensation. In addition, we may issue additional shares of common stock, additional notes or other securities or debt convertible into common stock, to extend maturities or fund capital expenditures. If we issue additional shares of our common stock in the future, it may have a dilutive effect on our current outstanding stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and under Delaware law may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, protective provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws or the implementation by our Board of Directors of a stockholder rights plan that could deter a takeover.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness and Financing Abilities\nA downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital and our liquidity.\nActual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, could impact our ability to access debt markets in the future to refinance existing debt or obtain additional funds, affect the market value of our senior notes and increase our borrowing costs. Such ratings are limited in scope, and do not address all material risks relating to us, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency of the likelihood we will be able to repay our debt at the time the rating is issued. An explanation of the significance of each rating may be obtained from the applicable rating agency. As of February 25, 2021, our long-term issuer ratings were Ba2 by Moody\u2019s, BB- by Standard and Poor\u2019s and BB by Fitch Investor Services. There can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant.\nActual downgrades in our credit ratings may also impact our interest costs and liquidity. The interest rates under certain of our senior notes increases as credit ratings fall. Many of our existing commercial contracts contain, and future commercial contracts may contain, provisions permitting the counterparty to require increased security upon the occurrence of a downgrade in our credit rating. Providing additional security, such as posting letters of credit, could reduce our available cash or our liquidity under our revolving credit facility for other purposes. We had $233 million of letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2020. The amount of additional financial assurance would depend on the severity of the downgrade from the credit rating agencies, and a downgrade could result in a decrease in our liquidity.\nOur current and future levels of indebtedness may adversely affect our results and limit our growth.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had long-term indebtedness of $3.2 billion. The terms of the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes, our credit facilities, and the lease agreements relating to our drilling rigs, other equipment and headquarters building, which we collectively refer to as our \u201cfinancing agreements,\u201d impose restrictions on our ability and, in\nsome cases, the ability of our subsidiaries to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, which may include, without limitation, one or more of the following:\n\u2022incurring additional debt;\n\u2022redeeming stock or redeeming certain debt;\n\u2022making certain investments;\n\u2022creating liens on our assets; and\n\u2022selling assets.\nThe revolving credit facility we entered into in April 2018, as amended (our \u201c2018 credit facility\u201d), contains customary representations, warranties and covenants including, among others, the following covenants:\n\u2022a prohibition against incurring debt, subject to permitted exceptions;\n\u2022a restriction on creating liens on assets, subject to permitted exceptions;\n\u2022restrictions on mergers and asset dispositions;\n\u2022restrictions on use of proceeds, investments, transactions with affiliates, or change of principal business; and\n\u2022maintenance of the following financial covenants, commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2018:\n1.Minimum current ratio of no less than 1.00 to 1.00, whereby current ratio is defined as the Company\u2019s consolidated current assets (including unused commitments under the credit agreement, but excluding non-cash derivative assets) to consolidated current liabilities (excluding non-cash derivative obligations and current maturities of long-term debt).\n2.Maximum total net leverage ratio of no greater than 4.00 to 1.00 subsequent to June 30, 2020. Total net leverage ratio is defined as total debt less cash on hand (up to the lesser of 10% of credit limit or $150 million) divided by consolidated EBITDAX for the last four consecutive quarters. For purposes of calculating consolidated EBITDAX, the Company can include the Montage consolidated EBITDAX prior to the merger for the same rolling twelve-month period. EBITDAX, as defined in our revolving credit facility, excludes the effects of interest expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, income tax, any non-cash impacts from impairments, certain non-cash hedging activities, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash gains or losses on asset sales, unamortized issuance cost, unamortized debt discount and certain restructuring costs.\nIn conjunction with the October 2020 redetermination process, the Company entered into an amendment to the credit agreement governing the 2018 credit facility to, among other matters:\n\u2022limit the Company's unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to $200 million when loans under the 2018 credit facility are outstanding, subject to certain exceptions; and\n\u2022increase the applicable rate by 25 basis points on loans outstanding under the 2018 credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our revolving credit facility in all material respects. Our ability to comply with these financial covenants depends in part on the success of our development program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for natural gas, oil and NGLs.\nOur level of indebtedness and off-balance sheet obligations, and the covenants contained in our financing agreements, could have important consequences for our operations, including:\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital investing and other general business activities;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital investing, acquisitions and general corporate and other activities;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022detracting from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally.\nAny significant reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination.\nThe amount we may borrow under our revolving credit facility is capped at the lower of the total of our bank commitments and a \u201cborrowing base\u201d determined from time to time by the lenders based on our reserves, market conditions and other factors. As of December 31, 2020, the borrowing base and total aggregate commitments were $2.0 billion, which was most recently reaffirmed as of November 2020. The borrowing base is subject to scheduled semiannual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on our natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and other factors. As of December 31, 2020, we had $700 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and we expect to borrow under that facility in the future. As of December 31, 2020, we had $233 million of letters of credit issued under the credit facility and unused borrowing capacity was approximately $1.1 billion which exceeds our currently modeled needs. Any significant reduction in our borrowing base as a result of borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flow. Further, if the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination or other reasons, we would be required to repay the excess within a brief period. We may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. Any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in our financing agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic and financial conditions.\nFailure to comply with the covenants and other restrictions could lead to an event of default and the acceleration of our obligations under our senior notes, credit facilities or other financing agreements, and in the case of the lease agreements for drilling rigs, compressors and pressure pumping equipment, loss of use of the equipment. In particular, the occurrence of risks identified elsewhere in this section, such as declines in commodity prices, increases in basis differentials and inability to access markets, could reduce our profits and thus the cash we have to fulfill our financial obligations. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations with cash on hand, we could attempt to refinance such debt, sell assets or repay such debt with the proceeds from an equity offering. We cannot assure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, to meet our lease obligations, or that future borrowings, equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets will be available to pay or refinance such debt or obligations. The terms of our financing agreements may also prohibit us from taking such actions. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock, a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions and our market value and operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing. We cannot assure that any such proposed offering, refinancing or sale of assets can be successfully completed or, if completed, that the terms will be favorable to us.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation\nClimate change legislation or regulations governing the emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduce demand for the natural gas, oil and NGLs we produce, and concern in financial and investment markets over greenhouse gasses and fossil fuel production could adversely affect our access to capital and the price of our common stock.\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to human health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their greenhouse gas emissions also will be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that will be established on a case-by-case basis. EPA rulemakings related to greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources.\nThe EPA also has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified onshore and offshore natural gas and oil production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. In May 2016, the EPA finalized additional regulations to control methane and volatile organic compound emissions from certain oil and gas equipment and operations. However, in September 2020, the EPA finalized further amendments to the standards that removed the transmission and storage segments from the oil and natural gas source category and rescinded the methane-specific requirements for production and processing facilities. Several lawsuits were filed challenging these amendments, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ordered an administrative stay of these amendments shortly after they were finalized. Although the administrative stay was lifted in October 2020, which brought the amendments into effect, the amendments may be subject to reversal under a new presidential administration.\nAlthough Congress from time to time has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of states, including states in which we operate, have enacted or passed measures to track and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. Most of these cap-and-trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved. These reductions may cause the cost of allowances to escalate significantly over time.\nThe adoption and implementation of regulations that require reporting of greenhouse gases or otherwise limit emissions of greenhouse gases from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to monitor and report on greenhouse gas emissions or install new equipment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. In addition, these regulatory initiatives could drive down demand for our products by stimulating demand for alternative forms of energy that do not rely on combustion of fossil fuels that serve as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. At the same time, new laws and regulations are prompting power producers to shift from coal to natural gas, which is increasing demand.\nIn December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d). The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016 after more than 70 nations, including the United States, ratified or otherwise indicated their intent to be bound by the agreement. In November 2019, the United States formally initiated the process for withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, which resulted in an effective exit date of November 2020. However, in January 2021, the new administration announced that the United States intends to rejoin the Paris Agreement. To the extent that the United States and other countries implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and natural gas industry, or that investors insist on compliance regardless of legal requirements, it could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe, our service providers and our customers are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur development and production operations and the transportation of our products to market are subject to complex and stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing environmental protection, the occupational health and safety aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the protection of certain plant and animal species. See \u201cOther - Environmental Regulation\u201d in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us. These laws and regulations require us, our service providers and our customers to obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. Environmental regulations may restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that may be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit drilling or transportation activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, archeological sites and other protected areas, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations and those of our service providers and customers. Moreover, we or they may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, including as a result of government shutdowns, which may delay or interrupt our or their operations and limit our growth and revenues. In addition, various officials and candidates at the federal, state and local levels, including some presidential candidates, have proposed banning hydraulic fracturing altogether.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations can trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including investigatory actions, the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, or the issuance of orders or judgments limiting or enjoining future operations. Strict liability or joint and several liability may be imposed under certain laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions. Moreover, our costs of compliance with existing laws could be substantial and may increase or unforeseen liabilities could be imposed if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. If we are not able to recover the increased costs through insurance or increased revenues, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Financial Markets and Uncertainties\nMarket views of our industry generally can affect our stock price.\nFactors described elsewhere, including views regarding future commodity prices, regulation and climate change, can affect the amount investors choose to invest in our industry generally. Recent years have seen a significant reduction in overall investment in exploration and production companies, resulting in a drop in individual companies\u2019 stock prices. Separate from actual and possible governmental action, certain financial institutions have announced policies to cease investing or to divest\ninvestments in companies, such as ours, that produce fossil fuels, and some banks have announced they no longer will lend to companies in this sector. To date these represent small fractions of overall sources of equity and debt, but that fraction could grow and thus affect our access to capital. Moreover, some equity investors are expressing concern over these matters and may prompt companies in our industry to adopt more costly practices even absent governmental action. Although we believe our practices result in low emission rates for methane and other greenhouse gases as compared to others in our industry, complying with investor sentiment may require modifications to our practices, which could increase our capital and operating expenses.\nVolatility in the financial markets or in global economic factors could adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. Included among these potential negative impacts are reduced energy demand and lower commodity prices, including due to the possible impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19), increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers, reduced access to credit markets and the risks related to the discontinuation of LIBOR and other reference rates, including increased expenses and litigation and the effectiveness of interest rate hedge strategies. Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing. If financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures.\nAny changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in \u201ctrade wars,\u201d in increased costs for materials necessary for our industry along with other goods imported into the United States, which may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay those tariffs increase their prices, or in trading partners limiting their trade with the United States. If these consequences are realized, the volume of economic activity in the United States, including growth in sectors that utilize our products, may be materially reduced along with a reduction in the potential export of our products. Such a reduction may materially and adversely affect commodity prices, our sales and our business.\nRisks Related to the Ability of our Hedging Activities to Adequately Manage our Exposure to Commodity and Financial Risk\nOur proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are estimates that include uncertainties. Any material changes to these uncertainties or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.\nAs described in more detail under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Natural Gas and Oil Properties\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report, our reserve data represents the estimates of our reservoir engineers made under the supervision of our management, and our reserve estimates are audited each year by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., or NSAI, an independent petroleum engineering firm. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas, oil and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as using historic natural gas, oil and NGL prices rather than future projections. Additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital investing, taxes and availability of funds. Furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data.\nResults of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate. Accordingly, initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas, oil and NGLs that are ultimately recovered, and such variances may be material. Any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the preceding 12-month average natural gas, oil and NGL index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general.\nOur commodity price risk management and measurement systems and economic hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results.\nWe currently seek to hedge the price of a significant portion of our estimated production through swaps, collars, floors and other derivative instruments. The systems we use to quantify commodity price risk associated with our businesses might not always be effective. Further, such systems do not in themselves manage risk, particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets, changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks have been identified. Furthermore, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. For example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract\u2019s counterparty credit or performance risk. Therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist.\nOur use of derivatives, through which we attempt to reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity markets could result in increased volatility of our reported results. Changes in the fair values (gains and losses) of derivatives that qualify as hedges under GAAP to the extent that such hedges are not fully effective in offsetting changes to the value of the hedged commodity, as well as changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify or have not been designated as hedges under GAAP, must be recorded in our income. This creates the risk of volatility in earnings even if no economic impact to us has occurred during the applicable period. To the extent we cap or lock prices at specific levels, we would also forgo the ability to realize the higher revenues that would be realized should prices increase.\nThe impact of changes in market prices for natural gas, oil and NGLs on the average prices paid or received by us may be reduced based on the level of our hedging activities. These hedging arrangements may limit or enhance our margins if the market prices for oil, natural gas or NGLs were to change substantially from the price established by the hedges. In addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss if our production volumes are less than expected.\nThe implementation of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, including us, which participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, the SEC, and other regulatory authorities to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the CFTC has finalized most of its regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act, it continues to review and refine its initial rulemakings through additional interpretations and supplemental rulemakings. As a result, it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate effect of the rules and regulations on our business and while most of the regulations have been adopted, any new regulations or modifications to existing regulations may increase the cost of derivative contracts, limit the availability of derivatives to protect against risks that we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations thereunder, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital investing.\nIn January 2020, the CFTC proposed new amended regulations that would place federal limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. In 2016, the CFTC finalized a companion rule on aggregation of positions among entities under common ownership or control. If finalized, the position limits rule may have an impact on our ability to hedge our exposure to certain enumerated commodities.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and mandatory trading on designated contract markets or swap execution facilities. The CFTC may designate additional classes of swaps as subject to the mandatory clearing requirement in the future, but has not yet proposed rules designating any other classes of swaps, including physical commodity swaps, for mandatory clearing. The CFTC and prudential banking regulators also adopted mandatory margin requirements on uncleared swaps between swap dealers and certain other counterparties. The margin requirements are currently effective with respect to certain market participants and will be phased in over time with respect to other market participants, based on the level of an entity\u2019s swaps activity. We expect to qualify for and rely upon an end-user exception from the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks. We also should qualify for an exception from the uncleared swaps margin requirements. However, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements and the uncleared swaps margin requirement to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may adversely affect the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nSouthwestern may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger, and the Merger may disrupt its current plans or operations.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in part, on Southwestern\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining Southwestern\u2019s and Montage\u2019s businesses, and there can be no assurance that Southwestern and Montage will be able to successfully integrate or otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger. Difficulties in integrating Southwestern and Montage may result in the combined company performing differently than expected, in operational challenges, or in the failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among others:\n\u2022the inability to successfully integrate Montage in a manner that permits the achievement of full revenue, expected cash flows and cost savings anticipated from the Merger;\n\u2022not realizing anticipated operating synergies;\n\u2022integrating personnel from the two companies and the loss of key employees;\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses or delays associated with and following the completion of the Merger;\n\u2022integrating relationships with customers, vendors and business partners;\n\u2022performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by completing the Merger and integrating Montage\u2019s operations; and\n\u2022the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, Southwestern\u2019s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.",

These licenses expire in March 2021, and we fully impaired our investment in New Brunswick in 2016. We are currently working with Canadian officials to extend our licenses, although we cannot assure that the licenses will be extended past March 2021.\nLease Expirations\nThe following table summarizes the leasehold acreage expiring over the next three years, assuming successful wells are not drilled to develop the acreage and leases are not extended:\n(1)The leasehold acreage expiring includes 8,907 acres acquired through the Montage Merger that are subject to annual extension options at our sole discretion. Excluding this acreage, of the remaining leasehold acreage expiring, 17,460 net acres in 2021, 6,173 net acres in 2022 and 5,573 net acres in 2023 can be extended for an average 4.9 years.\n(2)Exploration licenses were extended through March 2021 but have been subject to a moratorium since 2015. We are currently working with Canadian officials to extend our licenses, although we cannot assure that the licenses will be extended past March 2021. We impaired their value to $0 in 2016.\nProducing wells as of December 31, 2020\nThe information regarding drilling and other exploratory and development activities required by Item 1205 of Regulation S-K is set forth below:\n(1)The Fayetteville Shale E&P assets were sold in December 2018.\n(1)The Fayetteville Shale E&P assets were sold in December 2018.\nThe following table presents the information regarding our present activities required by Item 1206 of Regulation S-K:\nWells in progress as of December 31, 2020\nThe information regarding oil and gas production, production prices and production costs required by Item 1204 of Regulation S-K is set forth below:\nProduction, Average Sales Price and Average Production Cost\n(1)The Fayetteville Shale E&P assets and associated reserves were sold in December 2018.\n(2)Approximately 878 Bcfe, 776 Bcfe and 698 Bcfe for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were produced from the Marcellus Shale formation. Approximately 243 Bcfe for the year ended December 31, 2018 was produced from the Fayetteville Shale.\nDuring 2020, we were required to file Form 23, \u201cAnnual Survey of Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves,\u201d with the U.S. Department of Energy. The basis for reporting reserves on Form 23 is not comparable to the reserve data included in \u201cSupplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures\u201d in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report. The primary differences are that Form 23 reports gross reserves, including the royalty owners\u2019 share, and includes reserves for only those properties of which we are the operator.\nTitle to Properties\nWe believe that we have satisfactory title to substantially all of our active properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry. Our properties are subject to customary royalty and overriding royalty interests, certain contracts relating to the exploration, development, operation and marketing of production from such properties, consents to assignment and preferential purchase rights, liens for current taxes, applicable laws and other burdens, encumbrances and irregularities in title, which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect the value of such properties. Prior to acquiring undeveloped properties, we endeavor to perform a title investigation that is thorough but less vigorous than that we endeavor to conduct prior to drilling, which is consistent with standard practice in the oil and natural gas industry. Generally, before we commence drilling operations on properties that we operate, we conduct a title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects that we identify. We believe that we have performed title review with respect to substantially all of our active properties that we operate.",

We accrue for such items when a liability is both probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. It is not possible at this time to estimate the amount of any additional loss, or range of loss that is reasonably possible, but based on the nature of the claims, management believes that current litigation, claims and proceedings, individually or in aggregate and after taking into account insurance, are not likely to have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, for the period in which the effect of that outcome becomes reasonably estimable. Many of these matters are in early stages, so the allegations and the damage theories have not been fully developed, and are all subject to inherent uncertainties; therefore, management\u2019s view may change in the future. If an unfavorable final outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Environmental and cleanup related costs of a non-capital nature are accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount can be reasonably estimated.

We conduct most of our businesses through subsidiaries, and we currently operate exclusively in the lower 48 United States.\nE&P. Our primary business is the exploration for and production of natural gas, oil and NGLs, with our ongoing operations focused on the development of unconventional natural gas reservoirs located in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. Our operations in northeast Pennsylvania, which we refer to as \u201cNortheast Appalachia,\u201d are primarily focused on the unconventional natural gas reservoir known as the Marcellus Shale. Our operations in West Virginia, Ohio and southwest Pennsylvania, which we refer to as \u201cSouthwest Appalachia,\u201d are focused on the Marcellus Shale, the Utica and the Upper Devonian unconventional natural gas and oil reservoirs. Collectively, our properties in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia are herein referred to as \u201cAppalachia.\u201d We also have drilling rigs located in Appalachia, and we provide certain oilfield products and services, principally serving our E&P operations though vertical integration.\nOn November 13, 2020, we closed on our Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger agreement\u201d) with Montage Resources Corporation (\u201cMontage\u201d) pursuant to which Montage merged with and into Southwestern, with Southwestern continuing as the surviving company (the \u201cMerger\u201d). The Merger expanded our footprint in Appalachia by supplementing our Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia operations and by expanding our operations into Ohio. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report for more information on the Merger.\nMarketing. Our marketing activities capture opportunities that arise through the marketing and transportation of natural gas, oil, and NGLs primarily produced in our E&P operations.\nFocus in 2020. We entered 2020 with a continued focus on optimizing our cost structure, maximizing margins in each of our core areas of business while further developing our knowledge of our asset base and looking for strategic transactions that take advantage of our core strengths. The recent Merger and the associated expected cost and operational synergies is a reflection of this strategy. While COVID-19 brought challenges of lower demand for certain of our products resulting in lower oil and NGL pricing (discussed below), we exercised our capital and operational agility by quickly shifting our investments to our higher return natural gas assets. We remained committed to our focus on creating sustainable value with the goal of generating cash flow above and beyond our operational needs, while at the same time maintaining our leading position as stewards of the environment. We continued to protect our financial strength through bond repurchases at a discount as well as a robust derivative program designed to ensure certain cash flow levels by reducing our exposure to commodity price volatility.\nLower natural gas, oil and NGL prices present challenges to our industry and our Company, as do changes in laws, regulations and investor sentiment and other key factors described under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this Annual Report. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental and societal measures (discussed below), along with the disagreements between OPEC and Russia on production levels, caused oil prices to decrease significantly in the first and second quarters of 2020. While oil pricing partially recovered late in the second quarter and continued to improve toward the end of the year, gains on our settled derivatives offset a large portion of the impact of the overall decline in prices. Although we currently expect to maintain a robust rolling three-year derivative portfolio, there can be no\nassurance that we will be able to add derivative positions to cover our expected production at favorable prices. See \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d in",
    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices, basis differentials and interest rates, as well as service costs and credit risk concentrations. We use fixed price swap agreements, options, swaptions, basis swaps and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas, oil and certain NGLs along with interest rates. Our Board of Directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price risk. Utilization of financial products for the reduction of interest rate risks is also overseen by our Board of Directors. These policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings.\nCredit Risk\nOur exposure to concentrations of credit risk consists primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of our purchasers and their dispersion across geographic areas. For the year ended December 31, 2020, one purchaser accounted for 10% of our revenues. A default on this account could have a material impact on the Company, but we do not believe that there is a material risk of a default. No single purchaser accounted for greater than 10% of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019. We believe that the loss of any one customer would not have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our natural gas, oil and NGL production. See \u201cCommodities Risk\u201d below for discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $2.5 billion of outstanding senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 7.02%, and $700 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We currently have an interest rate swap in effect to mitigate a portion of our exposure to volatility in interest rates. At December 31, 2020, we had a long-term issuer credit rating of Ba2 by Moody\u2019s, a long-term debt rating of BB- by S&P and a long-term debt issuer default rating of BB by Fitch Ratings. In April 2020, S&P downgraded our bond rating to BB-, which had the effect of increasing the interest rate on our 2025 Notes to 6.45% following the July 23, 2020 interest payment date. The first coupon payment to the bondholders at the higher interest rate will be paid in January 2021. Any further upgrades or downgrades in our public debt ratings by Moody\u2019s or S&P could decrease or increase our cost of funds, respectively.\n(1)Excludes unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts.\nCommodities Risk\nWe use over-the-counter fixed price swap agreements and options to protect sales of our production against the inherent risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the NYMEX futures market. These swaps and options include transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price (or variable price) for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price (or fixed price) based on a published index (referred to as price swaps) and transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices (referred to as basis swaps).\nThe primary market risks relating to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for our production. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the production that is financially protected. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non-performance by our counterparties. The counterparties are primarily major banks and integrated energy companies that management believes present minimal credit risks. The credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are closely monitored to limit our credit risk exposure. Additionally, we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable. We have not incurred any counterparty losses related to non-performance and do not anticipate any losses given the information we have currently. However, we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future. The fair value of our derivative assets and liabilities includes a non-performance risk factor. We refer you to Note 6 and Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional details about our derivative instruments and their fair value.",

Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, utilizing the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\u2019s Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013).\nBased on this evaluation, management has concluded the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\nManagement\u2019s assessment and conclusion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 excludes an assessment of the internal control over financial reporting of Montage Resources, which was acquired in a business combination on November 13, 2020. Montage represents approximately 22% of our consolidated total assets at December 31, 2020 and 3% of our consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears herein.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Southwestern Energy Company\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southwestern Energy Company and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Montage Resources, Inc. (\u201cMontage\u201d) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2020. We have also excluded Montage from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Montage is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management\u2019s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 22% and 3%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nThe Impact of Proved Natural Gas, Oil and NGL Reserves on Natural Gas and Oil Properties, Net\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s consolidated natural gas and oil properties balance was $27,261 million as of December 31, 2020, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $357 million. The Company utilizes the full cost method of accounting for its natural gas and oil properties. Under this method, all capitalized costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the properties using the unit-of-production method based on proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. These capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such pooled costs, net of applicable deferred taxes, to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves discounted at 10%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, pre-tax impairment charges of $2,825 million were recognized. As disclosed by management, proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are a major component of the full cost ceiling test. Estimates of reserves require extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and projections of costs that will be incurred in developing and producing reserves. The uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of future production volumes and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves. The estimates of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves have been developed by specialists, specifically reservoir engineers, and audited by independent petroleum engineers (together referred to as \u201cmanagement\u2019s specialists\u201d).\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves on natural gas and oil properties, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of management\u2019s specialists, when developing the estimates of proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the data, methods, and assumptions used by management\u2019s specialists in developing the estimates of proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and the assumption applied to the full cost ceiling test calculations related to future production volumes.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s estimates of proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and the calculations of the full cost ceiling impairment test.\nThese procedures also included, among others, testing the full cost ceiling impairment test calculation. The work of management\u2019s specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimates of proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and the reasonableness of future production volumes applied in the full cost ceiling test. As a basis for using this work, management\u2019s specialists\u2019 qualifications were understood and the Company\u2019s relationship with the specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by management\u2019s specialists, tests of the data used by management\u2019s specialists, and an evaluation of management\u2019s specialists\u2019 findings.\nAcquisition of Montage Resources - Valuation of Proved Natural Gas and Oil Properties\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, $1,102 million of the purchase price from the November 2020 business combination of Montage Resources, Inc. was allocated to natural gas and oil properties, net, including $1,012 million related to proved properties. As disclosed by management, the Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the Company recognizes amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed equal to their estimated acquisition date fair values. Fair value of proved natural gas and oil properties as of the acquisition date was based on estimated proved natural gas, oil, and NGL reserves and related discounted net cash flows. Significant inputs to the valuation include estimates of future production volumes, future operating and development costs, future commodity prices and a weighted average cost of capital rate. Estimates of reserves require extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and projections of costs will be incurred in developing and producing reserves. The uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of future production volumes and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves. The estimates of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves have been developed by specialists, specifically reservoir engineers, and audited by independent petroleum engineers (together referred to as \u201cmanagement\u2019s specialists\u201d).\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the acquisition of Montage Resources - valuation of proved natural gas and oil properties is a critical audit matter are the (i) significant judgment by management, including the use of management\u2019s specialists, when developing the fair value measurement of proved natural gas and oil properties; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\u2019s significant assumptions related to future production volumes and commodity prices, as well as the weighted average cost of capital; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of the acquired proved natural gas and oil properties. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management\u2019s process for developing the fair value measurement of proved natural gas and oil properties; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the model; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management related to future production volumes and commodity prices, as well as the weighted average cost of capital. Evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s assumption related to future commodity prices involved comparing the prices against observable market data and evaluating differentials through inspection of the underlying contracts. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of reasonableness of the weighted average cost of capital assumption and the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model. The work of management\u2019s specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserve volumes as stated in the Critical Audit Matter titled \u201cThe Impact of Proved Natural Gas, Oil and NGL Reserves on Natural Gas and Oil Properties, Net\u201d and the reasonableness of the future production volumes. As a basis for using this work, the specialists\u2019 qualifications were understood and the Company\u2019s relationship with the specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of the data used by the specialists and an evaluation of the specialists\u2019 findings.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nHouston, Texas\nMarch 1, 2021\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2002.\nSOUTHWESTERN ENERGY COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nSOUTHWESTERN ENERGY COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\n(1)In 2018, deferred tax activity incurred in other comprehensive income was offset by a valuation allowance.\n(2)Net of $1 million and $2 million in taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(3)Net of ($2) million and ($1) million in taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nSOUTHWESTERN ENERGY COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nSOUTHWESTERN ENERGY COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nSOUTHWESTERN ENERGY COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nSOUTHWESTERN ENERGY COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(1) ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Operations\nSouthwestern Energy Company (including its subsidiaries, collectively \u201cSouthwestern\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is an independent energy company engaged in natural gas, oil and NGLs exploration, development and production (\u201cE&P\u201d). The Company is also focused on creating and capturing additional value through its marketing business (\u201cMarketing\u201d), which was previously referred to as \u201cMidstream\u201d when it included the operations of gathering systems. Southwestern conducts most of its business through subsidiaries and operates principally in two segments: E&P and Marketing.\nE&P. Southwestern\u2019s primary business is the exploration for and production of natural gas, oil and NGLs, with ongoing operations focused on the development of unconventional natural gas and oil reservoirs located in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. The Company\u2019s operations in northeast Pennsylvania, herein referred to as \u201cNortheast Appalachia,\u201d are primarily focused on the unconventional natural gas reservoir known as the Marcellus Shale. Operations in West Virginia, Ohio and southwest Pennsylvania, herein referred to as \u201cSouthwest Appalachia,\u201d are focused on the Marcellus Shale, the Utica and the Upper Devonian unconventional natural gas and oil reservoirs. Collectively, Southwestern refers to its properties located in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia as \u201cAppalachia.\u201d The Company also operates drilling rigs located in Appalachia, and provides oilfield products and services, principally serving the Company's E&P operations through vertical integration.\nIn August 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with Montage Resources Corporation (\"Montage\") pursuant to which Montage will merge with and into Southwestern, with Southwestern continuing as the surviving company (the \"Merger\"). The Company acquired at the effective time of the merger all of the outstanding shares of common stock in Montage in exchange for 1.8656 shares of Southwestern common stock per share of Montage common stock. The transaction closed on November 13, 2020. The Merger expanded the Company's footprint in Appalachia by supplementing the Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia operations and by expanding the Company's operations into Ohio. See Note 3 for more information about the Merger.\nMarketing. Southwestern\u2019s marketing activities capture opportunities that arise through the marketing and transportation of natural gas, oil and NGLs primarily produced in its E&P operations.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report present the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the date of the financial statements, and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company evaluates subsequent events through the date the financial statements are issued.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Southwestern and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nIn 2015, the Company purchased an 86% ownership in a limited partnership that owns and operates a gathering system in Northeast Appalachia. Because the Company owns a controlling interest in the partnership, the operating and financial results are consolidated with the Company\u2019s E&P segment results. The minority partner\u2019s share of the partnership activity is reported in retained earnings in the consolidated financial statements. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was insignificant.\nMajor Customers\nThe Company sells the vast majority of its E&P natural gas, oil and NGL production to third-party customers through its marketing subsidiary. Customers include major energy companies, utilities and industrial purchasers of Natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2020, one purchaser accounted for 10% of total revenues. A default on this account could have a material impact on the Company, but the Company does not believe that there is a material risk of default. No other purchasers accounted for greater than 10% of consolidated revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2019, no single customer accounted for 10% or greater of total sales. The Company believes that the loss of any one customer would not have an adverse effect on its ability to sell its natural gas, oil and NGL production.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are defined by the Company as short-term, highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less and deposits in money market mutual funds that are readily convertible into cash. Management considers cash and cash equivalents to have minimal credit and market risk as the Company monitors the credit status of the financial institutions holding its cash and marketable securities. The following table presents a summary of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019:\n(1)Consists of government stable value money market funds. Immaterial as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s cash accounts are zero-balance controlled disbursement accounts. The Company presents the outstanding checks written against these zero-balance accounts as a component of accounts payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Outstanding checks included as a component of accounts payable totaled $16 million and $15 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nProperty, Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nNatural Gas and Oil Properties. The Company utilizes the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive), including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities, are capitalized on a country-by-country basis and amortized over the estimated lives of the properties using the units-of-production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs, net of applicable deferred taxes, to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves discounted at 10% (standardized measure). Any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non-cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas, oil and NGL prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Companies using the full cost method are required to use the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months, including the impact of derivatives designated for hedge accounting, to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves. Decreases in market prices as well as changes in production rates, levels of reserves, evaluation of costs excluded from amortization, future development costs and production costs could result in future ceiling test impairments.\nCosts associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the amortization base until the properties are evaluated or impairment is indicated. The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and related seismic data, wells currently drilling and related capitalized interest are initially excluded from the amortization base. Leasehold costs are either transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed at least annually for possible impairment or reduction in value. The Company\u2019s decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involves judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and drilling results from adjacent acreage. At December 31, 2020, the Company had a total of $1,472 million of costs excluded from the amortization base, all of which related to its properties in the United States. Inclusion of some or all of these costs in the Company\u2019s United States properties in the future, without adding any associated reserves, could result in additional non-cash ceiling test impairments.\nIn the first, second and third quarters of 2020, the net book value of the Company's United States natural gas and oil properties exceeded the ceiling by approximately $1,479 million, $650 million and $361 million, respectively, and resulted in non-cash ceiling test impairments. At December 31, 2020, using the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months for Henry Hub natural gas of $1.98 per MMBtu, West Texas Intermediate oil of $39.57 per barrel and NGLs of $10.27 per barrel, adjusted for market differentials, the Company\u2019s net book value of its United States natural gas and oil properties exceeded the ceiling by approximately $335 million and resulted in an additional non-cash ceiling test impairment. The Company had no derivative positions that were designated for hedge accounting as of December 31, 2020.\nNo impairment expense was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 in relation to the Company\u2019s recently acquired Montage natural gas and oil properties. These properties were recorded at fair value as of November 13, 2020, in accordance with ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement. Pursuant to SEC guidance, the Company determined that the fair value of the properties acquired at the closing of the Merger clearly exceeded the related full-cost ceiling limitation beyond a reasonable doubt and received a waiver from the SEC to exclude the properties acquired in the Merger from the ceiling test calculation. This waiver was granted for all reporting periods through and including the quarter ending September 30, 2021 as long as the Company can\ncontinue to demonstrate that the fair value of properties acquired clearly exceeds the full cost ceiling limitation beyond a reasonable doubt in each reporting period. As part of the waiver received from the SEC, the Company is required to disclose what the full cost ceiling test impairment amounts for all periods presented in each applicable quarterly and annual filing would have been if the waiver had not been granted. The fair value of the properties acquired in the Merger was based on forward strip natural gas and oil pricing existing at the date of the Merger, and management affirmed that there has not been a material decline to the fair value of these acquired assets since the Merger. The properties acquired in the Merger have an unamortized cost at December 31, 2020 of $1,087 million. Had management not received the waiver from the SEC, the impairment charge recorded would have been an additional $539 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nUsing the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months for Henry Hub natural gas of $2.58 per MMBtu, West Texas Intermediate oil of $55.69 per barrel and NGLs of $11.58 per barrel, adjusted for market differentials, the Company\u2019s net book value of its United States natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling amount and did not result in a ceiling test impairment at December 31, 2019. The Company had no derivative positions that were designated for hedge accounting as of December 31, 2019.\nUsing the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months for Henry Hub natural gas of $3.10 per MMBtu, West Texas Intermediate oil of $65.56 per barrel and NGLs of $17.64 per barrel, adjusted for market differentials, the Company\u2019s net book value of its United States natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling amount and did not results in a ceiling test impairment at December 31, 2018. The Company had no derivative positions that were designated for hedge accounting as of December 31, 2018.\nCapitalized Interest. Interest is capitalized on the cost of unevaluated natural gas and oil properties that are excluded from amortization.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. Natural gas and oil properties require expenditures to plug and abandon the wells and reclaim the associated pads and other supporting infrastructure when the wells are no longer producing. An asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset such as oil and gas properties is recognized as a liability in the period incurred or when it becomes determinable, with an associated increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The cost of the tangible asset, including the asset retirement cost, is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. The asset retirement obligation is recorded at its estimated fair value, and accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.\nOther Property and Equipment. The Company\u2019s non-full cost pool assets include water facilities, gathering systems, technology infrastructure, land, buildings and other equipment with useful lives that range from 3 to 30 years.\nThe estimated useful lives of those assets depreciated under the straight-line method are as follows:\nOther property, plant and equipment is comprised of the following:\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. The carrying value of non-full cost pool long-lived assets is evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may not be recoverable. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured as the amount that the asset\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 the Company recognized non-cash impairments of $5 million and $16 million, respectively, for non-core assets. During 2018, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $160 million related to gathering and other E&P assets sold in the Fayetteville Shale sale and $11 million related to other non-core assets.\nIntangible Assets. The carrying value of intangible assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may not be recoverable. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful life. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $48 million and $56 million, respectively, in marketing-related intangible assets that were included in Other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company amortized $9 million of its marketing-related intangible asset in each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, and expects to amortize $8 million in 2021 and $5 million per year for the four years thereafter.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if a contract contains a lease at inception or as a result of an acquisition. A lease is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment (an identified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. A right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability are recognized on the balance sheet at commencement at an amount based on the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the implicit rate of the lease is not always readily determinable, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of the lease payments based on information available at commencement date, such as the initial lease term. Operating right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are presented separately on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company does not have any finance leases as of December 31, 2020. By policy election, leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis, and variable lease payments are recognized in the period as incurred.\nCertain leases contain both lease and non-lease components. The Company has chosen to account for most of these leases as a single lease component instead of bifurcating lease and non-lease components. However, for compression service leases and fleet vehicle leases, the lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately.\nThe Company leases drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment, vehicles, office space, certain water transportation lines and other equipment under non-cancelable operating leases expiring through 2036. Certain lease agreements include options to renew the lease, early terminate the lease or purchase the underlying asset(s). The Company determines the lease term at the lease commencement date as the non-cancelable period of the lease, including options to extend or terminate the lease when such an option is reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company\u2019s water transportation lines are the only leases with renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised. These renewal options are reflected in the right-of-use asset and lease liability balances.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rate expected to be in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year of the enacted rate change. Deferred income taxes are provided to recognize the income tax effect of reporting certain transactions in different years for income tax and financial reporting purposes. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, is recognized when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position. The amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect management\u2019s estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties. The Company recognizes penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions within the provision (benefit) for income taxes line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Additional information regarding uncertain tax positions along with the impact of the Tax Reform Act can be found in Note 11.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage defined commodity price risks and does not use them for speculative trading purposes. The Company uses derivative instruments to financially protect sales of natural gas, oil and NGLs. In addition, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage exposure to unfavorable interest rate changes. Since the Company does not designate its derivatives for hedge accounting treatment, gains and losses resulting from the settlement of derivative contracts have been recognized in gain (loss) on derivatives in the consolidated statements of operations when the contracts expire and the related physical transactions of the underlying commodity are settled. Additionally, changes in the fair value of the unsettled portion of derivative contracts are also recognized in gain (loss) on derivatives in the consolidated statement of operations. See Note 6 and Note 8 for a discussion of the Company\u2019s hedging activities.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reportable period. The diluted earnings per share calculation adds to the weighted average number of common shares outstanding: the incremental shares that would have been outstanding assuming the exercise of dilutive stock options, the vesting of unvested restricted shares of common stock, restricted stock units and performance units. An antidilutive impact is an increase in earnings per share or a reduction in net loss per share resulting from the conversion, exercise, or contingent issuance of certain securities.\nIn August 2020, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 63,250,000 shares of its common stock with an offering price to the public of $2.50 per share. Net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses were approximately $152 million. See Note 3 for additional details regarding the Company's use of proceeds from the equity offering.\nUnder the Agreement and Plan of Merger, Montage shareholders received 1.8656 shares of Southwestern common stock for each share of Montage common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the date of Merger. On November 13, 2020, the Company issued 69,740,848 shares of its common stock, or approximately $213 million in value (based on Southwestern common stock closing price as of November 13, 2020 of $3.05), as Merger consideration.\nIn January 2015, the Company issued 34,500,000 depositary shares that entitled the holder to a proportional fractional interest in the rights and preferences of the mandatory convertible preferred stock, including conversion, dividend, liquidation and voting rights. The mandatory convertible preferred stock had the non-forfeitable right to participate on an as-converted basis at the conversion rate then in effect in any common stock dividends declared and, therefore, was considered a participating security. Accordingly, it has been included in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, pursuant to the two-class method. In the calculation of basic earnings per share attributable to common shareholders, earnings are allocated to participating securities based on actual dividend distributions received plus a proportionate share of undistributed net income attributable to common shareholders, if any, after recognizing distributed earnings. The Company\u2019s participating securities do not participate in undistributed net losses because they are not contractually obligated to do so. In January 2018, all outstanding shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock were converted to 74,998,614 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company paid its last dividend payment of approximately $27 million associated with the depositary shares in January 2018.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s share repurchase program, the Company paid approximately $180 million to repurchase 39,061,268 shares of its outstanding common stock in 2018 and paid approximately $21 million to repurchase 5,260,687 shares in 2019, which are included in the Company's treasury stock.\nThe following table presents the computation of earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nThe following table presents the common stock shares equivalent excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, as they would have had an antidilutive effect:\nSupplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information\nThe following table provides additional information concerning interest and income taxes paid as well as changes in noncash investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n(1)Includes $1,097 million in noncash additions related to the Montage Merger.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation transactions using a fair value method and recognizes an amount equal to the fair value of the stock options and stock-based payment cost in either the consolidated statement of operations and capitalizes the cost into natural gas and oil properties included in property and equipment. Costs are capitalized when they are directly related to the acquisition, exploration and development activities of the Company\u2019s natural gas and oil properties. See Note 14 for a discussion of the Company\u2019s stock-based compensation.\nLiability-Classified Awards\nThe Company classifies certain awards that can or will be settled in cash as liability awards. The fair value of a liability-classified award is determined on a quarterly basis beginning at the grant date until final vesting. Changes in the fair value of liability-classified awards are recorded to general and administrative expense, operating expense and capitalized expense over the vesting period of the award. The Company\u2019s liability-classified performance unit awards that were granted in 2018 include a performance condition based on cash flow per debt-adjusted share and two market conditions, one based on absolute total\nshareholder return (\u201cTSR\u201d) and the other on relative TSR as compared to a group of the Company\u2019s peers. The Company\u2019s liability-classified performance unit awards that were granted in 2019 include a performance condition based on the return of average capital employed and the same two market conditions as in the 2018 awards. The liability-based performance unit awards granted in 2020 include a performance condition based on return on average capital employed and a market condition based on relative TSR. The fair values of the market conditions discussed above are calculated by Monte Carlo models on a quarterly basis. See Note 14 for a discussion of the Company\u2019s stock-based compensation.\nCash-Based Compensation\nThe Company classifies certain awards that will be settled in cash as cash-based compensation. The Company recognizes the cost of these awards as general and administrative expense, operating expense and capitalized expense over the vesting period of the awards. The performance cash awards include a performance condition determined annually by the Company. If the Company, in its sole discretion, determines that the threshold was not met, the amount for that vesting period will not vest and will be canceled.\nTreasury Stock\nIn 2018, the Company repurchased 39,061,268 shares of its outstanding common stock per a previously announced share repurchase program at an average price of $4.63 per share for approximately $180 million. In 2019, the Company completed its share repurchase program by purchasing another 5,260,687 shares of its outstanding common stock for approximately $21 million at an average price of $3.84 per share.\nThe Company maintains a frozen legacy non-qualified deferred compensation supplemental retirement savings plan for certain key employees whereby participants could elect to defer and contribute a portion of their compensation to a Rabbi Trust, as permitted by the plan. The Company includes the assets and liabilities of its supplemental retirement savings plan in its consolidated balance sheet. Shares of the Company\u2019s common stock purchased under the non-qualified deferred compensation arrangement are held in the Rabbi Trust, are presented as treasury stock and are carried at cost. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, 3,632 shares and 5,115 shares, respectively, were held in the Rabbi Trust and were accounted for as treasury stock.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company has designated the Canadian dollar as the functional currency for its activities in Canada. The cumulative translation effects of translating the accounts from the functional currency into the U.S. dollar at current exchange rates are included as a separate component of other comprehensive income within stockholders\u2019 equity.\nNew Accounting Standards Implemented in this Report\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-13, Fair Value Management (ASC 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements (\"ASU 2018-13\"), which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 became effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. As a result of this adoption, this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\u201cUpdate 2016-13\u201d). Update 2016-13 replaced the incurred loss model with an expected loss model, which is referred to as the current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model. The CECL model is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, including but not limited to trade receivables. For public business entities, the new standard became effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period.\nFrom an evaluation of the Company\u2019s existing and recently acquired credit portfolios, which include trade receivables from commodity sales, joint interest billings due from partners and other receivables and cash equivalents, historical credit losses have been de minimis and are expected to remain so in the future assuming no substantial changes to the business or creditworthiness of our business counterparties. Update 2016-13 did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or related control environment upon adoption on January 1, 2020.\nNew Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted in this Report\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans (\"ASU 2018-14\"). This ASU amends, adds and removes certain disclosure requirements under FASB ASC Topic 715 - Compensation - Retirement Benefits. The guidance in ASU 2018-14 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. This ASU will result in expanded disclosures within the Company's interim\nand annual footnote disclosures, however, the adoption of ASU 2018 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform, as a new Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic, ASC 848. The purpose of ASC 848 is to provide optional guidance to ease the potential effects on financial reporting of the market-wide migration away from Interbank Offered Rates, such as LIBOR, which is expected to be phased out at the end of calendar year 2021, to alternative reference rates. ASC 848 applies only to contracts, hedging relationships, debt arrangements and other transactions that reference a benchmark reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. ASC 848 contains optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to transactions affected by this reform. The amendments in the ASU are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this new guidance.\n(2) RESTRUCTURING CHARGES\nAs part of an ongoing strategic effort to reposition its portfolio, optimize operational performance and improve margins, the Company has incurred charges related to restructuring that include reductions in workforce, office consolidation and other costs, including those associated with the sale of a large asset such as the Fayetteville Shale. These charges are further discussed below. The following table presents a summary of the restructuring charges included in Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n(1)Does not include a $4 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to curtailment of the other postretirement benefit plan presented in other income (loss), net on the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe following table presents a summary of liabilities associated with the Company\u2019s restructuring activities at December 31, 2020, which are reflected in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet:\nReduction in Workforce (Not Fayetteville Shale Sale-Related)\nIn February 2020, the Company notified employees of a workforce reduction plan as a result of a strategic realignment of the Company's organizational structure. This reduction was substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of 2020. Affected employees were offered a severance package, which included a one-time payment depending on length of service and, if applicable, the current value of unvested long-term incentive awards that were forfeited. These costs were recognized as restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company also recognized additional severance costs in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to continued organizational restructuring for which a liability of $3 million has been accrued as of December 31, 2020.\nIn June 2018, the Company notified affected employees of a workforce reduction plan, which resulted primarily from a previously announced study of structural, process and organizational changes to enhance shareholder value and continues with respect to other aspects of the Company\u2019s business activities. Affected employees were offered a severance package, which included a one-time cash payment depending on length of service and, if applicable, the current value of a portion of equity awards that were forfeited.\nThe following table presents a summary of the restructuring charges related to workforce reduction plans included in Operating Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n(1)Total restructuring charges were $16 million for the Company's E&P segment for the year ended December 31, 2020. Total restructuring charges for the Company's E&P and Marketing segments were $21 million and $2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFayetteville Shale Sale-Related\nIn December 2018, the Company closed on the sale of the equity in certain of its subsidiaries that owned and operated its Fayetteville Shale E&P and related midstream gathering assets in Arkansas. As part of this transaction, most employees associated with those assets became employees of the buyer although the employment of some was terminated. All affected employees were offered a severance package, which included a one-time cash payment depending on length of service and, if applicable, the current value of a portion of equity awards that were forfeited. The Company had substantially completed the Fayetteville Shale sale-related employment terminations by December 31, 2019.\nAs a result of the Fayetteville Shale sale, the Company relocated certain employees and infrastructure to other locations and began the process of consolidating and reorganizing its office space. Approximately $2 million in charges related to office consolidation and reorganization were recognized as restructuring charges.\nIn July 2019, the Company terminated its existing lease agreement in its headquarters office building and entered into a new 10-year lease agreement for a smaller portion of the building. Approximately $3 million of the fees associated with the Company\u2019s headquarters office consolidation and $1 million in other office consolidation expenses are reflected as restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company also recognized additional severance costs in the third and fourth quarters of 2019, related to continued organizational restructuring. The following table presents a summary of the restructuring charges related to the consolidation and reorganization associated with the Fayetteville Shale sale included in Operating Income on the condensed statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n(1)Total restructuring charges were $11 million and $16 million for the Company\u2019s E&P segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(2)Does not include a $4 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the curtailment of the other postretirement benefit plan presented in Other Income (Loss), net on the consolidated statements of operations.\nSee Note 3 for a discussion of the Company\u2019s Fayetteville Shale sale.\n(3) ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nMontage Resources Merger\nOn August 12, 2020, Southwestern entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Montage Resources Corporation (\u201cMontage\u201d) whereby Montage would merge with and into Southwestern, with Southwestern continuing as the surviving company (the \"Merger\"). On November 12, 2020, Montage\u2019s stockholders voted to approve the Merger and it was made effective on November 13, 2020. The Merger added to Southwestern\u2019s oil and gas portfolio in Appalachia.\nIn exchange for each share of Montage common stock, Montage stockholders received 1.8656 shares of Southwestern common stock, plus cash in lieu of any fractional share of Southwestern common stock that otherwise would have been issued, based on the average price of $3.05 per share of Southwestern common stock on the NYSE on November 13, 2020. Following the closing of the Merger, Southwestern's existing shareholders and Montage's existing shareholders owned approximately 90% and 10%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of the combined company.\nIn anticipation of the Merger, in August 2020 Southwestern issued $350 million of new senior unsecured notes and 63,250,000 shares of common stock for $152 million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The\nCompany used the net proceeds from the debt and common stock offerings and borrowings under its revolving credit facility to fund a redemption of $510 million aggregate principal amount of Montage's outstanding 8.875% senior notes due 2023 (the \"Montage Notes\") and related accrued interest in connection with the closing of the Merger. See Note 1 and Note 9 for additional information.\nThe Merger constitutes a business combination and was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The following table presents the fair value of consideration transferred to Montage stockholders as a result of the Merger:\nThe following table sets forth the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Although the purchase price allocation is substantially complete as of the date of this filing, there may be further adjustments to the Company\u2019s natural gas and oil properties. These amounts will be finalized no later than one year from the acquisition date.\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their preliminary estimated fair values at the date of the Merger. The valuation of certain assets, including property, are based on preliminary appraisals. The fair value of acquired equipment is based on both available market data and a cost approach.\nUnevaluated oil and gas properties were valued primarily using a market approach based on comparable transactions for similar properties while the income approach was utilized for proved oil and gas properties based on underlying reserve projections at the Merger date. Income approaches are considered Level 3 fair value estimates and include significant assumptions of future production, commodity prices, and operating and capital cost estimates, discounted using weighted average cost of capital for industry peers, and risk adjustment factors based on reserve category. Price assumptions were based on\nobservable market pricing adjusted for historical differentials. Cost estimates were based on current observable costs inflated based on historical and expected future inflation. Taxes were based on current statutory rates.\nDeferred income taxes represent the tax effects of differences in the tax basis and merger-date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. A full valuation was placed on all deferred tax assets assumed from Montage consistent with the Company\u2019s treatment of its deferred tax asset balance as of December 31, 2020. The measurement of senior unsecured notes was based on unadjusted quoted prices in an active market and are primarily Level 1. The Company considered the borrowings under the revolving credit facility to approximate fair value. The value of derivative instruments was based on observable inputs, primarily forward commodity-price and interest-rate curves and is considered Level 2.\nWith the completion of the Merger, Southwestern acquired proved and unproved properties of approximately $1.0 billion and $90 million, respectively, primarily associated with the Appalachian Basin. The remaining $28 million in Other property, plant and equipment consists of a gathering system, buildings and various equipment.\nFrom the date of the Merger through December 31, 2020, revenues and the net income attributable to common stockholders associated with the operations acquired through the Merger totaled $63 million and $28 million, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the unaudited pro forma condensed financial information of Southwestern as if the Merger had occurred on January 1, 2019:\nThe unaudited pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred had the Merger been completed at January 1, 2019, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results of the combined entity. The unaudited pro forma information gives effect to the Merger and related equity and debt issuances along with the use of proceeds therefrom as if they had occurred on January 1, 2019. The unaudited pro forma information for 2020 and 2019 is a result of combining the statements of operations of Southwestern with the pre-Merger results from January 1, 2020, and 2019 of Montage and included adjustments for revenues and direct expenses. The pro forma results exclude any cost savings anticipated as a result of the Merger and the impact of any Merger-related costs. The pro forma results include adjustments to DD&A (depreciation, depletion and amortization) based on the purchase price allocated to property, plant, and equipment and the estimated useful lives as well as adjustments to interest expense. Interest expense was adjusted to reflect the retirement of the Montage senior notes, the Montage credit facility, all related accrued interest and the associated decrease in amortization of issuance costs related to the Montage notes and revolving line of credit. This decrease was partially offset by increases in interest on debt associated with the issuance of $350 million in new 8.375% Senior Notes due 2028 related to the Southwestern debt offering and borrowings under Southwestern\u2019s credit facility used to pay off the Montage notes, Montage credit facility and related accrued interest. Management believes the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, and the relative effects of the Merger are properly reflected.\nMontage Merger-Related Expenses\nThe following table summarizes the Merger-related expenses incurred for the year ended December 31, 2020:\nEmployee severance and related employee cost primarily relates to one-time severance costs and the accelerated vesting of certain Montage share-based awards for former Montage employees based on the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and existing change of control provisions within the former Montage employment agreements. Contract buyouts primarily consist of the costs associated with the settlement of contracts inherited from Montage that had no future value to the Company\u2019s ongoing business.\n2019 Divestitures\nDuring 2019, the Company sold non-core acreage for $38 million. There was no production or proved reserves associated with this acreage. In addition, during July 2019, the Company sold the land associated with its headquarters office building for $16 million and recognized a $2 million gain on the sale. The Company also from time to time sells leases and other properties whose value, individually, is not material but is reflected in the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nFayetteville Shale Sale\nIn December 2018, the Company closed the Fayetteville Shale sale and received approximately $1,650 million, which included purchase price adjustments of approximately $215 million primarily related to the net cash flows from the economic effective date to the closing date. The Company allocated the sale proceeds to gain on sale for the non-full cost pool assets and to capitalized costs for the full cost pool assets based on the proportion of the estimated fair values of the underlying assets. The fair values of these assets was estimated primarily using an income approach. Consequently, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of non-full cost pool assets of $17 million and a reduction of $887 million to its full cost pool assets. As the sale did not involve a significant change in proved reserves or significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, the Company recognized no gain or loss related to the full cost pool assets sold.\nIn accordance with accounting guidance for Property, Plant and Equipment, assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Because the assets outside the full cost pool included in the Fayetteville Shale sale met the criteria for held for sale accounting as of September 30, 2018, the Company determined the carrying value of certain non-full cost pool assets exceeded the fair value less costs to sell. As a result, a non-cash impairment charge of $161 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2018, of which $145 million related to midstream gathering assets held for sale and $15 million related to E&P assets held for sale. Additionally, the Company recorded a $1 million non-cash impairment related to other non-core assets that were not included in the sale.\n(4) LEASES\nAs part of the Montage Merger, the Company acquired $25 million of operating right of use assets and corresponding lease liabilities which were recognized as part of the Company\u2019s acquisition accounting in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIn July 2019, the Company terminated its existing lease agreement and entered into a new ten-year lease agreement for a smaller portion of the headquarters office building, which resulted in the Company making a $6 million residual value guarantee short-fall payment to the building\u2019s previous lessor. The Company\u2019s variable lease costs are primarily comprised of variable operating charges incurred in connection with the new building lease which are expected to continue throughout the lease term. There are currently no material residual value guarantees in the Company\u2019s existing leases.\nThe components of lease costs are shown below:\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had operating leases of $6 million, related primarily to compressor leases, that have been executed but not yet commenced. These operating leases are planned to commence during 2021 with lease terms expiring through 2024. The Company\u2019s existing operating leases do not contain any material restrictive covenants.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases is set forth below:\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases is as follows:\nMaturity analysis of operating lease liabilities:\n(5) REVENUE RECOGNITION\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Under the modified retrospective method, the Company recognizes the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings; however, no material adjustment was required as a result of adopting ASC 606. Results for reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2018 are presented under the new revenue standard. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The Company performed an analysis of the impact of adopting ASC 606 across all revenue streams and did not identify any changes to its revenue recognition policies that resulted in a material impact to its consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\nNatural gas and liquids. Natural gas, oil and NGL sales are recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer at a designated delivery point. The pricing provisions of the Company\u2019s contracts are primarily tied to a market index with certain adjustments based on factors such as delivery, quality of the product and prevailing supply and demand conditions in the geographic areas in which the Company operates. Under the Company\u2019s sales contracts, the delivery of each unit of natural gas, oil and NGLs represents a separate performance obligation, and revenue is recognized at the point in time when the performance obligations are fulfilled. There is no significant financing component to the Company\u2019s revenues as payment terms are typically within 30 to 60 days of control transfer. Furthermore, consideration from a customer corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company\u2019s performance completed to date. As a result, the Company recognizes revenue in the amount to which the Company has a right to invoice and has not disclosed information regarding its remaining performance obligations.\nThe Company records revenue from its natural gas and liquids production in the amount of its net revenue interest in sales from its properties. Accordingly, natural gas and liquid sales are not recognized for deliveries in excess of the Company\u2019s net revenue interest, while natural gas and liquid sales are recognized for any under-delivered volumes.\nMarketing. The Company, through its marketing affiliate, generally markets natural gas, oil and NGLs for its affiliated E&P companies as well as other joint owners who choose to market with the Company. In addition, the Company markets some\nproducts purchased from third parties. Marketing revenues for natural gas, oil and NGL sales are recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer at a designated delivery point. The pricing provisions of the Company\u2019s contracts are primarily tied to market indices with certain adjustments based on factors such as delivery, quality of the product and prevailing supply and demand conditions. Under the Company\u2019s marketing contracts, the delivery of each unit of natural gas, oil and NGLs represents a separate performance obligation, and revenue is recognized at the point in time when the performance obligations are fulfilled. Customers are invoiced and revenues are recorded each month as natural gas, oil and NGLs are delivered, and payment terms are typically within 30 to 60 days of control transfer. Furthermore, consideration from a customer corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company\u2019s performance completed to date. As a result, the Company recognizes revenue in the amount to which the Company has a right to invoice and has not disclosed information regarding its remaining performance obligations.\nGas gathering. Prior to the Fayetteville Shale sale in December 2018, the Company, through its midstream gathering affiliate, gathered natural gas pursuant to a variety of contracts with customers, including an affiliated E&P company. The performance obligations for gas gathering services included delivery of each unit of natural gas to the designated delivery point, which may include treating of certain natural gas units to meet interstate pipeline specifications. Revenue was recognized at the point in time when performance obligations were fulfilled. Under the Company\u2019s gathering contracts, customers were invoiced and revenue was recognized each month based on the volume of natural gas transported and treated at a contractually agreed upon price per unit. Payment terms were typically within 30 to 60 days of completion of the performance obligations. Furthermore, consideration from a customer corresponded directly with the value to the customer of the Company\u2019s performance completed to date. As a result, the Company recognized revenue in the amount to which the Company had a right to invoice and had not disclosed information regarding its remaining performance obligations. Any imbalances were settled on a monthly basis by cashing-out with the respective shipper. Accordingly, there were no contract assets or contract liabilities related to the Company\u2019s gas gathering revenues.\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nThe Company presents a disaggregation of E&P revenues by product in the consolidated statements of operations net of intersegment revenues. The following table reconciles operating revenues as presented on the consolidated statements of operations to the operating revenues by segment:\n(1)Other E&P revenues consists primarily of water sales to third-party operators and other marketing revenues consists primarily of sales of gas from storage.\n(2)The Company\u2019s gas gathering assets were divested in December 2018 as part of the Fayetteville Shale sale.\nAssociated E&P revenues are also disaggregated for analysis on a geographic basis by the core areas in which the Company operates, which are primarily in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In December 2018, the Company sold 100% of its Fayetteville Shale assets.\nReceivables from Contracts with Customers\nThe following table reconciles the Company\u2019s receivables from contracts with customers to consolidated accounts receivable as presented on the consolidated balance sheet:\nAmounts recognized against the Company\u2019s allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables arising from contracts with customers were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company has no contract assets or contract liabilities associated with its revenues from contracts with customers.\n(6) DERIVATIVES AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe Company is exposed to volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas, oil and NGLs, which impacts the predictability of its cash flows related to the sale of those commodities. These risks are managed by the Company\u2019s use of certain derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s derivative financial instruments consisted of fixed price swaps, two-way costless collars, three-way costless collars, basis swaps, call options and interest rate swaps. A description of the Company\u2019s derivative financial instruments is provided below:\nFixed price swaps If the Company sells a fixed price swap, the Company receives a fixed price for the contract and pays a floating market to the counterparty. If the Company purchases a fixed price swap, the Company receives a floating market price for the contract and pays a fixed price to the counterparty.\nTwo-way costless collars Arrangements that contain a fixed floor price (purchased put option) and a fixed ceiling price (sold call option) based on an index price which, in aggregate, have no net cost. At the contract settlement date, (1) if the index price is higher than the ceiling price, the Company pays the counterparty the difference between the index price and ceiling price, (2) if the index price is between the floor and ceiling prices, no payments are due from either party, and (3) if the index price is below the floor price, the Company will receive the difference between the floor price and the index price.\nThree-way costless collars Arrangements that contain a purchased put option, a sold call option and a sold put option based on an index price which, in aggregate, have no net cost. At the contract settlement date, (1) if the index price is higher than the sold call strike price, the Company pays the counterparty the difference between the index price and sold call strike price, (2) if the index price is between the purchased put strike price and the sold call strike price, no payments are due from either party, (3) if the index price is between the sold put strike price and the purchased put strike price, the Company will receive the difference between the purchased put strike price and the index price, and (4) if the index price is below the sold put strike price, the Company will receive the difference between the purchased put strike price and the sold put strike price.\nBasis swaps Arrangements that guarantee a price differential for natural gas from a specified delivery point. If the Company sells a basis swap, the Company receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract. If the Company purchases a basis swap, the Company pays the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the state terms of the contract and receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract.\nCall options The Company purchases and sells call options in exchange for a premium. If the Company purchases a call option, the Company receives from the counterparty the excess (if any) of the market price over the strike price of the call option at the time of settlement, but if the market price is below the call\u2019s strike price, no payment is due from either party. If the Company sells a call option, the Company pays the counterparty the excess (if any) of the market price over the strike price at the time of settlement, but if the market price is below the call\u2019s strike price, no payment is due from either party.\nSwaptions Instruments that refer to an option to enter into a fixed price swap. In exchange for an option premium, the purchaser gains the right but not the obligation to enter a specified swap agreement with the issuer for specified future dates. If the Company sells a swaption, the counterparty has the right to enter into a fixed price swap wherein the Company receives a fixed price for the contract and pays a floating market price to the counterparty. If the Company purchases a swaption, the Company has the right to enter into a fixed price swap wherein the Company receives a floating market price for the contract and pays a fixed price to the counterparty.\nInterest rate swaps Interest rate swaps are used to fix or float interest rates on existing or anticipated indebtedness. The purpose of these instruments is to manage the Company\u2019s existing or anticipated exposure to unfavorable interest rate changes.\nThe Company chooses counterparties for its derivative instruments that it believes are creditworthy at the time the transactions are entered into, and the Company actively monitors the credit ratings and credit default swap rates of these counterparties where applicable. However, there can be no assurance that a counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to the Company. The Company presents its derivative positions on a gross basis and does not net the asset and liability positions.\nThe following tables provide information about the Company\u2019s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in commodity prices and that are used to protect the Company\u2019s exposure. None of the financial instruments below are designated\nfor hedge accounting treatment. The tables present the notional amount, the weighted average contract prices and the fair value by expected maturity dates as of December 31, 2020:\nFinancial Protection on Production\n(1)The Company has entered into certain derivatives to protect the value of volumes of natural gas injected into a storage facility that will be withdrawn at a later date.\n(1)The Company has entered into a limited number of derivatives to protect the value of certain long-term sales contracts.\nAt December 31, 2020, the net fair value of the Company\u2019s financial instruments related to commodities was a $41 million liability and included a net reduction of the liability of $1 million due to non-performance risk. See Note 8 for additional details regarding the Company's fair value measurements of its derivative positions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had no positions designated for hedge accounting treatment. Gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment, or do not meet hedge accounting requirements, are recorded as a component of gain (loss) on derivatives on the consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, the gain (loss) on derivatives component of the statement of operations reflects the gains and losses on both settled and unsettled derivatives. Only the settled gains and losses are included in the Company\u2019s realized commodity price calculations.\nThe balance sheet classification of the assets and liabilities related to derivative financial instruments are summarized below as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n(1)Includes $9 million in premiums paid related to certain natural gas fixed price swaps recognized as a component of derivative assets within current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019. As certain natural gas fixed price swaps settle, the premium will be amortized and recognized as a component of gain (loss) on derivatives on the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe following tables summarize the before-tax effect of the Company\u2019s derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n(1)The Company calculates gain (loss) on derivatives, settled, as the summation of gains and losses on positions that have settled within the period.\n(2)Includes $9 million amortization of premiums paid related to certain natural gas fixed price options for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is included in gain (loss) on derivatives on the consolidated statements of operations.\n(3)Includes $2 million amortization of premiums paid related to certain natural gas three-way costless collars for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is included in gain (loss) on derivatives on the consolidated statements of operations.\n(4)Includes $1 million amortization of premiums paid related to certain natural gas call options for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is included in gain (loss) on derivatives on the consolidated statement of operations.\n(7) RECLASSIFICATIONS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nIn 2020, changes in AOCI primarily related to settlements in the Company's pension and other postretirement benefits. The following tables detail the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the related tax effects, for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n(1)See separate table below for details about these reclassifications.\n(1)See Note 13 for additional details regarding the Company\u2019s pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\n(8) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company\u2019s financial instruments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n(1)In October 2019, the Company amended its 2018 revolving credit facility agreement which, among other things, extended the maturity from 2023 to 2024.\n(2)Excludes unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts.\n(3)Includes $9 million in premiums paid as of December 31, 2019 related to certain natural gas fixed price swaps recognized as a component of derivative assets within current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. As presented in the tables below, this hierarchy consists of three broad levels:\nLevel 1 valuations - Consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and have the highest priority.\nLevel 2 valuations - Consist of quoted market information for the calculation of fair market value.\nLevel 3 valuations - Consist of internal estimates and have the lowest priority.\nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, including marketable securities, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. For debt and derivative instruments, the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair value:\nDebt: The fair values of the Company\u2019s senior notes were based on the market value of the Company\u2019s publicly traded debt as determined based on the market prices of the Company\u2019s senior notes. The fair value of the Company's 4.10% Senior Notes due March 2022 is considered to be a Level 2 measurement on the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of the Company's remaining senior notes are considered to be a Level 1 measurement. The carrying values of the borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility (to the extent utilized) approximates fair value because the interest rate is variable and reflective of market rates. The Company considers the fair value of its revolving credit facility to be a Level 1 measurement on the fair value hierarchy.\nDerivative Instruments: The Company measures the fair value of its derivative instruments based upon a pricing model that utilizes market-based inputs, including, but not limited to, the contractual price of the underlying position, current market prices, natural gas and liquids forward curves, discount rates such as the LIBOR curve for a similar duration of each outstanding position, volatility factors and non-performance risk. Non-performance risk considers the effect of the Company\u2019s credit standing on the fair value of derivative liabilities and the effect of counterparty credit standing on the fair value of derivative assets. Both inputs to the model are based on published credit default swap rates and the duration of each outstanding derivative position. As of December 31, 2020, the impact of non-performance risk on the fair value of the Company\u2019s net derivative liability position was a reduction of the liability of $1 million.\nThe Company has classified its derivative instruments into levels depending upon the data utilized to determine their fair values. The Company\u2019s fixed price swaps (Level 2) are estimated using third-party discounted cash flow calculations using the New York Mercantile Exchange (\u201cNYMEX\u201d) futures index for natural gas and oil derivatives and Oil Price Information Service (\u201cOPIS\u201d) for ethane and propane derivatives. The Company utilizes discounted cash flow models for valuing its interest rate derivatives (Level 2). The net derivative values attributable to the Company\u2019s interest rate derivative contracts as of December 31, 2020 are based on (i) the contracted notional amounts, (ii) active market-quoted London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) yield curves and (iii) the applicable credit-adjusted risk-free rate yield curve.\nThe Company\u2019s call options, two-way costless collars, three-way costless collars and swaptions (Level 2) are valued using the Black-Scholes model, an industry standard option valuation model that takes into account inputs such as contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, including assumptions of the NYMEX and OPIS futures index, interest rates, volatility and credit worthiness. Inputs to the Black-Scholes model, including the volatility input are obtained from a third-party pricing source, with independent verification of the most significant inputs on a monthly basis. An increase (decrease) in volatility would result in an increase (decrease) in fair value measurement, respectively.\nThe Company\u2019s basis swaps (Level 2) are estimated using third-party calculations based upon forward commodity price curves.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:\n(1)Includes $9 million in premiums paid related to certain natural gas fixed price swaps recognized as a component of derivative assets within current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019. As certain natural gas fixed price swaps settle, the premium will be amortized and recognized as a component of gain (loss) on derivatives on the consolidated statement of operations.\nSee Note 13 for a discussion of the fair value measurement of the Company\u2019s pension plan assets.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nOn November 13, 2020, the Company completed the Merger with Montage. See Note 3 for a discussion of the fair value measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nIn 2020, the Company determined that the $6 million carrying value of certain non-core assets exceeded their respective fair value less costs to sell and recognized a $5 million non-cash impairment. The Company used Level 2 measurements to determine the fair value of these assets.\nIn 2019, the Company determined that the $26 million carrying value of certain non-core assets exceeded their respective fair value less costs to sell and recognized a $16 million non-cash impairment. The Company used Level 3 measurements to determine the fair value of these assets.\nIn the third quarter of 2018, the Company determined the carrying value of certain non-full cost pool assets associated with the Fayetteville Shale sale exceeded the fair value less costs to sell. In accordance with accounting guidance for Property, Plant and Equipment, assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Because the assets outside of the full cost pool included in the Fayetteville Shale sale met the criteria for held for sale accounting, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $161 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, of which $145 million related to midstream gathering assets and $15 million related to E&P which were both reflected as assets held for sale in the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, the Company recorded a $1 million non-cash impairment related to other non-core assets that were not included in the sale. The estimated fair value of the gathering assets was based on an estimated discounted cash flow model and market assumptions. The significant Level 3 assumptions used in the calculation of estimated discounted cash flows included future commodity prices, projections of estimated quantities of natural gas reserves, operating costs, projections of future rates of production, inflation factors and risk adjusted discount rates.\n(9) DEBT\nThe components of debt as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following:\n(1)At December 31, 2020 and 2019, unamortized issuance expense of $12 million and $11 million, respectively, associated with the 2018 revolving credit facility (as defined below) was classified as other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\n(2)Effective in July 2018, the interest rate was 6.20% for the 2025 Notes, reflecting a net downgrade in the Company's bond ratings since the initial offering. On April 7, 2020, S&P downgraded the Company's bond rating to BB-, which had the effect of increasing the interest rate on the 2025 Notes to 6.45% following the July 23, 2020 interest payment due date. The first coupon payment to the bondholders at the higher interest rate will be paid in January 2021.\nThe following is a summary of scheduled debt maturities by year as of December 31, 2020:\n(1)The Company\u2019s current revolving credit facility matures in 2024.\nCredit Facilities\n2018 Credit Facility\nIn April 2018, the Company replaced its credit facility entered into in 2016 with a new revolving credit facility (the \u201c2018 credit facility\u201d) with a group of banks that, as amended, has a maturity date of April 2024. The 2018 credit facility has an aggregate maximum revolving credit amount of $3.5 billion with a current aggregate commitment of $2.0 billion and borrowing base (limit on availability) that is redetermined at least each April and October. The 2018 credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets owned by the Company and its subsidiaries. The permitted lien provisions in the senior notes indentures currently limit liens securing indebtedness to the greater of $2.0 billion and 25% of adjusted consolidated net tangible assets.\nThe Company may utilize the 2018 credit facility in the form of loans and letters of credit. Loans under the 2018 credit facility are subject to varying rates of interest based on whether the loan is a Eurodollar loan or an alternate base rate loan. Eurodollar loans bear interest at the Eurodollar rate, which is adjusted LIBOR for such interest period plus the applicable margin (as those terms are defined in the 2018 credit facility documentation). The applicable margin for Eurodollar loans under the 2018 credit facility, as amended, ranges from 1.75% to 2.75% based on the Company\u2019s utilization of the 2018 credit facility. Alternate base rate loans bear interest at the alternate base rate plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin for alternate base rate loans under the 2018 credit facility, as amended, ranges from 0.75% to 1.75% based on the Company\u2019s utilization of the 2018 credit facility.\nIn conjunction with the October 2020 redetermination process, the Company entered into an amendment to the credit agreement governing the 2018 credit facility to, among other matters:\n\u2022limit the Company's unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to $200 million when loans under the 2018 credit facility are outstanding, subject to certain exceptions; and\n\u2022increase the applicable rate by 25 basis points on loans outstanding under the 2018 credit facility.\nIn addition, the following amendments and redeterminations were made upon the closing of the Merger:\n\u2022increase the elected borrowing base and total aggregate commitments to $2.0 billion, the maximum permitted lien amount based on provisions in certain of the Company's senior note indentures;\n\u2022include certain Montage entities owning gas and oil properties as guarantors to the 2018 credit facility; and\n\u2022deem any Montage letters of credit issued prior to the Merger close to have been issued under the 2018 credit facility.\nThe 2018 credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and covenants including, among others, the following:\n\u2022a prohibition against incurring debt, subject to permitted exceptions;\n\u2022a restriction on creating liens on assets, subject to permitted exceptions;\n\u2022restrictions on mergers and asset dispositions;\n\u2022restrictions on use of proceeds, investments, transactions with affiliates, or change of principal business; and\n\u2022maintenance of the following financial covenants, commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2018:\n(1)Minimum current ratio of no less than 1.00 to 1.00, whereby current ratio is defined as the Company\u2019s consolidated current assets (including unused commitments under the credit agreement, but excluding non-cash derivative assets) to consolidated current liabilities (excluding non-cash derivative obligations and current maturities of long-term debt).\n(2)Maximum total net leverage ratio of no greater than, with respect to each fiscal quarter ending on or after June 30, 2020, 4.00 to 1.00. Total net leverage ratio is defined as total debt less cash on hand (up to the lesser of 10% of credit limit or $150 million) divided by consolidated EBITDAX for the last four consecutive quarters. For purposes of calculating consolidated EBITDAX, the Company can include the Montage consolidated EBITDAX prior to the merger for the same twelve-month rolling period. EBITDAX, as defined in the Company\u2019s 2018 credit agreement, excludes the effects of interest expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, income tax, any non-cash impacts from impairments, certain non-cash hedging activities, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash gains or losses on asset sales, unamortized issuance cost, unamortized debt discount and certain restructuring costs.\nThe 2018 credit facility contains customary events of default that include, among other things, the failure to comply with the financial covenants described above, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments and cross-defaults to material indebtedness. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, all amounts outstanding under the 2018 credit facility may become immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants of the credit agreement in all material respects.\nEach United States domestic subsidiary of the Company for which the Company owns 100% of its equity guarantees the 2018 credit facility. Pursuant to requirements under the indentures governing its senior notes, each subsidiary that became a guarantor of the 2018 credit facility also became a guarantor of each of the Company\u2019s senior notes.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $233 million in letters of credit and $700 million in borrowings outstanding under the 2018 credit facility.\nThe Company's exposure to the anticipated transition from LIBOR in late 2021 is limited to the 2018 credit facility. Upon announcement by the administrator of LIBOR identifying a specific date for LIBOR cessation, the credit agreement governing the 2018 credit facility will be amended to reference an alternative rate as established by JP Morgan, as Administrative Agent, and the Company. The alternative rate will be based on the prevailing market convention and is expected to be the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d).\nSenior Notes\nIn January 2015, the Company completed a public offering of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 4.95% Senior Notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d). The interest rate on the 2025 Notes is determined based upon the public bond ratings from Moody\u2019s and S&P. Downgrades on the 2025 Notes from either rating agency increase interest costs by 25 basis points per downgrade level and upgrades decrease interest costs by 25 basis points per upgrade level, up to the stated coupon rate, on the following semi-annual bond interest payment. Effective in July 2018, the interest rate for the 2015 Notes was 6.20%, reflecting a net downgrade in the Company's bond ratings since the initial offering. On April 7, 2020, S&P downgraded the Company's bond rating to BB-, which had the effect of increasing the interest rate on the 2025 Notes to 6.45% following the July 23, 2020 interest payment due date. The first coupon payment to the bondholders at the higher interest rate will be paid in January 2021. In the event of future downgrades, the coupons for this series of notes have been capped at 6.95%.\nIn the second half of 2019, the Company repurchased $35 million of its 4.95% senior notes due 2025, $11 million of its 7.50% Senior Notes due 2026 and $16 million of its 7.75% Senior Notes due 2027 at a discount for $54 million, and recognized an $8 million gain on extinguishment of debt. Additionally, in December 2019, the Company retired the remaining $52 million principal of its 4.05% Senior Notes due January 2020.\nIn the first half of 2020, the Company repurchased $6 million of its 4.10% senior notes due 2022, $36 million of its 4.95% senior notes due 2025, $21 million of its 7.50% senior notes due 2026 and $44 million of its 7.75% senior notes due 2027 for $72 million, and recognized a $35 million gain on the extinguishment of debt.\nIn August 2020, the Company completed a public offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of its 2028 Notes, with net proceeds from the offering totaling approximately $345 million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The 2028 Notes were sold to the public at 100% of their face value. The net proceeds from the notes, in conjunction with the net proceeds from the August 2020 common stock offering and borrowings under the revolving credit facility, were utilized to fund a redemption of $510 million of Montage's Notes in connection with the closing of the Merger.\n(10) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nOperating Commitments and Contingencies\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s contractual obligations for demand and similar charges under firm transportation and gathering agreements to guarantee access capacity on natural gas and liquids pipelines and gathering systems totaled approximately $8.5 billion, $531 million of which related to access capacity on future pipeline and gathering infrastructure projects that still require the granting of regulatory approvals and additional construction efforts. The Company also had guarantee obligations of up to $923 million of that amount. As of December 31, 2020, future payments under non-cancelable firm transportation and gathering agreements are as follows:\n(1)With the close of the Montage Merger the Company acquired firm transportation commitments of approximately $1,100 million. These commitments approximate $99 million within the next year, $197 million from 1 to 3 years, $196 million from 3 to 5 years, $284 million from 5 to 8 years and $324 million beyond 8 years.\n(2)Based on the estimated in-service dates as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company leases pressure pumping equipment for its E&P operations under a single lease that expires in 2021. The current aggregate annual payment under this lease is approximately $6 million. The Company has seven leases for drilling rigs for its E&P operations that expire through 2025 with a current aggregate annual payment of approximately $11 million. The lease payments for the pressure pumping equipment, as well as other operating expenses for the Company\u2019s drilling operations, are capitalized to natural gas and oil properties and are partially offset by billings to third-party working interest owners.\nThe Company leases office space, vehicles and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases expiring through 2036. As of December 31, 2020, future minimum payments under these non-cancelable leases accounted for as operating leases (including short-term) are approximately $30 million in 2021, $21 million in 2022, $18 million in 2023, $14 million in 2024, $12 million in 2025 and $36 million thereafter.\nThe Company also has commitments for compression services and compression rentals related to its E&P segment. As of December 31, 2020, future minimum payments under these non-cancelable agreements (including short-term obligations) are approximately $20 million in 2021, $14 million in 2022, $3 million in 2022 and less than $1 million in 2024.\nIn the first quarter of 2019, the Company agreed to purchase firm transportation with pipelines in the Appalachian basin starting in 2021 and running through 2032 totaling $357 million in total contractual commitments, which is presented in the table above; the seller has agreed to reimburse $133 million of these commitments.\nEnvironmental Risk\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Environmental and cleanup related costs of a non-capital nature are accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management believes any future remediation or other compliance related costs will not have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.\nLitigation\nThe Company is subject to various litigation, claims and proceedings, most of which have arisen in the ordinary course of business such as for alleged breaches of contract, miscalculation of royalties, employment matters, traffic accidents, pollution, contamination, encroachment on others\u2019 property or nuisance. The Company accrues for litigation, claims and proceedings when a liability is both probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2020, the Company does not currently have any material amounts accrued related to litigation matters. For any matters not accrued for, it is not possible at this time to estimate the amount of any additional loss, or range of loss that is reasonably possible, but, based on the nature of the claims, management believes that current litigation, claims and proceedings, individually or in aggregate and after taking into account insurance, are not likely to have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations or cash flows, for the period in which the effect of that outcome becomes reasonably estimable. Many of these matters are in early stages, so the allegations and the damage theories have not been fully developed, and are all subject to inherent uncertainties; therefore, management\u2019s view may change in the future.\nSt. Lucie County Fire District Firefighters\u2019 Pension Trust\nOn October 17, 2016, the St. Lucie County Fire District Firefighters\u2019 Pension Trust filed a putative class action in the 61st District Court in Harris County, Texas, against the Company, certain of its former officers and current and former directors and the underwriters on behalf of itself and others that purchased certain depositary shares from the Company\u2019s January 2015 equity offering, alleging material misstatements and omissions in the registration statement for that offering. The Company removed the case to federal court, but after a decision by the United States Supreme Court in an unrelated case that these types of cases are not subject to removal, the federal court remanded the case to the Texas state court. The Texas trial court denied the Company\u2019s motion to dismiss, and in February 2020, the court of appeals declined to exercise discretion to reverse the trial court\u2019s decision. The Company filed a petition to review the trial court\u2019s decision with the Texas Supreme Court, and the Court requested a response from the plaintiff. The Court subsequently ordered full briefing on the merits of the case. The Company carries insurance for the claims asserted against it and the officer and director defendants, and the carrier has accepted coverage. The Company denies all allegations and intends to continue to defend this case vigorously. The Company does not expect this case to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company. Additionally, it is not possible at this time to estimate the amount of any additional loss, or range of loss, that is reasonably possible.\nIndemnifications\nThe Company has provided certain indemnifications to various third parties, including in relation to asset and entity dispositions, securities offerings and other financings, such as the St. Lucie County Fire District Firefighters\u2019 Pension Trust case described above. In the case of asset dispositions, these indemnifications typically relate to disputes, litigation or tax matters existing at the date of disposition. The Company likewise obtains indemnification for future matters when it sells assets, although there is no assurance the buyer will be capable of performing those obligations. In the case of equity offerings, these indemnifications typically relate to claims asserted against underwriters in connection with an offering. No material liabilities have been recognized in connection with these indemnifications.\n(11) INCOME TAXES\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes included the following components:\nThe provision for income taxes was an effective rate of (15)% in 2020, (86)% in 2019 and 0% in 2018. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate increased in 2020, as compared with 2019, primarily due to the increase in the valuation allowance in 2020. The following reconciles the provision for income taxes included in the consolidated statements of operations with the provision which would result from application of the statutory federal tax rate to pre-tax financial income:\nThe 2020 tax accrual calculated under the estimated annual effective tax rate method reflects the Tax Reform Act changes that took effect January 1, 2018. The components of the Company\u2019s deferred tax balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nThe Tax Reform Act made significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax law affecting the Company. Major changes in this legislation applicable to the Company relate to the reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21%, repeal of the alternative minimum tax, interest deductibility and net operating loss carryforward limitations, changes to certain executive compensation and full expensing provisions related to business assets. The adjustments required to deferred taxes as a result of the Tax Reform Act have been reflected in the Company\u2019s tax provision.\nAs the Tax Reform Act repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and provided for existing alternative minimum tax credit carryovers to be refunded beginning in 2018, the Company has approximately $30 million in refundable credits. Accordingly, in 2017 the valuation allowance in place prior to the Tax Reform Act related to these credits was released, and any credits remaining were reclassed to a receivable. Additionally, in January 2020 the IRS announced that any previously sequestered amounts relating to these alternative minimum tax refunds would also be refunded. The Company had approximately $2 million in sequestered amounts relating to alternative minimum tax refunds. All of those refunds have been received as of December 2020 after the CARES Act (enacted in March 2020) accelerated alternative minimum tax refunds.\nIn 2020, the Company received refunds related to federal income tax of $32 million. The Company received a refund of $1 million in state income tax in 2019 and paid $6.3 million in state income tax in 2018. The Company\u2019s net operating loss carryforward as of December 31, 2020 was $4.5 billion and $2 billion for federal and state reporting purposes, respectively, the majority of which will expire between 2035 and 2039. Included in the Company's net operating loss carryforward are the net operating loss carryforwards acquired in the Montage acquisition of $1 billion. A portion of the Montage-related net operating loss carryovers are subject to an annual section 382 limitation of $1.7 million, and the Company has appropriately accounted for this limitation in purchase accounting. In addition, certain net operating loss carryovers are subject to a section 382 limitation of $90 million, but the Company does not expect this limit to have a material impact on its net operating loss carryforward balance. Additionally, the Company has an income tax net operating loss carryforward related to its Canadian operations of $29 million, with expiration dates of 2030 through 2039. The Company also had a statutory depletion carryforward of $13 million and $55 million related to interest deduction carryforward as of December 31, 2020.\nA valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, is recognized when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To assess that likelihood, the Company uses estimates and judgment regarding future taxable income, and considers the tax consequences in the jurisdiction where such taxable income is generated, to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. Such evidence can include current financial position, results of operations, both actual and forecasted, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies as well as current and forecasted business economics of the oil and gas industry.\nDue to unexpected significant pricing declines resulting from the effects of COVID-19 and developments related to Russia/OPEC, as well as the general oversupply of the market along with the material write-down of the carrying value of the Company\u2019s natural gas and oil properties, in addition to other negative evidence, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized and recorded a discrete tax expense of $408 million for the increase in its valuation allowance in the first quarter of 2020. The net change in valuation allowance is reflected as a component of income tax expense. The Company also has retained a valuation allowance of $87 million related to net operating losses in jurisdictions in which it no longer operates. Management will continue to assess available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted based on changes in subjective estimates of future taxable income or if objective negative evidence is no longer present.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company maintained a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets based on its conclusion, considering all available evidence (both positive and negative), that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized. A significant item of objective negative evidence considered was the cumulative pre-tax loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to non-cash impairments of proved natural gas and oil properties recognized in 2015 and 2016. As of the first quarter of 2019, the Company had sustained a three-year cumulative level of profitability. Based on this factor and other positive evidence including forecasted taxable income, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized and determined that $522 million of the valuation allowance would be released during 2019. Accordingly, a tax benefit of $522 million was recorded.\nA reconciliation of the changes to the valuation allowance is as follows:\nA tax position must meet certain thresholds for any of the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, there were no unrecognized tax positions identified that would have a material effect on the effective tax rate. All positions booked as of December 31, 2018 were released in 2019 due to audit completion and statute expirations.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nThe Internal Revenue Service closed the 2014 audit of the Company\u2019s federal return in 2019 with no change and is currently auditing the Company\u2019s 2016 and 2017 tax periods. The income tax years 2018 to 2020 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.\n(12) ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s 2020 and 2019 activity related to asset retirement obligations:\n(13) RETIREMENT AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\n401(k) Defined Contribution Plan\nThe Company has a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering eligible employees. The Company expensed $2 million, $2 million and $3 million of contribution expense in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Additionally, the Company capitalized $1 million of contributions in 2020 and $1 million and $2 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, directly related to the acquisition, exploration and development activities of the Company\u2019s natural gas and oil properties or directly related to the construction of the Company\u2019s gathering systems.\nDefined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans\nPrior to January 1, 1998, the Company maintained a traditional defined benefit plan with benefits payable based upon average final compensation and years of service. Effective January 1, 1998, the Company amended its pension plan to become a \u201ccash balance\u201d plan on a prospective basis for its non-bargaining employees. A cash balance plan provides benefits based upon a fixed percentage of an employee\u2019s annual compensation. As part of ongoing effort to reduce costs, the Company has elected to freeze its pension plan effective January 1, 2021. Employees that were participants in the pension plan prior to January 1, 2021 will continue to receive the interest component of the plan but will no longer receive the service component. The Company\u2019s funding policy is to contribute amounts which are actuarially determined to provide the plans with sufficient assets to meet future benefit payment requirements and which are tax deductible.\nThe postretirement benefit plan provides contributory health care and life insurance benefits. Employees become eligible for these benefits if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, the benefits paid are a stated percentage of medical expenses reduced by deductibles and other coverages.\nPrior to January 1, 2021, substantially all of the Company\u2019s employees were covered by the defined benefit pension. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s employees continue to be covered by the postretirement benefit plans. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans by recognizing the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan and other postretirement benefit plan on the Company\u2019s balance sheet. In the event a plan is overfunded, the Company recognizes an asset. Conversely, if a plan is underfunded, the Company recognizes a liability.\nIn June 2018, the Company notified affected employees of a workforce reduction plan, which resulted primarily from a previously announced study of structural, process and organizational changes to enhance shareholder value. In December 2018, the Company closed the sale of the equity in certain of its subsidiaries that owned and operated its Fayetteville Shale E&P and related midstream gathering assets in Arkansas. As part of this transaction, many employees associated with those assets were either transferred to the buyer or their employment was terminated. As a result of the restructurings, the Company recognized a curtailment on its pension and other postretirement benefit plans and recognized a non-cash gain of $4 million on its consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. In 2019, the Company recognized a $6 million non-cash settlement loss related to $21 million of lump sum payments as a result of these restructuring events. In 2020, the settlement loss was immaterial.\nThe following provides a reconciliation of the changes in the plans\u2019 benefit obligations, fair value of assets and funded status as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe Company uses a December 31 measurement date for all of its plans and had liabilities recorded for the underfunded status for each period as presented above.\nThe pension plans\u2019 projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nPension and other postretirement benefit costs include the following components for 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nService cost is classified as general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. All other components of total benefit cost (benefit) are classified as other income (loss), net on the consolidated statements of operations.\nAmounts recognized in other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nIncluded in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was a $36 million loss ($28 million net of tax) and a $30 million loss ($22 million net of tax), respectively, related to the Company\u2019s pension and other postretirement benefit plans. For the year ended December 31, 2020, $5 million was classified from accumulated other comprehensive income, primarily driven by actuarial losses. Amortization of prior period service cost reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to general and administrative expenses for the year was immaterial.\nThe amount in accumulated other comprehensive income that is expected to be recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost during 2021 is a $1 million expense.\nThe assumptions used in the measurement of the Company\u2019s benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nThe assumptions used in the measurement of the Company\u2019s net periodic benefit cost for 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\nThe expected return on plan assets for the various benefit plans is based upon a review of the historical returns experienced, combined with the future expected returns based upon the asset allocation strategy employed. The plans seek to achieve an adequate return to fund the obligations in a manner consistent with the federal standards of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and with a prudent level of diversification.\nFor measurement purposes, the following trend rates were assumed for 2020 and 2019:\nAssumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts for the health care plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:\nPension Payments and Asset Management\nIn 2020, the Company contributed $12 million to its pension plans and $1 million to its other postretirement benefit plan. The Company expects to contribute $13 million to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2021.\nThe following benefit payments, which reflect projected future interest costs, are expected to be paid:\nThe Company\u2019s overall investment strategy is to provide an adequate pool of assets to support both the long-term growth of plan assets and to ensure adequate liquidity exists for the near-term payment of benefit obligations to participants, retirees and beneficiaries. The Benefits Administration Committee of the Company, appointed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, administers the Company\u2019s pension plan assets. The Benefits Administration Committee believes long-term investment performance is a function of asset-class mix and restricts the composition of pension plan assets to a combination of cash and cash equivalents, domestic equity markets, international equity markets or investment grade fixed income assets.\nThe table below presents the allocations targeted by the Benefits Administration Committee and the actual weighted-average asset allocation of the Company\u2019s pension plan as of December 31, 2020, by asset category. The asset allocation targets are subject to change and the Benefits Administration Committee allows for its actual allocations to deviate from target as a result of current and anticipated market conditions. Plan assets are periodically balanced whenever the allocation to any asset class falls outside of the specified range.\n(1)Includes the following equity securities in the table below: U.S. large cap growth equity, U.S. large cap value equity, U.S. large cap core equity, and U.S. small cap equity.\n(2)Includes Non-U.S. equity securities in the table below.\n(3)Includes fixed income pension plan assets in the table below.\n(4)Includes Cash and cash equivalent pension plan assets in the table below.\nUtilizing the fair value hierarchy described in Note 8, the Company\u2019s fair value measurement of pension plan assets as of December 31, 2020 is as follows:\nNote: Footnotes are located after the prior year comparative table below.\nUtilizing the fair value hierarchy described in Note 8, the Company\u2019s fair value measurement of pension plan assets at December 31, 2019 was as follows:\n(1)Mutual fund that seeks to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks that will increase in value over the long-term as well as provide current income.\n(2)An institutional fund that seeks to replicate the performance of the S&P 500 Index before fees.\n(3)Mutual fund that seeks to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks with small market capitalizations.\n(4)Mutual funds that invest primarily in equity securities of companies domiciled outside of the United States, primarily in developed markets.\n(5)Institutional funds that seek an investment return that approximates, as closely as practicable, before expenses, the performance of the Barclays U.S. Intermediate Credit Bond Index over the long term and the Barclays Long U.S. Corporate Bond Index over the long-term.\n(6)Plan assets for which fair value was measured using net asset value as a practical expedient.\n(7)An institutional fund that seeks to invest in companies with sustainable competitive advantages, as identified through proprietary research.\n(8)Mutual fund that seeks to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks with price appreciation growth opportunities.\nThe Company\u2019s pension plan assets that are classified as Level 1 are the investments comprised of either cash or investments in open-ended mutual funds which produce a daily net asset value that is validated with a sufficient level of observable activity to support classification of the fair value measurement as Level 1. Due to the Company\u2019s implementation of Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-07, assets measured using net asset value as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. No concentration of risk arising within or across categories of plan assets exists due to any significant investments in a single entity, industry, country or investment fund.\n(14) LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION\nThe Southwestern Energy Company 2013 Incentive Plan was adopted in February 2013, approved by stockholders in May 2013 and amended and restated per stockholders\u2019 approval in May 2016 and further amended in May 2017 and May 2019 (the \u201c2013 Plan\u201d). The 2013 Plan provides for the compensation of officers, key employees and eligible non-employee directors of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nThe 2013 Plan provides for grants of options, stock appreciation rights, and shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees, officers and directors that, in the aggregate, do not exceed 88,700,000 shares. The types of incentives that may be awarded are comprehensive and are intended to enable the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to structure the most appropriate incentives and to address changes in income tax laws which may be enacted over the term of the 2013 Plan.\nThe Company\u2019s stock-based compensation is classified as either equity or liability awards in accordance with GAAP. The fair value of an equity-classified award is determined at the grant date and is amortized to general and administrative expense and capitalized expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. The fair value of a liability-classified award is determined on a quarterly basis beginning at the grant date until final vesting. Changes in the fair value of liability-classified awards are recorded to general and administrative expense over the vesting period of the award. A portion of this general and administrative expense is capitalized into natural gas and oil properties, included in property and equipment. Generally, stock options granted to employees and directors vest ratably over three years from the grant date and expire seven years from the date of grant. The Company issues shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units to employees and directors which generally vest over four years. Restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options granted to participants under the 2013 Plan, as amended and restated, immediately vest upon death, disability or retirement (subject to a minimum of three years of service). The Company issues performance units which have historically vested over three years to employees. The performance units granted in 2018, 2019 and 2020 cliff-vest at the end of three years.\nIn June 2018, the Company announced a workforce reduction. Unvested stock-based awards of the affected employees were subsequently cancelled and the approximate fair value of a portion of those cancelled awards was included in a cash severance payment that was paid in the third quarter of 2018. Stock-based compensation costs recognized prior to the cancellation as either general and administrative expense or capitalized expense were reversed and the severance payments were subsequently recognized as restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2018 on the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn December 2018, the Company closed the Fayetteville Shale sale. As part of this transaction, most employees associated with those assets became employees of the buyer although the employment of some was terminated. All affected employees were offered a severance package, which included a one-time cash payment depending on length of service and, if applicable, the current value of a portion of equity awards that were forfeited. Stock-based compensation costs recognized prior to the cancellation as either general and administrative expense or capitalized expense were reversed and the severance payments were subsequently recognized as restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 on the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn February 2020, the Company announced a strategic realignment of the Company\u2019s organizational structure. Affected employees were offered a severance package, which included a one-time payment depending on length of service and, if applicable, the current value of unvested long-term incentive awards that were forfeited. The Company also recognized additional severance costs in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to continued organizational restructuring. Stock-based compensation costs recognized prior to the cancellation as either general and administrative expense or capitalized expense were reversed and the severance payments were subsequently recognized as restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2020 on the consolidated statements of operations.\nEquity-Classified Awards\nEquity-Classified Stock Options\nThe Company recorded the following compensation costs related to stock options for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nThe Company recorded no deferred tax assets related to stock options for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to deferred tax assets of less than $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Additionally, the Company had no unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options at December 31, 2020.\nThe fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of the grant using a Black-Scholes valuation model that uses the weighted average assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock and other factors. The Company uses historical data on the exercise of stock options, post-vesting forfeitures and other factors to estimate the expected term of the stock-based payments granted. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company did not issue equity-classified stock options in 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nThe following tables summarize stock option activity for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018, and provide information for options outstanding at December 31 of each year:\nNo options were granted or exercised in 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nEquity-Classified Restricted Stock\nThe Company recorded the following compensation costs related to restricted stock grants for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nThe Company also recorded deferred tax asset of $2 million related to restricted stock for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a reduction in the deferred tax assets of less than $1 million and deferred tax asset of $2 million for the years end\n2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, there was $1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested shares of restricted stock that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of less than one year.\nThe following table summarizes the restricted stock activity for the years 2020, 2019 and 2018, and provides information for restricted stock outstanding at December 31 of each year:\n(1)Includes 171,813 shares forfeited as a result of the reduction in workforce for the year end December 31, 2020.\n(2)Includes 65,196 shares forfeited as a result of the reduction in workforce for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(3)Includes 1,287,636 shares forfeited as a result of the reduction in workforce for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe fair values of the grants were $2 million for 2020, $2 million for 2019 and $2 million for 2018. The total fair value of shares vested were $6 million for 2020, $11 million for 2019 and $19 million for 2018.\nEquity-Classified Restricted Stock Units\nAs a result of the Merger with Montage, certain Montage employees became employees of Southwestern and retained their original equity awards. The amount of compensation costs related these equity-classified restricted stock units recorded by the Company was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, there was less than $1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested equity-classified restricted stock units that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately one year.\nThe following table summarizes equity-classified restricted stock unit activity to be paid out in Company stock for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nEquity-Classified Performance Units\nThe Company recorded compensation costs related to equity-classified performance units for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The performance units awarded in 2017 included a market condition based on relative Total Shareholder Return (\u201cTSR\u201d). The grant date fair value is calculated using the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock at the grant date and a Monte Carlo model to estimate the TSR market condition. The estimated fair value is amortized to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. There were no equity-classified performance units awarded in 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nThe Company also recorded a deferred tax asset of less than $1 million related to equity-classified performance units for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to deferred tax assets of less than $1 million and $1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, there are no more equity-classified performance units outstanding.\nThe following table summarizes equity-classified performance unit activity to be paid out in Company stock for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, and provides information for unvested units as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n(1)These amounts reflect the number of performance units granted in thousands. The actual payout of shares may range from a minimum of zero shares to a maximum of two shares per unit contingent upon TSR. The performance units have a three-year vesting term and the actual disbursement of shares, if any, is determined during the first quarter following the end of the three-year vesting period.\n(2)Includes 41,761 units related to the reduction in workforce for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(3)Includes 144,927 units related to the reduction in workforce for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLiability-Classified Awards\nLiability-Classified Restricted Stock Units\nIn the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, the Company granted restricted stock units that vest over a period of four years and are payable in either cash or shares at the option of the Compensation Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. The Company has accounted for these as liability-classified awards, and accordingly changes in the market value of the instruments will be recorded to general and administrative expense and capitalized expense over the vesting period of the award.\nThe Company also recorded deferred tax assets of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to less than $1 million and $2 million related to liability-classified restricted stock units for the years ended 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, there was $22 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to liability-classified restricted stock units that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years. The amount of unrecognized compensation cost for liability-classified awards will fluctuate over time as they are marked to market.\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity to be paid out in cash for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and provides information for unvested units as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n(1)Includes 2,010,196 units related to the reduction in workforce for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(2)Includes 400,056 units related to the reduction in workforce for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(3)Includes 2,766,610 units related to the reduction in workforce for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nLiability-Classified Performance Units\nIn 2020, 2019 and 2018 the Company granted performance units that vest at the end of, or over, a three-year period and are payable in either cash or shares at the option of the Compensation Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. The\nCompany has accounted for these as liability-classified awards, and accordingly changes in the fair market value of the instruments will be recorded to general and administrative expense and capitalized expense over the vesting period of the awards. The performance unit awards granted in 2018 include a performance condition based on cash flow per debt-adjusted share and two market conditions, one based on absolute TSR and the other on relative TSR as compared to a group of the Company\u2019s peers. The performance unit awards granted in 2019 include a performance condition based on return on average capital employed and two market conditions, one based on absolute TSR and the other on relative TSR. The performance unit awards granted in 2020 include a performance condition based on return on average capital employed and a market condition based on relative TSR. The fair values of all market conditions discussed above are calculated by Monte Carlo models on a quarterly basis.\nThe Company also recorded deferred tax assets of $2 million related to liability-classified performance units for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a reduction of deferred tax asset of less than $1 million and a deferred tax asset of $1 million for the years ended 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, there was $14 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to liability-classified performance units. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years. The amount of unrecognized compensation cost for liability-classified awards will fluctuate over time as they are marked to market. The final value of the performance unit awards is contingent upon the Company\u2019s actual performance against the Performance Measures.\nThe following table summarizes liability-classified performance unit activity to be paid out in cash or stock for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and provides information for unvested units as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n(1)Includes 518,450 units related to the reduction in workforce for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(2)Includes 375,086 units related to the reduction in workforce for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(3)Includes 295,160 units related to the reduction in workforce for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCash-Based Compensation\nPerformance Cash Awards\nIn 2020, the Company granted performance cash awards that vest over a four-year period and are payable in cash on an annual basis. The value of each unit of the award equal one dollar. The Company recognizes the cost of these awards as general and administrative expense, operating expense and capitalized expense over the vesting period of the awards. The performance cash awards granted in 2020 include a performance condition determined annually by the Company. In 2020, the performance measure is a targeted discretionary cash flow amount. If the Company, in its sole discretion, determines that the threshold was not met, the amount for that vesting period will not vest and will be cancelled.\n(1) Includes 945,500 units related to the reduction in workforce for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe Company also recorded a deferred tax asset of $1 million related to performance cash awards for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 there was $14 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to performance cash awards. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average 3.2 years. The final value of the performance cash awards is contingent upon the Company's actual performance against these performance measures.\n(15) SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company\u2019s reportable business segments have been identified based on the differences in products or services provided. Revenues for the E&P segment are derived from the production and sale of natural gas and liquids. The Marketing segment generates revenue through the marketing of both Company and third-party produced natural gas and liquids volumes.\nSummarized financial information for the Company\u2019s reportable segments is shown in the following table. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1. Management evaluates the performance of its segments based on operating income, defined as operating revenues less operating costs. Income before income taxes, for the purpose of reconciling the operating income amount shown below to consolidated income before income taxes, is the sum of operating income (loss), interest expense, gain (loss) on derivatives, gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt and other income (loss). The \u201cOther\u201d column includes items not related to the Company\u2019s reportable segments, including real estate and corporate items.\n(1)Operating income for the E&P segment includes $16 million of restructuring charges and $41 million of acquisition-related charges for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(2)Interest expense and the provision (benefit) for income taxes by segment are an allocation of corporate amounts as they are incurred at the corporate level.\n(3)E&P assets includes office, technology, water infrastructure, drilling rigs and other ancillary equipment not directly related to natural gas and oil properties. This also includes deferred tax assets which are an allocation of corporate amounts as they are incurred at the corporate level.\n(4)Capital investments include a decrease of $3 million for 2020, an increase of $34 million for 2019 and a decrease of $53 million for 2018 related to the change in accrued expenditures between years.\n(5)Operating income for the E&P segment includes $11 million of restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(6)Includes the impact of approximately eleven months of Fayetteville Shale-related E&P and midstream gathering operations which were divested in December 2018.\n(7)Operating income for the E&P segment includes $37 million related to restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n(8)Marketing includes a $10 million non-cash impairment related to certain non-core midstream gathering assets at December 31, 2018.\n(9)Operating income for the Marketing segment includes $2 million related to restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe following table presents the breakout of other assets, which represent corporate assets not allocated to segments and assets for non-reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nIncluded in intersegment revenues of the Marketing segment are $1.2 billion, $1.6 billion and $2.3 billion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for marketing of the Company\u2019s E&P sales. Corporate assets include cash and cash equivalents, furniture and fixtures and other costs. Corporate general and administrative costs, depreciation expense and taxes other than income are allocated to the segments.\nSUPPLEMENTAL QUARTERLY RESULTS (UNAUDITED)\nThe following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nSUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURES (UNAUDITED)\nThe Company\u2019s operating natural gas and oil properties are located solely in the United States. The Company also has licenses to properties in Canada, the development of which is subject to an indefinite moratorium. See \u201cOur Operations - Other - New Brunswick, Canada\u201d in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Annual Report.\nNet Capitalized Costs\nThe following table shows the capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties and the related accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nNatural gas and oil properties not subject to amortization represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects in which the Company owns an interest. These unproved property costs include unevaluated costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests and unevaluated costs associated with wells in progress. The table below sets forth the composition of net unevaluated costs excluded from amortization as of December 31, 2020:\nOf the total net unevaluated costs excluded from amortization as of December 31, 2020, approximately $1.1 billion is related to undeveloped properties in Southwest Appalachia (acquired in 2014 and 2015), $88 million is related to the recently acquired Montage properties and approximately $6 million is related to the acquisition of undeveloped properties in Northeast Appalachia. Additionally, the Company has approximately $188 million of unevaluated capitalized interest and $61 million of unevaluated costs related to wells in progress. The remaining costs excluded from amortization are related to properties which are not individually significant and on which the evaluation process has not been completed. The timing and amount of property acquisition and seismic costs included in the amortization computation will depend on the location and timing of drilling wells, results of drilling and other assessments. The Company is, therefore, unable to estimate when these costs will be included in the amortization computation.\nCosts Incurred in Natural Gas and Oil Exploration and Development\nThe table below sets forth capitalized costs incurred in natural gas and oil property acquisition, exploration and development activities:\n(1)Excludes $90 million of unevaluated property acquisition costs associated with the non-cash Montage Merger.\nCapitalized interest is included as part of the cost of natural gas and oil properties. The Company capitalized $88 million, $109 million and $115 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, based on the Company\u2019s weighted average cost of borrowings used to finance expenditures.\nIn addition to capitalized interest, the Company capitalized internal costs totaling $56 million, $77 million and $90 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which were directly related to the acquisition, exploration and development of the Company\u2019s natural gas and oil properties.\nResults of Operations from Natural Gas and Oil Producing Activities\nThe table below sets forth the results of operations from natural gas and oil producing activities:\n(1)Prior to the recognition of a valuation allowance, in 2020 and 2018 the Company recognized an income tax provision (benefit) of ($624) million and $254 million, respectively.\n(2)Results of operations exclude the gain (loss) on unsettled commodity derivative instruments. See Note 6.\nThe results of operations shown above exclude general and administrative expenses and interest expense and are not necessarily indicative of the contribution made by the Company\u2019s natural gas and oil operations to its consolidated operating results. Income tax expense is calculated by applying the statutory tax rates to the revenues less costs, including depreciation, depletion and amortization, and after giving effect to permanent differences and tax credits.\nNatural Gas and Oil Reserve Quantities\nThe Company engaged the services of Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., or NSAI, an independent petroleum engineering firm, to audit the reserves estimated by the Company\u2019s reservoir engineers. In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of NSAI studied the Company\u2019s major properties in detail and independently developed reserve estimates. NSAI\u2019s audit consists primarily of substantive testing, which includes a detailed review of the Company\u2019s major properties, and accounted for approximately 97% of the present worth of the Company\u2019s total proved reserves as of December 31 of 2020. For 2019 and 2018, NSAI\u2019s audit accounted for 99% of the present worth of the Company\u2019s total proved properties. A reserve audit is not the same as a financial audit, and a reserve audit is less rigorous in nature than a reserve report prepared by an independent petroleum engineering firm containing its own estimate of reserves. Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise, and the Company\u2019s reserve estimates are generally based upon extrapolation of historical production trends, historical prices of natural gas and crude oil and analogy to similar properties and volumetric calculations. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s estimates are expected to change, and such changes could be material and occur in the near term as future information becomes available.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the Company\u2019s proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves for 2020, 2019 and 2018, all of which were located in the United States:\n(1)The 2018 disposition is primarily associated with the Fayetteville Shale sale.\n(2)For the year ended December 31, 2019, revisions of previous estimates other than price includes 109 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves reclassified to unproved due to changes in the drilling plan, in accordance with the SEC five-year rule.\n(3)The 2020 acquisition is primarily associated with the Montage Merger.\nThe Company\u2019s estimated proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves were 11,990 Bcfe at December 31, 2020, compared to 12,721 Bcfe at December 31, 2019. The Company\u2019s reserves decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, as acquisitions, non-price revisions, positive extensions, discoveries and other additions in Appalachia were more than offset by negative price revisions and production. The increase in non-price revisions at December 31, 2020 resulted primarily from increased well performance and lower operating costs.\nThe increase in the Company\u2019s reserves in 2019 primarily resulted from the positive extensions, discoveries, other additions and revisions in Appalachia were only partially offset by negative price revisions. The decrease in the Company\u2019s reserves in 2018 primarily resulted from the disposition of the reserves related to the Fayetteville Shale and was only partially offset by positive extensions, discoveries, other additions and revisions in Appalachia.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in reserves for 2018, 2019 and 2020:\n(1)The Fayetteville Shale E&P assets and associated reserves were divested in December 2018.\n(2)Other includes properties outside of Appalachia and Fayetteville Shale.\n(3)Performance and production revisions for the year ended December 31, 2019 include 109 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves reclassified to unproved due to changes in the drilling plan, in accordance with the SEC five-year rule.\nThe Company\u2019s December 31, 2020 proved reserves included 2,437 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves from 138 locations that had a positive present value on an undiscounted basis in compliance with proved reserve requirements, but do not have a positive present value when discounted at 10%. These properties had a negative present value of $207 million when discounted at 10%. The Company made a final investment decision and is committed to developing these reserves within the next five years from the date of initial booking.\nThe Company\u2019s December 31, 2019 proved reserves included 929 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves from 90 locations that had a positive present value on an undiscounted basis in compliance with proved reserve requirements, but that have a negative $50 million present value when discounted at 10%. The Company\u2019s December 31, 2018 proved reserves included 190\nBcfe of proved undeveloped reserves from 30 locations that had a positive present value on an undiscounted basis in compliance with proved reserve requirements, but that have a negative $24 million present value when discounted at 10%.\nThe Company has no reserves from synthetic gas, synthetic oil or nonrenewable natural resources intended to be upgraded into synthetic gas or oil. The Company used standard engineering and geoscience methods, or a combination of methodologies in determining estimates of material properties, including performance and test date analysis, offset statistical analogy of performance data, volumetric evaluation, including analysis of petrophysical parameters (including porosity, net pay, fluid saturations (i.e., water, oil and gas) and permeability) in combination with estimated reservoir parameters (including reservoir temperature and pressure, formation depth and formation volume factors), geological analysis, including structure and isopach maps and seismic analysis, including review of 2-D and 3-D data to ascertain faults, closure and other factors.\nStandardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows\nThe following standardized measures of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are calculated after income taxes, discounted using a 10% annual discount rate and do not purport to present the fair market value of the Company\u2019s proved gas, oil and NGL reserves:\n(1)Includes abandonment costs.\nUnder the standardized measure, future cash inflows were estimated by applying an average price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months, adjusted for known contractual changes, to the estimated future production of year-end proved reserves. Prices used for the standardized measure above were as follows:\nFuture cash inflows were reduced by estimated future production and development costs based on year-end costs to determine pre-tax cash inflows. Future income taxes were computed by applying the year-end statutory rate to the excess of pre-tax cash inflows over the Company\u2019s tax basis in the associated proved gas and oil properties after giving effect to permanent differences and tax credits.\nFollowing is an analysis of changes in the standardized measure during 2020, 2019 and 2018:",

Each restricted stock unit that vests will entitle the holder to receive, payable in common stock or cash at the Compensation Committee\u2019s option, a value based on the closing stock price on the date of vesting. 33% of the restricted stock units vest on each of the first through the third anniversaries of the date of grant, provided the grantee is still an employee of the Company on the vesting date; however, all restricted stock units vest in the case of the grantee\u2019s retirement, death or disability or upon a change in control, all as defined in the Plan.\nPerformance Units.

The vesting date is the third anniversary of the date of grant, provided the grantee is still an employee of the Company on the vesting date; however, a pro rata portion of performance units vest in the case of the grantee\u2019s retirement, death or disability, as defined in the Plan. Upon a change in control, as defined in the Plan, the performance period is deemed to end upon the change of control, and each unit granted vests at the greater of target value and actual value based on the results of the performance measures. The determination of the value of each unit, 0-200%, is based on the achievement of threshold, target or maximum goals for the following metric over a three-year performance period, being the calendar years 2021-2023:\n\u2022Relative Total Shareholder Return - The difference between (a) the average of the closing prices for the Company\u2019s common stock on the last 20 trading days of 2023 plus all dividends paid on account of one share of the Company\u2019s common stock and (b) the average of the closing prices for the last 20 trading days of 2020, as compared to the same calculation for a specified group of the Company\u2019s peers.\nPerformance Cash Units.

The vesting date is the third anniversary of the date of grant, provided the grantee is still an employee of the Company on the vesting date; however, a pro rata portion of performance units vest in the case of the grantee\u2019s retirement, death or disability, as defined in the Plan. Upon a change in control, as defined in the Plan, the performance period is deemed to end upon the change of control, and each unit granted vests at the greater of the target value and actual value based on the results of the performance measures. The determination of the value of each unit, 0-200%, is based on the achievement of threshold, target or maximum goals on the following metrics over a three-year performance period, being the calendar years 2021-2023:\n\u202250% Return on Capital Employed - The sum of (A) net income (loss) adjusted for gain/loss on unsettled derivatives, gain/loss on early extinguishment of debt, gain/loss on sale of assets, impairments, restructuring and transaction-related charges, legal settlements, other one-time charges, adjustments due to discrete tax items, changes from the tax rate in effect at the beginning of the performance period, and the tax effect on adjustments (\u201cAdjusted Net Income\u201d) and (B) interest expense less the product of (i) the interest expense and (ii) the Company\u2019s corporate tax rate in effect at the beginning of the performance period before the impact of valuation allowance divided by the sum of (C) the arithmetic average of the aggregate outstanding principal balance under debt instruments on December 31 of the year prior to the beginning of the performance period and December 31 of the final year of the performance period and (D) the arithmetic average of (i) stockholders\u2019 equity on December 31 of the year prior to the beginning of the performance period (\u201cStockholder\u2019s Equity\u201d) and (ii) the sum of (a) Stockholder\u2019s Equity and (b) Adjusted Net Income for each year during the performance period adjusted by changes reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity less Net Income (Loss).\n\u202250% Reinvestment Rate -total capital investments accrued for in a given year divided by cash flow from operating activities adjusted for changes in assets, liabilities, restructuring and other one-time charges.\nWilliam J.
