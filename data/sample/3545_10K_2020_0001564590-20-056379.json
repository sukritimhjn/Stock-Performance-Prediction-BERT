Unless explicitly stated herein, the information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company disclaims any such incorporation by reference.\nOverview\nAlico is an agribusiness with a legacy of achievement and innovation in citrus and conservation. The Company owns approximately 100,000 acres of land in eight Florida counties (Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Glades, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands and Polk), holding mineral rights on approximately 90,000 acres of those owned acres. Our principal lines of business are citrus groves and conservation.\nAlico is one of the largest citrus producers in the United States of America.\nAlico, Inc. operates two divisions: Alico Citrus, a citrus producer, and Land Management and Other Operations, which includes land conservation, encompassing environmental services, land leasing and related support operations.\nThe Company manages its land based upon its primary usage and reviews its performance based upon two primary classifications - Alico Citrus and Land Management and Other Operations. Land Management and Other Operations include leases for grazing rights, hunting leases, a farm lease, a lease to a third party of an aggregate mine, leases of oil extraction rights to third parties, and other miscellaneous operations generating income. Alico presents its financial results and the related discussion based upon its two business segments: (i) Alico Citrus and (ii) Land Management and Other Operations.\nRecent Developments\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the current novel coronavirus outbreak (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) to be a global pandemic. In response to this declaration and the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the United States, federal, state and local governments throughout the country have imposed varying degrees of restrictions on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the illness. These measures have had a significant adverse impact upon many sectors of the economy, including certain agriculture businesses.\nDuring March 2020, as a precautionary measure to ensure financial flexibility and maintain maximum liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company implemented several measures that we believed would ensure sufficient liquidity for the next several months, including drawing down an aggregate of $70,000,000 on its revolving credit facilities. This decision was made to safeguard the Company\u2019s liquidity and to increase available cash on hand in the event that a more protracted COVID-19 outbreak were to put a significant strain on the financial institutions and their ability to loan funds. As of September 30, 2020, the Company, believing that, despite the protracted COVID-19 outbreak, the financial institution industry was experiencing less negative impact from the outbreak than originally expected, proceeded to pay down the majority of the amounts drawn under its revolving credit facilities.\nAdditionally, for the protection of our employees in accordance with the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, the Company arranged to have the majority of office personnel work remotely, has taken steps to allow and encourage greater separation for our employed and contracted field workers and has worked with its harvesters, haulers and suppliers to minimize interactions. The Company continues to assess the situation on a routine basis.\nTo date, the Company has experienced no material adverse impacts from this pandemic.\nSale and Purchase of Land\nOn September 11, 2020, the Company sold approximately 10,700 acres on the western part of Alico Ranch to the State of Florida for $28,500,000. A portion of these proceeds were used to purchase approximately 3,280 gross citrus acres for $16,450,000 on October 30, 2020. The purchase of these gross citrus acres was structured to allow the Company to defer income taxes of approximately $4,000,000 from the gain on sale of the approximate 10,700 acres sold to the State of Florida.\nCitrus Grove Management Agreement\nOn July 16, 2020, the Company executed an agreement with an affiliated group of third parties to provide citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services for approximately 7,000 acres owned by such third parties. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company is to be reimbursed by the third parties for all of its costs incurred related to providing these services and also receives a management fee based on acres covered under this agreement.\nAgreements with Tropicana\nOn each of May 18, 2020 and May 20, 2020, the Company entered into a new agreement to supply Tropicana, its largest customer, with citrus fruit. These new agreements are effective October 1, 2020, conclude on July 31, 2024, and succeed an existing agreement that expired at the end of September 2020.\nFederal Relief Program\nThe Company has been eligible for Hurricane Irma federal relief programs for block grants that are being administered through the State of Florida. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company received approximately $4,629,000 and $15,597,000, respectively, under the Florida Citrus Recovery Block Grant (\u201cCRBG\u201d) program. This represents the Part 1 and Part 2 reimbursement under a three-part program. The timing and amount to be received under Part 3 of the program, if any, has not been finalized.\nDistribution of Shares by 734 Investors\nOn November 14, 2019, 734 Investors filed a Form 4 and an amendment to Schedule 13D with the SEC disclosing that on November 12, 2019, it distributed all of its shares of Company common stock previously held by it, consisting of 3,173,405 shares, on a pro rata basis, to its members. Prior to such distribution, 734 Investors was the Company\u2019s largest shareholder.\nEmployee and Board of Directors Matters\nOn August 6, 2020, the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) of the Company increased the number of its directors by two and appointed Mr. Adam Putnam and Ms. Kate English as directors, each to serve until the 2021 annual meeting of the Company\u2019s shareholders or until his or her earlier death, resignation, or removal in accordance with the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company.\nIn December 2019, Mr. George R. Brokaw, the then Executive Vice Chairman, informed the Board of Directors that he would voluntarily step down as Executive Vice Chairman effective December 31, 2019 and that change has taken effect. After the effectiveness of this change, Mr. Brokaw has remained a member of the Board of Directors.\nEffective February 27, 2020 (which was immediately after the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders), by way of action that has been taken by and at the direction of the Board of Directors, Benjamin D. Fishman, the non-employee Executive Chairman, became the Chairman of the Board. Mr. Fishman has remained a non-employee director.\nThe Land We Manage\nWe regularly review our land holdings to determine the best use of each parcel based upon our management expertise. Our total return profile is a combination of operating income potential and long-term appreciation. Land holdings not meeting our total return criteria are considered surplus to our operations and efforts are being made to sell such land holdings or to exchange such land holdings for land considered to be more compatible with our business objectives and total return profile.\nOur land holdings and the operating activities in which we engage are categorized in the following table:\nAlico Citrus\nWe own and manage citrus land in DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, and Hardee Counties in the State of Florida and engage in the cultivation of citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the fresh and processed citrus markets. Alico citrus groves total approximately 45,507 gross acres or 45.6% of our land holdings. The Company also manages approximately 7,200 acres of citrus land on behalf of third-party grove owners in addition to the 45,507 gross acres owned by Alico.\nOur citrus acreage is further detailed in the following table:\nOf the 45,507 gross acres of citrus land we own and manage, approximately 12,507 acres are classified as support and other acreage. Support and other acreage include acres used for roads, barns, water detention, water retention and drainage ditches integral to the cultivation of citrus trees, but which are not capable of directly producing fruit. In addition, we own a small citrus tree nursery of approximately 22 acres and utilize the trees produced in our own operations. The 32,978 remaining acres are classified as net plantable acres. Net plantable acres are those that are capable of directly producing fruit. These include acres that are currently producing, acres that are developing (i.e., acres that are planted with trees too young to commercially produce fruit) and acres that are fallow.\nIn an effort to replace trees lost in Hurricane Irma and increase the density of our citrus groves, Alico has planted more than 1.3 million new trees over the past four years. This level of planting has been substantially higher than the normal level of tree attrition. We will continue to evaluate the density throughout our groves and determine the appropriate tree plantings moving forward. Typically, citrus trees become fruit bearing approximately four years after planting and peak around seven to eight years after planting.\nOur Alico Citrus business segment cultivates citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the processed and fresh citrus markets. Our sales to the processed market were approximately 91.0%, 95.0%, and 93.7% of Alico Citrus revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We produce Early and Mid-Season varieties, primarily Hamlin oranges, as well as a Valencia variety for the processed market. We deliver our fruit to the processors in boxes which each contains approximately 90 pounds of oranges. Because the processors convert the majority of the citrus crop into orange juice, they generally do not buy their citrus on a per box basis, but rather on a pound solids basis, which is the measure of the soluble solids (sugars and acids) contained in one box of citrus fruit. We produced approximately 43,578,000, 46,727,000, and 26,513,000 pound solids for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, from boxes delivered to processing plants of approximately 7,311,000, 7,904,000, and 4,702,000, respectively. As previously indicated, the falloff in fiscal year 2018 was mostly attributable to the impact of Hurricane Irma.\nThe average pound solids per box was 5.96, 5.91, and 5.64 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe generally use multi-year contracts with citrus processors that include pricing structures based on a floor and ceiling price. Therefore, if pricing in the market is favorable relative to our floor price, we benefit from the incremental difference between the floor and the final market price to the extent it does not exceed the ceiling price.\nOur citrus produced for the processed citrus market in fiscal year 2020 under our largest agreement was subject to floor prices and ceiling prices. Under this agreement, if the market price was below the floor prices or exceeded the ceiling prices, then 50% of the shortfall or excess was deducted from the floor price or added to the ceiling price. Under our next largest agreement, our citrus produced is subject to a minimum floor price and maximum ceiling price and is a based on a cost-plus structure.\nOn each of May 18, 2020 and May 20, 2020, the Company entered into two new agreements to supply Tropicana, its largest customer, with citrus fruit. These new agreements are effective October 1, 2020, conclude on July 31, 2024, and succeeded our existing largest agreement with this customer which expired at the end of September 2020.\nAlthough we believe other markets and customers are available for our citrus products, we also believe that new arrangements in these other markets or with other customers may be less favorable than our current contracts.\nOur sales to the fresh citrus market constituted approximately 2.6%, 3.0%, and 2.6% of our Alico Citrus revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We produce numerous varieties for the fresh fruit market including grapefruit, navel and other fresh varieties. Generally, our fresh fruit is sold to packing houses by the box and the packing houses are responsible for the harvest and haul of these boxes. We produced approximately 267,000, 210,000, and 125,000 fresh fruit boxes for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOn July 16, 2020, the Company executed an agreement with an affiliated group of third parties to provide citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services (\u201cGrove Management Services\u201d) for approximately 7,000 acres owned by such third parties. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is reimbursed by the third parties for all of its costs incurred related to providing these services and also is to receive a management fee based on acres covered under this agreement. The Company, prior to this agreement, was already providing Grove Management Services to several small third-party grove owners on acres within the Company\u2019s groves and continues to provide such services. Revenues generated from our Grove Management Services were approximately 5.1%, 1.1% and 2.3% of our total operating revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nRevenues from our Alico Citrus operations were approximately 96.6%, 97.4%, and 96.1% of our total operating revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLand Management and Other Operations\nWe own and manage land in Collier, Glades, and Hendry Counties and are engaged in land leasing for recreational and grazing purposes, conservation, and mining activities. Our Land Management and Other Operations land holdings total 54,253 gross acres, or 54.4% of our total acreage.\nOur Land Management and Other Operations acreage is detailed in the following table as of September 30, 2020:\nOn September 11, 2020, the Company sold approximately 10,700 acres on the western part of Alico Ranch to the State of Florida. Because the acres involved in the sale would have been critical to our planned dispersed water storage project, the Company has decided to no longer pursue permit approval activities for this project. As a result of this decision to no longer pursue permit approval activities for this project, the Company has renamed this segment Land Management and Other Operations to better reflect the components of this segment. The Company did not generate any revenue from the dispersed water storage project and incurred expenses of $1,346,000, $1,206,000 and $1,619,000 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIn January 2018, the Company sold its breeding herd and leased grazing rights on the Ranch to a third-party operator. The Company continues to own the property and conduct its long-term dispersed water program and wildlife management programs. As part of the sales transaction, the Company expensed all cattle inventory costs that were accumulated at the date of sale.\nRevenues from Land Management and Other Operations were approximately 3.4%, 2.6%, and 3.9% of total operating revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOur Strategy\nOur core business strategy is to maximize stockholder value through continuously improving the return on our invested capital, either by holding and managing our existing land through skilled agricultural production, leasing, or other opportunistic means of monetization, disposing of under productive land or business units and acquiring new land or operations with appreciation potential.\nOur objectives are to produce the highest quality agricultural products, create innovative land uses, opportunistically acquire and convert undervalued assets, sell under-productive land and other assets not meeting our total return profile, generate recurring and sustainable profit with the appropriate balance of risk and reward, and exceed the expectations of shareholders, customers, clients and partners.\nOur strategy is based on best management practices of our agricultural operations and the environmental and conservation stewardship of our land and natural resources. We try to manage our land in a sustainable manner and evaluate the effect of changing land uses while considering new opportunities. Our commitment to environmental stewardship is fundamental to the Company\u2019s core beliefs.\nIntellectual Property\nWhile we consider our various intellectual property to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single piece of intellectual property or group of related intellectual property registrations or rights.\nSeasonal Nature of Business\nAs with any agribusiness enterprise, our agribusiness operations and revenues are predominantly seasonal in nature. The following table illustrates the seasonality of our agribusiness revenues:\nSignificant Customers\nRevenue from Tropicana represented approximately 87%, 89%, and 87% of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The revenue in fiscal year 2020 from Tropicana was generated primarily from two separate contracts. This revenue was generated from the sale of our citrus product in the processed market. No other single customer provided more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal years 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nCompetition\nThe orange and specialty citrus markets are intensely competitive, but no single producer has any significant market power over any market segments, as is consistent with the production of most agricultural commodities. Citrus is grown domestically in several states including Florida, California, Arizona and Texas, as well as foreign countries, most notably Brazil and Mexico. Competition is impacted by several factors including quality, production, demand, brand recognition, market prices, weather, disease, export/import restrictions and foreign currency exchange rates.\nGovernmental Regulations\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. Management believes we are in material compliance with all such rules including permitting and reporting requirements. Historically, compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nManagement monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every reasonable effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. In addition, we require in our leases that lessees of our property comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing.\nWe are subject to other laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies within the United States, which may differ among jurisdictions. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulation has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods.\nHuman Capital\nSupporting our people is a fundamental value for Alico. We believe the Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees and the employees of our independent contractors, particularly our key employees, significantly benefit our operations and performance. The Company's management oversees various employee initiatives and also monitors the effectiveness of the personnel provided by independent contractors with which we contract for certain harvesting and hauling services.\nHealth and safety in the workplace for our employees and personnel provided by independent contractors with which we contract is one of the Company\u2019s core values. Hazards in the workplace are actively identified and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees and the personnel provided by independent contractors safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, the Company has taken actions aligned with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect its workforce so that its workforce can more safely and effectively perform their work.\nEmployee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and takes into account the services that are performed for us by our independent contractors. We rely on our independent contractors to manage their respective employee levels so that the harvesting and hauling services they are obligated to perform for us are consistent with the contractual obligations of these independent contractors and enable us to satisfy our harvesting and hauling needs. Management believes that through its own employees, coupled with the human capital supplied by its independent contractors, it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. Management believes that the Company's employee relations are favorable, that its relations with its independent contractors is favorable and that the relations that the independent contractors and the Company has with the employees of the independent contractors is favorable.\nWe believe in a culture of equity, diversity and inclusion. We are also committed to advancing safe and respectful work environments where our employees are invited to bring their talents, backgrounds and expertise to bear on the success of our business and where every person has the opportunity to thrive personally and professionally.\nAs of September 30, 2020, we had 251 full-time employees. Our employees work in the following divisions:\n(1)\nThere is one employee who is included in Corporate, General, Administrative and Other who oversees the Land Management and Other operations.\nNone of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.\nCapital Resources and Raw Materials\nManagement believes that the Company will be able to meet its working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, and over the long term, through internally generated funds, cash flows from operations, the sale of under-productive land and other assets, our existing lines of credit and access to capital markets. The Company has commitments that provide for lines of revolving credit that are available for our general and corporate use.\nRaw materials needed to cultivate the various crops grown by the Company consist primarily of fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides and fuel and are readily available from local suppliers.\nAvailable Information\nWe will provide electronic copies of our SEC filings free of charge upon request. Additionally, our reports, amendments thereto, proxy statements and other information are also made available, free of charge, on our investor relations website at ir.alicoinc.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such information with the SEC. Any information posted on or linked from our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The SEC also maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov, which contains annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.",
    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of key known factors that we believe may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. They should be considered carefully, in addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, including the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in making any investment decisions with respect to our securities. Additional risks or uncertainties that are not currently known to us that we currently deem to be immaterial or that could apply to any company could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic instability and uncertainty and may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused economic instability and uncertainty globally and may have a material adverse impact, on our business.\nPotential negative impacts of the pandemic include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nReduction in customer demand for citrus products and decreased consumer spending levels, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations;\n\u2022\nPotential disruption of services on which we rely to deliver our harvested citrus to producers and fulfilling deliveries to production plants, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation;\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to obtain financing in the current economic environment on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us, or at all, which could impair our cash flows and restrict our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives and react to changes in our business or the environment;\n\u2022\nThere could be increased volatility in our stock price related to the pandemic, which could result in the loss of some or all of the value of an investment in the Company;\n\u2022\nOur ability to maintain our workforce during these uncertain times, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations;\n\u2022\nIncrease in employee absenteeism due to fear of infection, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations;\n\u2022\nIncrease in possible lawsuits or regulatory actions due to COVID-19 spread in the workplace which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations;\n\u2022\nSpread of COVID-19 in our workplace, which could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation;\n\u2022\nIncrease in the possibility of cybersecurity-related events such as COVID-19 themed phishing attacks and other security challenges, particularly as attributable to a substantial number of our employees and suppliers working remotely, which could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation; and\n\u2022\nAdverse impact on the productivity of management and our employees that are working remotely, including an impact on our ability to maintain our financial reporting processes and related controls and our ability to manage complex accounting issues presented by the COVID-19 pandemic which could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation.\nOur business operations could be significantly harmed by natural disasters or global epidemics.\nOur business could be adversely affected by natural disasters such as epidemics, outbreaks or other health crisis. An outbreak of avian flu or H1N1 flu in the human population, or another similar health crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic referred to above, could adversely affect economies and financial markets, particularly those in the United States. Moreover, any related disruptions to transportation or the free movement of persons could hamper our operations and force us to close our offices temporarily.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing or other natural or man-made disasters could cause damage or disruption to us, our employees, operations, markets and customers, which could result in significant delays in deliveries or substantial shortages of our products and adversely affect our business results of operations, financial condition or prospects.\nAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other natural conditions, including the effects of climate change, could impose significant costs and losses on our business.\nFresh produce is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including windstorms, floods, drought and temperature extremes, which are quite common and may occur with higher frequency or be less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change. Unfavorable growing conditions can reduce both crop size and crop quality. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. Citrus groves are subject to damage from frost and freezes, and this has happened periodically in the recent past, including most recently the impact from Hurricane Irma. In some cases, the fruit is damaged or ruined; in the case of extended periods of cold, the trees can also be damaged or killed. These factors can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from disease including but not limited to citrus greening and citrus canker which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from diseases such as citrus greening and citrus canker. Each of these diseases is widespread in Florida and exists in our citrus groves and in the areas where our citrus groves are located. The success of our citrus business is directly related to the viability and health of our citrus groves.\nCitrus greening is one of the most serious citrus plant diseases in the world. Once a tree is infected, its productivity generally decreases. While the disease poses no threat to humans or animals, it has devastated citrus crops throughout the United States and abroad. Named for its green, misshapen fruit, citrus greening disease has now killed millions of citrus plants in the southeastern United States and has spread across the entire country. Infected trees produce fruits that are green, misshapen and bitter, unsuitable for sale as fresh fruit or for juice. Infected trees can die within a few years. At the present time, there is no known cure for citrus greening once trees have become infected. Primarily, as a result of citrus greening, orange production in the State of Florida has continued to drop.\nCitrus canker is a disease affecting citrus species and is caused by a bacterium which is spread by contact with infected trees or by windblown transmission. There is no known cure for citrus canker at present although some management practices, including the use of copper-based bactericides, can mitigate its spread and lessen its effect on infected trees; however, there is no assurance that currently available technologies will control such disease effectively.\nBoth of these diseases pose a significant threat to the Florida citrus industry and to our citrus groves. While we try to use best management practices to attempt to control diseases and their spread, there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful. These diseases can significantly increase our costs which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our citrus groves produce the significant majority of our annual operating revenues. A significant reduction in available citrus from our citrus groves could decrease our operating revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur citrus groves are geographically concentrated in Florida and the effects of adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur citrus operations are concentrated in central and south Florida with our groves located in parcels in DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, and Hardee Counties. Because our groves are located in close proximity to each other, the impact of adverse weather conditions may be material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Florida is particularly susceptible to the occurrence of hurricanes and tropical storms. Depending on where any particular hurricane or tropical storm makes landfall, our properties could experience significant, if not catastrophic damage. Hurricanes and tropical storms have the potential to destroy crops and impact citrus production through the loss of fruit and destruction of trees and/or plants either as a result of high winds or through the spread of windblown disease. Such damage could materially affect our citrus operations and could result in a loss of operating revenues from those products for a multi-year period. We seek to minimize hurricane risk by the purchase of insurance contracts, but the majority of our crops remain uninsured. In addition to hurricanes and tropical storms, the occurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Florida, such as tornadoes, floods, freezes, unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts and heat waves, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to realize income from our crops or properties.\nA significant portion of our revenues are derived from our citrus business and any adverse event affecting such business could disproportionately harm our business.\nOur revenues from our citrus business were approximately 96.6%, 97.4%, and 96.1% of our operating revenues in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our citrus division is one of the largest citrus producers in the United States and because of the significance of the revenues derived from this business, we are more vulnerable to adverse events or market conditions affecting our citrus business which could have a significant impact on our overall results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur failure to effectively perform grove management functions or to effectively manage an expanded portfolio of groves could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRecently, we have significantly expanded the number of grove acres that we are managing for third parties. If we are unable to effectively perform grove management services for both our own groves and the groves owned by third parties at the level and/or the cost that we expect, or if we were to fail to allocate sufficient resources to meet the grove management of our own groves and the groves owned by these third parties, it could adversely affect our performance and reputation. Our ability to perform the grove management services will be affected by various factors, including, among other things, our ability to maintain sufficient personnel and retain key personnel and the number of acres and groves that we will manage. Increases in the number of acres and groves we are managing have required us to hire a greater number of additional qualified personnel. No assurance can be made that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or in integrating any new personnel into our organization.\nOur business is highly competitive and we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current market share.\nMany companies compete in our different businesses and offer products that are similar to our products or are direct competitors to our products. We face strong competition from these and other companies engaged in the agricultural product business.\nImportant factors with respect to our competitors include the following:\n\u2022\nSome of our competitors may have greater operating flexibility and, in certain cases, this may permit them\n\u2022\nto respond better or more quickly to changes in the industry.\n\u2022\nWe cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of our competitors or whether those actions will have a negative effect on us.\n\u2022\nOur competitors may have access to substantially greater financial resources, deeper management and agricultural resources, regional, national or global areas that offer agricultural advantages, and enhanced public visibility or reputations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our present and future competitors, and our ability to compete could be materially adversely affected by our debt levels and debt service requirements.\nWe depend on our relationship with Tropicana for a significant portion of our business. Any disruption in this relationship could harm our sales. Additionally, if certain criteria are not met under one of our contracts with Tropicana, we could experience a significant reduction in revenues and cash flows.\nThe Company's contracts with Tropicana accounted for 86.9%, 88.6%, and 86.6% of the Company's revenues in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The revenue for Tropicana is primarily generated from two contracts. Should there be any change in our current relationship structure, whereby they do not buy our oranges, we would need to find replacement buyers to purchase our remaining crop, which could take time and expense and may result in less favorable terms of sale. The loss of Tropicana as a customer or significant reduction in business with Tropicana may cause a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur agricultural products are subject to supply and demand pricing which is not predictable.\nAgricultural operations traditionally provide almost all of our operating revenues with citrus being the largest portion and are subject to supply and demand pricing. Prior to this current fiscal year, according to Nielsen data, consumer demand for orange juice had decreased significantly to its lowest level in almost a decade; however, we have been able to offset the impact of such decline with higher prices based on a lower supply of available oranges. Although the demand for orange juice has increased in this latest year, it is uncertain as to whether such increased demand can be maintained, whether we will see a return to a decline in the future and whether, if there were to be such a decline, the impact could be again offset by higher prices. In particular, although our processed citrus is subject to minimum pricing, we are unable to predict with certainty the final price we will receive for our products. In some instances, the harvest and growth cycle will dictate when such products must be marketed which\nmay or may not be advantageous in obtaining the best price. Excessive supplies tend to cause severe price competition and lower prices for the commodity affected. Limited supply of certain agricultural commodities due to world and domestic market conditions can cause commodity prices to rise in certain situations.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and execute our strategic growth initiatives, or if they do not adequately address the challenges or opportunities we face, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent, in part, on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategic growth initiatives that will enable us to achieve sustainable growth in the long term. The implementation of our strategic initiatives is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally and the inherent risks associated with implementing new strategies. These strategic initiatives may not be successful in generating revenues or improving operating profit and, if they are, it may take longer than anticipated. As a result, and depending on evolving conditions and opportunities, we may need to adjust our strategic initiatives and such changes could be substantial, including modifying or terminating one or more of such initiatives. Termination of such initiatives may require us to write down or write off the value of our investments in them. Transition and changes in our strategic initiatives may also create uncertainty in our employees, customers and partners that could adversely affect our business and revenues. In addition, we may incur higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing our strategic initiatives, attempting to attract revenue opportunities or changing our strategies. There can be no assurance that the implementation of any strategic growth initiative will be successful, and we may not realize anticipated benefits at levels we project or at all, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims.\nThe sale of agricultural products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling or transportation phases. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that our agricultural products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered or fully covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. We maintain product liability insurance; however, we cannot be sure that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage.\nOur agricultural operations are subject to water use regulations restricting our access to water.\nOur operations are dependent upon the availability of adequate surface and underground water. The availability of water is regulated by the state of Florida through water management districts which have jurisdiction over various geographic regions in which our lands are located. Currently, we have permits in place for the next 15 to 20 years for the use of underground and surface water which are believed to be adequate for our agricultural needs.\nSurface water in Hendry County, where much of our agricultural land is located, comes from Lake Okeechobee via the Caloosahatchee River and a system of canals used to irrigate such land. The Army Corps of Engineers controls the level of Lake Okeechobee and ultimately determines the availability of surface water even though the use of water has been permitted by the state of Florida through the water management district. The Army Corps of Engineers decided in 2010 to lower the permissible level of Lake Okeechobee in response to concerns about the ability of the levee surrounding the lake to restrain rising waters which could result from hurricanes. Changes in availability of surface water use may result during times of drought, because of lower lake levels and could materially adversely affect our agricultural operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in immigration laws could impact our ability to harvest our crops.\nWe engage third parties to provide personnel for our harvesting operations. The availability and number of such workers is subject to decrease if there are changes in the U.S. immigration laws. Immigration reform and enforcement has been attracting significant attention from the U.S. Government (particularly in the current U.S. administration and U.S. Congress), with enforcement operations taking place across the country, resulting in arrests and detentions of unauthorized workers. It remains unclear how the next U.S. administration will approach immigration reform and enforcement. However, if new immigration legislation is enacted in the U.S. and/or if enforcement actions are taken against available personnel, such legislation and/or enforcement activities may contain provisions that could significantly reduce the number and availability of workers. Termination of a significant number of personnel who might be found to be unauthorized workers or the scarcity of other available personnel to harvest our agricultural products could cause harvesting costs to increase or could lead to the loss of product that is not timely harvested which could have a material adverse effect to our citrus grove business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur acquisition of additional agricultural assets and other businesses could pose risks.\nWe seek to opportunistically acquire new agricultural assets from time to time that we believe would complement our business. For example, (i) in fiscal year 2015, we acquired three Florida citrus properties, including Orange-Co and Silver Nip Citrus, which resulted in our citrus division being one of the largest citrus producers in the United States, and (ii) in October 2020 we acquired another Florida citrus property. While we expect that our past and future acquisitions will successfully complement our business, we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, which could reduce our anticipated results. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, or obtain any financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions or complete proposed acquisitions. Acquisitions by us could result in accounting changes, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, increased debt and contingent liabilities, reduce the amount of cash available for dividends, debt service payments, integration issues and diversion of management\u2019s attention, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We may be unable to successfully realize the financial, operational, and other benefits we anticipate from our acquisitions and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDispositions of our assets may adversely affect our future results of operations.\nWe also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain of our assets which could include the exit from lines of business. For example, in November of 2014, we sold significant sugarcane assets and we are no longer involved in the sugarcane business and, in January of 2018, we sold our breeding herd and no longer engage in cattle operations. Most recently, we sold certain ranch acres to the State of Florida because these acres would have been critically important for carrying out the Company\u2019s planned dispersed water storage project, the Company is no longer are pursuing permit approval relating to this dispersed water storage project. While such dispositions increase the amount of cash available to us, it could also result in a potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams that we might not be able to replace, makes our business less diversified and could ultimately have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf a transaction intended to qualify as a Section 1031 Exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties in the future on a tax deferred basis.\nFrom time to time we dispose of properties in transactions that are intended to qualify as Section 1031 Exchanges under the federal income tax law. It is possible that the qualification of a transaction as a Section 1031 Exchange could be successfully challenged and determined to be currently taxable and we could also be required to pay interest and penalties. As a result, we may be required to borrow funds in order to pay additional income taxes, and the payment of such taxes could cause us to have less cash available. Moreover, it is possible that legislation could be enacted that could modify or repeal the laws with respect to Section 1031 Exchanges, which could make it more difficult or not possible for us to dispose of properties in the future on a tax deferred basis.\nWe may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations or result in unforeseeable risks to our business.\nWe continuously evaluate the acquisition or disposition of operating businesses and assets and may in the future undertake one or more significant transactions. Any such acquisitive transaction could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and the purchase of equity interests. The consideration for such acquisitive transactions may include, among other things, cash, common stock or equity interests in the Company or our subsidiaries, or a contribution of property or equipment to obtain equity interests, and in conjunction with a transaction we might incur additional indebtedness. We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain assets. Such dispositions could take the form of asset sales, mergers or sales of equity interests.\nThese transactions may present significant risks such as insufficient assets to offset liabilities assumed, potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams, increased or unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, the triggering of certain financial covenants in our debt instruments (including accelerated repayment) and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. In addition, such transactions could distract management from current operations. As a result of the risks inherent in such transactions, we cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of its anticipated benefits or that it will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we were to complete such an acquisition, disposition, investment or other strategic transaction, we may require additional debt or equity financing that could result in a significant increase in our amount of debt and our debt service obligations or the number of outstanding shares of our common stock, thereby diluting holders of our common stock outstanding prior to such acquisition.\nOur citrus business is seasonal.\nOur citrus groves produce the majority of our annual operating revenues and the citrus business is seasonal because it is tied to the growing and picking seasons. Historically, the second and third quarters of our fiscal year generally produce the majority of our annual revenues, and our working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year coinciding with our planting cycles. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year or in\nfuture quarters. If our operating revenues in the second and third quarters are lower than expected, it would have a disproportionately large adverse impact on our annual operating results.\nWe face significant competition in our agricultural operations.\nWe face significant competition in our agricultural operations both from domestic and foreign producers and do not have any branded products. Foreign growers generally have an equal or lower cost of production, less environmental regulation and in some instances, greater resources and market flexibility than us. Because foreign growers have greater flexibility as to when they enter the U.S. market, we cannot always predict the impact these competitors will have on our business and results of operations. The competition we face from certain foreign suppliers of orange juice is mitigated by a governmentally imposed tariff on orange imports. Accordingly, a reduction in the government\u2019s orange juice tariff could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur earnings are sensitive to fluctuations in market supply and prices and demand for our products.\nExcess supplies often cause severe price competition in our industry. Growing conditions in various parts of the world, particularly weather conditions such as windstorms, floods, droughts and freezes, as well as diseases and pests, are primary factors affecting market prices because of their influence on the supply and quality of product.\nFresh produce is highly perishable and generally must be brought to market and sold soon after harvest. Many of the items involved in our business, such as oranges, must be sold more quickly than other produce our competitors may produce, such as lemons. As such, our competitors may be able to maintain certain items they produce in inventory for longer periods than we are able to maintain our inventory which may offer our competitors strategic advantages when they respond to fluctuations in market supply and demand that are not available to us.\nIn addition, general public perceptions regarding the quality, safety or health risks associated with particular food products could reduce demand and prices for some of our products. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products that we produce for health or other reasons, and we are unable to modify our products or to develop products that satisfy new consumer preferences, there will be a decreased demand for our products. If excess supplies do exist, this could result in reduced pricing or unusable inventory which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on the productivity of our citrus groves, it could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operations. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.\nIncreases in labor, personnel and benefits costs could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe primarily utilize labor contractors to harvest and deliver our fruit to outside packing facilities. Our employees and contractors are in demand by other agribusinesses and other industries. Shortages of labor, particularly as a result of the recent low unemployment rate in the United States and in Florida in particular, could delay our harvesting or orange processing activities or could result in increases in labor costs.\nWe and our labor contractors are subject to government mandated wage and benefit laws and regulations. In addition, current or future federal or state healthcare legislation and regulation, including the Affordable Care Act, may increase our medical costs or the medical costs of our labor contractors that could be passed on to us.\nIncreases in commodity or raw product costs, such as fuel and chemical costs, could adversely affect our operating results.\nMany factors may affect the cost and supply of citrus, including external conditions, commodity market fluctuations, changes in governmental laws and regulations, tariffs, agricultural programs, severe and prolonged weather conditions and natural disasters. Increased costs for products can negatively impact our operating results and there can be no assurance that they will not adversely affect our operating results in the future.\nWe are subject to transportation risks.\nWe depend on third party providers of transportation and have no control over such third parties. An extended interruption in our ability to harvest and haul our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any extended disruption in the distribution of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we believe we are adequately insured and would attempt to transport our products by alternative means if we were to experience an interruption due to strike, natural disasters or otherwise, we cannot be sure that we would be able to do so or be successful in doing so in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nWe benefit from reduced real estate taxes due to the agricultural classification of a majority of our land. Changes in the classification or valuation methods employed by county property appraisers could cause significant changes in our real estate property tax liabilities.\nIn the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 we paid approximately $2,714,000, $2,755,000, and $3,089,000 in real estate taxes, respectively. These taxes were based upon the agricultural use (\u201cGreen Belt\u201d) values determined by the county property appraisers in which counties we own land, of approximately $87,976,000, $91,312,000, and $104,017,000 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which differs significantly from the fair values determined by the county property appraisers of approximately $463,799,000, $514,330,000, and $537,183,000, respectively. Changes in state law or county policy regarding the granting of agricultural classification or calculation of \"Green Belt\" values or average millage rates could significantly impact our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial position.\nLiability for the use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and other potentially hazardous substances could increase our costs.\nOur agricultural business involves the use of herbicides, fertilizers and pesticides, some of which may be considered hazardous or toxic substances. We may be deemed liable and have to pay for the costs or damages associated with the improper application, accidental release or the use or misuse of such substances. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages, or may not continue to be available at a price or under terms that are satisfactory to us. In such cases, if we are required to pay significant costs or damages, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCompliance with applicable environmental laws may substantially increase our costs of doing business which could reduce our profits.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the operation of our properties, which are administered by numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies. We face a potential for environmental liability by virtue of our ownership of real estate property. If hazardous substances (including herbicides and pesticides used by us or by any persons leasing our lands) are discovered emanating from any of our lands and the release of such substances presents a threat of harm to the public health or the environment, we may be held strictly liable for the cost of remediation of these hazardous substances. In addition, environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site\u2019s location, its present and former uses, and other factors such as the presence of wetlands or endangered species on the site. Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. Furthermore, we require lessees of our properties to comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing. We also purchase insurance for environmental liability when it is available; however, these insurance contracts may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages or may not continue to be available at prices and terms that would be satisfactory. It is possible that in some cases the cost of compliance with these environmental laws could exceed the value of a particular tract of land, make it unsuitable for use in what would otherwise be its highest and best use, and/or be significant enough that it would materially adversely affect us.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we lose key employees.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel. These individuals have extensive experience and expertise in the business lines and segments in which they work. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and retain skilled personnel in our business lines and segments.\nInflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations.\nInflation can have a major impact on our citrus operations. The citrus operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues and very high irrigation water costs. High fixed water costs related to our citrus lands will continue to adversely affect earnings. Prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices. Therefore, it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue, just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation, except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded company.\nAs a company with publicly traded securities, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as well as rules promulgated by the SEC and Nasdaq, requires us to adopt corporate governance practices applicable to U.S. public companies. These laws, rules and regulations may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenues, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.\nComputer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems and databases or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our systems and databases. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we develop internally or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, distribution or other critical functions.\nPortions of our information technology infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to track sales and could interrupt other operational or financial processes, which in turn could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe maintain a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and may limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business.\nAs of September 30, 2020, we had approximately $151,000,000 in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our secured credit facilities and line of credit and an additional availability of approximately $91,659,000 is available under our revolving lines of credit. Our loan agreements, as well as other debt instruments we may enter into in the future, may have negative consequences to us and could limit our business because we will use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs which will reduce the funds available to us for corporate and general expenses and it may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. Our loan agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan agreements and would result in a cross-default under other loan agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under loan agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our loan agreements also contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. We expect that we will depend primarily upon our citrus operations to provide funds to pay our corporate and general expenses and to pay any amounts that may become due under any credit facilities and any other indebtedness we may incur. In addition, there are factors beyond our control that could negatively affect our citrus business revenue stream. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by various financial, business, macroeconomic and other factors, many of which we cannot control.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations.\nTo service our debt, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash, make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance, cash flow and capital resources depend upon prevailing economic conditions and various financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include among others:\n\u2022\neconomic and competitive conditions\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations\n\u2022\noperating difficulties, increased operating costs or pricing pressures we may experience; and\n\u2022\ndelays in implementing any strategic projects\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. If we are required to take any actions referred to above, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure investors that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.\nSome of our debt is based on variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of an increase in the interest rates.\nOur credit facility and certain of our term loans that we have currently bear interest at variable rates, which will generally change as interest rates change. We bear the risk that the rates we are charged by our lenders will increase faster than the earnings and cash flow of our business, which could reduce profitability, adversely affect our ability to service our debt, cause us to breach covenants contained in our credit facility and term loans, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur common stock has low trading volume and the distribution of all of the shares of our common stock owned by 734 Investors to its members has the effect of increasing the Company\u2019s public float and such increase may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nAlthough our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, it is thinly traded and our average daily trading volume is low compared to the number of shares of common stock we have outstanding. The low trading volume of our common stock can cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly as well as make it difficult for a shareholder to sell their common shares quickly. As a result of our stock being thinly traded and/or our low stock price, institutional investors might not be interested in owning our common stock, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain future funding, if needed, as well as create a potential market overhang.\nOn November 12, 2019, 734 Investors effected a distribution of all of the shares of our common stock owned by 734 Investors to its members. The distribution of Alico shares of common stock by 734 Investors to its members has the effect of increasing the Company\u2019s public float and such increase, although it may increase the trading volume and thus reduce some of the trading volume risk described above, may at the same time over the short term have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock if too many members of 734 Investors seek to liquidate their shares over a short period.\nWe may not be able to continue to pay or maintain our cash dividends on our common stock and the failure to do so may negatively affect our share price.\nWe have historically paid regular quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our ability to pay cash dividends depends on, among other things, our cash flows from operations, our cash requirements, our financial condition, the degree to which we are/or become leveraged, contractual restrictions binding on us, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash from continuing operations in the future, or have sufficient cash surplus or net profits to pay dividends on our common stock. Our dividend policy is based upon our directors\u2019 current assessment of our business and the environment in which we operate and that assessment could change based on business developments (which could, for example, increase our need for capital expenditures) or new growth opportunities. Our Board of Directors may, in its discretion, decrease the level of cash dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of cash dividends. The reduction or elimination of cash dividends may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that we will resume the repurchase of shares of our common stock.\nIn fiscal year 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7,000,000 of the Company\u2019s common stock in two separate authorizations. In March 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5,000,000 of the Company\u2019s common stock beginning March 9, 2017 and continued through March 9, 2019. In May 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2,000,000 of the Company\u2019s common stock beginning May 24, 2017 and continued through May 24, 2019. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares in the future in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in, or elimination of, share repurchases could have a negative effect on our share price.\nIf we were to conduct another tender offer or engage in an additional share repurchase program, holders of our securities would be subject to certain risks associated with a decrease in the outstanding number of shares of our common stock.\nIn September 2018 the Company announced the commencement of the Tender Offer. During the Tender Offer the Company repurchased an aggregate of 752,234 shares at a price of $34.00 per share aggregating $25,575,956. These shares represented approximately 9.2% of the total number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock issued and outstanding as of October 2, 2018. While we have no plans to conduct another tender offer at this time, we may conduct another tender offer or engage in the repurchase of our shares in the future. Shareholders could be adversely affected by a reduction in our \u201cpublic float,\u201d that is, the number of shares owned by outside shareholders and available for trading in the securities markets, if the Company makes future tender offers or private or open market repurchases of its shares. Although the Company is not currently pursuing a tender offer or repurchase program, there are no assurances that our Board of Directors will not authorize the Company to do so in the future. Engaging in a tender offer or repurchase program in the future could have a negative effect on our share price.",

Trafelet (the \u201cTrafelet Parties\u201d), who was at the time the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, filed a lawsuit against Messrs. George R. Brokaw, Henry R. Slack, W. Andrew Krusen and Greg Eisner, members of the Board of Directors, in the Circuit Court (the \u201cCircuit Court\u201d) for Hillsborough County, Florida (the \u201cFlorida Litigation\u201d). The Trafelet Parties sought, among other things, a declaration that (1) a purported stockholder action by written consent, delivered to the Company in the name of 734 Investors and the plaintiffs in the Florida Litigation on November 11, 2018 (the \u201cPurported Consent\u201d) was valid and binding, (2) the resolutions passed at a meeting of the Board of Directors on November 12, 2018, to, among other things, constitute an ad hoc committee of the Board of Directors to consider, evaluate and make any and all determinations, and to take any and all actions, on behalf of the Board of Directors, in connection with the Purported Consent were null and void and (3) the four defendants in the Florida Litigation were properly removed from the Board of Directors by the Purported Consent. On November 27, 2018, the Circuit Court denied without prejudice plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order and an affirmative injunction restoring Mr. Trafelet from administrative leave to active status in his capacity as President and CEO of the Company.\nOn November 28, 2018, the parties in the Florida Litigation stipulated to an order which provided that (1) the record date for the Purported Consent was stayed indefinitely, and (2) Mr. Trafelet and the Company\u2019s Board of Directors should not take any action out of routine day-to-day operations conducted in the ordinary course of business, including any action to change the corporate governance of Alico or removing any corporate officers or directors from positions held as of November 27, 2018.\nOn December 6, 2018, the Trafelet Parties filed an amended complaint in the Florida Litigation which added the Company and Benjamin D. Fishman, a member of the Board of Directors, as defendants. On December 21, 2018, the Trafelet Parties filed a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction restoring Mr. Trafelet from administrative leave to active status in his capacity as President and CEO of the Company. On January 14, 2019, the defendants in the Florida Litigation filed an opposition to plaintiffs\u2019 renewed motion for a preliminary injunction. On January 18, 2019, the defendants in the Florida Litigation filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint.\nOn February 11, 2019, the parties to the Florida Litigation entered into a settlement agreement (the \u201cAlico Settlement Agreement\u201d) wherein the parties agreed to promptly dismiss all claims in the Florida Litigation. Pursuant to the Alico Settlement Agreement, Mr. Trafelet agreed to voluntarily resign as President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Board of Directors, effective upon the execution of the Alico Settlement Agreement.\nAs contemplated by the Alico Settlement Agreement, on February 11, 2019, the Company entered into a consulting agreement (the \u201cConsulting Agreement\u201d) with Mr. Trafelet and 3584 Inc., an entity controlled by Mr. Trafelet (the \u201cConsultant\u201d). Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, Mr. Trafelet agreed to make himself available to provide consulting services to the Company through the Consultant for up to 24 months. In exchange for the consulting services, the Consultant is receiving an annual consulting fee of $400,000. If the Company terminates the consulting period (other than in certain specified circumstances), the Company will continue to pay the consulting fees described in the immediately preceding sentence through the balance of the 24-month term. As such, the Company recorded the $800,000 as expense in the quarter ended March 31, 2019.\nIn addition, on February 11, 2019, as contemplated by the Alico Settlement Agreement, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the \u201cRegistration Rights Agreement\u201d) with Mr. Trafelet, relating to the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock directly held by the Trafelet Parties as of February 11, 2019 (the \u201cRegistrable Securities\u201d). The Registration Rights Agreement required the Company to, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, use reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of the Registrable Securities. On October 10, 2019, Mr. Trafelet executed a waiver whereby he waived the S-3 Registration Rights but maintained all other rights arising under the Registration Rights Agreement and all rights arising under Section 14 of the Alico Settlement Agreement.\nFrom time to time, Alico may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. There are no other current legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or of which any of its property is subject that it believes will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.",

(\u201cAlico\u201d), together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cCompany\", \"we\", \"us\" or \"our\u201d), is a holding company with assets and related operations in agriculture, land management and natural resources. We are a Florida agribusiness and land management company with a legacy of achievement and innovation in citrus, cattle and resource conservation. We own approximately 100,000 acres of land in eight Florida counties, holding mineral rights on approximately 90,000 of those owned acres. Our principal lines of business are now citrus groves and land management and other operations, which include land conservation, encompassing environmental services, land leasing and related support operations. Prior to the sale of certain ranch land to the State of Florida in September 2020, the Company\u2019s business line also included Water Resources. Prior to the sale of our breeding herd in January 2018, the Company\u2019s business line also included cattle ranching. Our mission is to create value for our customers and shareholders by managing existing lands to their optimal current income and total returns. Alico opportunistically acquires new agricultural assets and produces high quality agricultural products while exercising responsible environmental stewardship. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) is intended to help provide an understanding of results of operations, financial condition and changes in financial condition for the periods presented. This MD&A is organized as follows:\n\u2022\nBusiness Overview. This section provides a general description of our business, as well as other matters that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nConsolidated Results of Operations. This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for each of the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2020. Our discussion is presented on a consolidated basis and includes discussion on future trends by segment.\n\u2022\nLiquidity and Capital Resources. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows for each of the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and our outstanding debt, commitments and cash resources as of September 30, 2020.\n\u2022\nCritical Accounting Policies. This section identifies those accounting policies that we consider important to our results of operations and financial condition, require significant judgment and involve significant management estimates. Our significant accounting policies, including those considered to be critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 2, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBusiness Overview\nBusiness Description\nAlico, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, \u201cAlico\u201d, the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) generates operating revenues primarily from the sale of its citrus products and grazing and hunting leasing. The Company operates as two business segments and all of its operating revenues are generated in the United States. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, the Company generated operating revenues of approximately $92,507,000, income from operations of approximately $6,921,000, and net income attributable to common stockholders of approximately $23,662,000. Cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1,049,000 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.\nFiscal Year Highlights and Other Developments\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the current novel coronavirus outbreak (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) to be a global pandemic. In response to this declaration and the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the United States, federal, state and local governments throughout the country have imposed varying degrees of restrictions on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the illness. These measures have had a significant adverse impact upon many sectors of the economy, including certain agriculture businesses.\nDuring March 2020, as a precautionary measure to ensure financial flexibility and maintain maximum liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company implemented several measures that we believe would help ensure sufficient liquidity for the next several months, including drawing down an aggregate of $70,000,000 on its revolving credit facilities. This decision was made to safeguard the Company\u2019s liquidity and to increase available cash on hand in the event that a more protracted COVID-19 outbreak were to put a significant strain on the financial institutions and their ability to loan funds. As of September 30, 2020, the Company, believing that despite the protracted COVID-19 outbreak, the financial institutions industry was experiencing less negative impact from the outbreak than originally expected, proceeded to pay down the majority of the amounts drawn under its revolving credit facilities.\nAdditionally, for the protection of our employees per the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, the Company arranged to have the majority of office personnel work remotely, has taken steps to allow and encourage greater separation for our employed and contracted field workers and has worked with its harvesters, haulers and suppliers to minimize interactions. The Company continues to assess the situation on a routine basis.\nTo date, the Company has experienced no material adverse impacts from this pandemic.\nCitrus Grove Management Agreement\nOn July 16, 2020, the Company executed an agreement with an affiliated group of third parties to provide citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services for approximately 7,000 acres owned by such third parties. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company is to be reimbursed by the third parties for all of its costs incurred related to providing these services and also is to receive a management fee based on acres covered under this agreement.\nAgreements with Tropicana\nOn each of May 18, 2020 and May 20, 2020, the Company entered into a new agreement to supply Tropicana, its largest customer, with citrus fruit. These new agreements are effective October 1, 2020, conclude on July 31, 2024, and succeed an existing agreement that expired at the end of September 2020.\nFederal Relief Program\nThe Company is eligible for Hurricane Irma federal relief programs for block grants that are being administered through the State of Florida. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company received approximately $4,629,000 and $15,597,000, respectively, under the Florida Citrus Recovery Block Grant (\u201cCRBG\u201d) program. This represents the Part 1 and Part 2 reimbursement under a three-part program. The timing and amount to be received under Part 3 of the program, if any, has not been finalized.\nDistribution of Shares by 734 Investors\nOn November 14, 2019, 734 Investors filed a Form 4 and an amendment to Schedule 13D with the SEC disclosing that on November 12, 2019, it distributed all of its shares of Company common stock previously held by it, consisting of 3,173,405 shares, on a pro rata basis, to its members. Prior to such distribution, 734 Investors was the Company\u2019s largest shareholder.\nEmployee and Board of Directors Matters\nOn August 6, 2020, the Board of Directors increased the number of its directors by two and appointed Mr. Adam Putnam and Ms. Kate English as directors, each to serve until the 2021 annual meeting of the Company\u2019s shareholders or until his or her earlier death, resignation, or removal in accordance with the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company.\nIn December 2019, Mr. George R. Brokaw, the then Executive Vice Chairman, informed the Board of Directors that he would voluntarily step down as Executive Vice Chairman effective December 31, 2019 and that change has taken effect. After the effectiveness of this change, Mr. Brokaw has remained a member of the Board of Directors.\nEffective February 27, 2020 (which was immediately after the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders), by way of action that has been taken by and at the direction of the Board of Directors, Benjamin D. Fishman, the non-employee Executive Chairman, became the Chairman of the Board. Mr. Fishman has remained a non-employee director.\nCondensed Consolidated Results of Operations\nThe following discussion provides an analysis of Alico's results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nNM - Not meaningful\nThe following table presents our operating revenues, by segment, as a percentage of total operating revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nThe following discussion provides an analysis of the Company's operating segments:\nAlico Citrus\nNM - Not meaningful\nOur citrus groves produce the majority of our annual operating revenues and the citrus grove business is seasonal because it is tied to the growing and harvest season. Historically, the second and third quarters of Alico's fiscal year produce the majority of the annual revenues and working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year, coinciding with the growing cycles.\nThe Company sells its Early and Mid-Season and Valencia oranges to processors that convert the majority of the citrus crop into orange juice. They generally buy the citrus on a pound solids basis, which is the measure of the soluble solids (sugars and acids) contained in one box of fruit. Fresh fruit is generally sold to packing houses that purchase the citrus on a per box basis. Other revenues consist of third-party grove caretaking and the purchase and reselling of fruit.\nAlico's operating expenses consist primarily of cost of sales and harvesting and hauling costs. Cost of sales represents the cost of maintaining the citrus groves for the preceding calendar year and does not vary in relation to production. Harvesting and hauling costs represent the costs of bringing citrus product to processors and varies based upon the number of boxes produced. Other expenses include the period costs of third-party grove caretaking and the purchase and reselling of fruit.\nThe decrease in revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 was due to a decrease in the price per pound solids as well as a decrease in aggregate processed box production. The decrease in the price per pound solids in the market place was a result of excess supply from domestic and international growers. The decrease in aggregate processed box production was the result of greater fruit drop and smaller fruit size of Valencias in the current harvest season as compared to the prior harvest season, offset in part by an increase in processed box production of the Early and Mid-season fruit.\nAs previously disclosed, the Company anticipated a reduction in the market prices throughout the 2019-20 harvest season as a result of the excess supply from domestic and international growers. However, due to an increase in the consumption of Not from Concentrate Orange Juice (\"NFC\"), as indicated in the published Nielsen data, since March 2020, inventory levels have decreased and, as a result, the Company anticipates that market pricing will improve in the 2020-21 harvest season.\nThe Company completed its harvest season in the middle of May 2020 and was able to complete the harvest without any negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe increase in revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, was primarily related to the negative impact of Hurricane Irma on the prior fiscal year harvest. As a result of Hurricane Irma, which occurred in September 2017, the Company experienced a greater amount of fruit drop and consequently harvested approximately 3,202,000 fewer boxes in fiscal year 2018, as compared to fiscal year 2019. The Company also saw an overall increase in pound solids per box in fiscal year 2019, which was 5.91 as compared to 5.64 for fiscal year 2018. In addition, the increase in revenue, to a smaller extent, was due to a greater number of boxes of fresh fruit being sold in fiscal year 2019.\nTotal processed boxes harvested in fiscal year 2020 decreased by approximately 7.5%, as compared to fiscal year 2019. Pound solids increased by approximately 6.4% and decreased by approximately 14.1% for the Early and Mid-Season and Valencia oranges, respectively. The combination of these items resulted in approximately 3,149,000 fewer pound solids sold in fiscal year 2020, as compared to fiscal year 2019.\nTotal processed boxes harvested in fiscal year 2019 increased by approximately 68.1%, as compared to fiscal year 2018. Pound solids increased by approximately 6.9% and approximately 4.0% for the Early and Mid-Season and Valencia oranges, respectively. The combination of these items resulted in approximately 20,214,000 of additional pound solids sold in fiscal year 2019, as compared to fiscal year 2018.\nThe USDA, in its November 10, 2020 Citrus Crop Forecast for the 2020-21 harvest season, indicated its expectation that the Florida orange crop will decrease from approximately 67,300,000 boxes for the 2019-20 crop year to approximately 57,000,000 boxes for the 2020-21 crop year, a decrease of approximately 15.3%. As production is estimated to be lower than in the prior year, the Company anticipates there will be an increase in market prices in the 2020-21 harvest season primarily driven by an increase in demand for NFC orange juice, which will more than offset the negative impact from the estimated decline in production.\nThe increase in operating expenses for the fiscal year 2020, as compared to the fiscal year 2019, primarily relates to the Company receiving less federal relief proceeds through the Florida CRBG program relating to Hurricane Irma, which are recorded as a reduction of operating expenses, during fiscal year 2020, as compared to fiscal year 2019. The Company received proceeds of approximately $4,629,000 and $15,597,000 through the Florida CRBG program relating to Hurricane Irma during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, the Company recorded additional grove management services expense of approximately $3.0 million. Partially offsetting this decrease in operating expenses was a reduction in harvesting and hauling costs experienced by the Company as a result of fewer processed boxes being harvested during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in the prior year.\nOn July 16, 2020, the Company executed an agreement with an affiliated group of third parties to provide citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services for approximately 7,000 acres owned by such third parties. Under the terms of this agreement, the Company is to be reimbursed by the third parties for all of its costs incurred related to providing these services and also is to receive a management fee based on acres covered under this agreement. As the Company provides these citrus grove caretaking management services, the Company will be recording both an increase in revenues and expenses. For the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2020, the Company recorded approximately $3,300,000 of operating revenue, including the management fee, and approximately $3,000,000 of operating expenses relating to this arrangement.\nLand Management and Other Operations\nThe table below presents key operating measures for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nNM - Not meaningful\nLand and other leasing include lease income from leases for grazing rights, hunting leases, a farm lease, a lease to a third party of an aggregate mine, leases of oil extraction rights to third parties, and other miscellaneous income.\nThe slight decrease in revenues from Land Management and Other Operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 is primarily due to a reduction in the leased acreage relating to a cattle grazing lease. The reduction in the leased acreage was due to certain acres, which were included under this lease arrangement, having been sold in September 2019.\nOn September 11, 2020, the Company sold approximately 10,700 acres on the western part of Alico Ranch to the State of Florida. Because the acres involved in the sale would have been critical to our planned dispersed water storage project, the Company has decided to no longer pursue permit approval activities for this particular project. As a result of this decision, the Company wrote-down approximately $598,000 of assets relating to this project during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. The Company anticipates that it will have no further expenses incurred relating to the dispersed water storage project moving forward.\nThe slight increase in revenues from Land Management and Other Operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 is primarily due to the Company recording a full year of grazing lease revenue in fiscal year 2019, while only recording nine months of revenue as the lease for these grazing rights was executed on January 8, 2018, at the time of the sale of the cattle herd. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in farm lease revenue as a result of a lease not being renewed in fiscal year 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 was approximately $10,998,000, compared to approximately $15,146,000 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, was primarily due to professional fees, relating to a corporate litigation matter, of approximately $2,300,000 being incurred for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. This litigation was settled and no further expenses were incurred relating to this matter during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. Additionally, as part of this settlement, the Company recorded consulting and separation fees of $800,000 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. The Company also experienced a reduction due to (i) a one-time pension expense related to its deferred retirement benefit plan of approximately $965,000 in fiscal year 2019, (ii) a reduction in payroll expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 of approximately $331,000 relating to one of the senior managers resigning in December 2019 and a reduction in bonuses granted to senior management, (iii) a decrease in stock compensation expense of approximately $204,000 as a result of certain stock options expense being accelerated in fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 and (iv) other smaller decreases in rent, consulting and Board of Director fees aggregating approximately $445,000. Partially offsetting these decreases was a lower amount of stock compensation expense of $823,000 recognized in fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 as a result of a former senior executive forfeiting his stock options as part of the settled litigation and an increase in Directors and Officers insurance of approximately $247,000.\nThe slight increase in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to an increase in professional fees, relating to a corporate litigation matter, of approximately $2,300,000 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. This litigation has been resolved with a settlement being reached on February 11, 2019. The Company does not anticipate further professional fees relating to this litigation. Additionally, as part of this settlement, the Company recorded consulting and separation fees of $800,000 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. The Company also recorded a one-time pension expense related to its deferred retirement benefit plan of approximately $965,000 in fiscal year 2019. Partially offsetting these increases were decreases in expenses due to (i) a reduction in stock compensation expense of $823,000 as a result of a former senior executive forfeiting his stock options as part of the settled litigation, (ii) a reduction in rent expense of approximately $450,000 as a result of the Company not renewing its lease for office space in New York City, (iii) an acceleration of stock compensation expense in fiscal year 2018 of approximately $782,000 as a result of two senior executives forfeiting a portion of their stock options, and (iv) a reduction in payroll costs of approximately $1,261,000. The reduction in payroll costs was primarily from (i) a reduction in separation expenses of approximately $388,000; (ii) a reduction in accrual for paid-time-off of approximately $100,000; and (iii) a reduction in executive compensation expense of approximately $725,000 relating to the resignation of a former senior executive.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $24,456,000 and approximately $5,019,000, respectively. The increase in other income, net was primarily due to the Company recording a higher gain on sale of real estate, property and equipment and assets held for sale in fiscal year 2020, as compared to fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $30,424,000, which was generated primarily from the sale of land on its West Ranch in September 2020 to the State of Florida. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $13,166,000, which was generated primarily for the sale of land on its West Ranch in September 2019. Additionally, the Company recognized a reduction of approximately $1,199,000 in interest expense in fiscal year 2020 as a result of (i) the reduction of its long-term debt attributable to making its mandatory principal payments, (ii) the Company prepaying approximately $4,455,000 on its debt obligations and (iii) a reduction in interest rates.\nOther income, net for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $5,019,000 and approximately $2,655,000, respectively. The increase in other income, net was primarily due to the Company recording a higher gain on sale of real estate, property and equipment and assets held for sale in fiscal year 2019, as compared to fiscal year 2018. In fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $13,166,000, which was generated primarily for the sale of land on its West Ranch in September 2019. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Company recorded a gain of $11,041,000 on the sale of real estate, property and equipment and assets held for sale, which included its corporate office building in Fort Myers, Florida, its Gal Hog property and a land parcel within its East Ranch resulting in gains of approximately $1,751,000, $6,709,000 and $1,759,000, respectively. Additionally, the Company incurred less interest expense of approximately $1,381,000 in fiscal year 2019, as compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to the Company recording imputed interest expense during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 relating to its Sugarcane transaction, which was terminated in fiscal year 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the provision for income taxes was approximately $7,663,000, $12,783,000 and $390,000, respectively, and the related effective income tax rates were approximately 24.50%, 25.45% and 2.96%, respectively. The change in the tax provision for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 is the result of the Company generating less net income during the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nThe change in the tax provision for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 was the result of the Company generating greater net income during fiscal year 2019, as compared to the prior fiscal year. Additionally, a one-time non-cash deferred income tax benefit of approximately $9,847,000 was recorded in fiscal year 2018 which resulted from the remeasurement of the Company's net deferred tax liabilities due to the 21% corporate tax rate that was enacted December 22, 2017, and an effect of the expiration of its capital loss carryforward, which expired at September 30, 2018, of approximately $5,634,000 which was recorded in fiscal year 2018, thus resulting in an additional income tax expense.\nSeasonality\nThe Company is primarily engaged in the production of fruit for sale to citrus markets, which is of a seasonal nature, and subject to the influence of natural phenomena and wide price fluctuations. Historically, the second and third quarters of Alico's fiscal year produce the majority of the Company's annual revenue. Working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year, coinciding with harvesting cycles. Because of the seasonality of the business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nA comparative balance sheet summary is presented in the following table:\nAlico's business has historically generated positive net cash flows from operating activities. Sources of cash primarily include cash flows from operations, sales of under-performing land and other assets, amounts available under the Company's credit facilities and access to capital markets. Access to additional borrowings under revolving lines of credit is subject to the satisfaction of customary borrowing conditions. As a public company, Alico may have access to other sources of capital. However, access to, and availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including (i) financial condition, prospects and credit rating, (ii) liquidity of the overall capital markets and (iii) the state of the economy. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe principal uses of cash that affect Alico's liquidity position include the following: operating expenses including employee costs, the cost of maintaining the citrus groves, harvesting and hauling of citrus products, capital expenditures, stock repurchases, dividends, debt service costs including interest and principal payments on term loans and other credit facilities and acquisitions.\nManagement believes that a combination of cash-on-hand, cash generated from operations, asset sales and availability under the Company's lines of credit will provide sufficient liquidity to service the principal and interest payments on its indebtedness, and will satisfy working capital requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months and over the long term. Alico has a $70,000,000 working capital line of credit, of which approximately $66,659,000 is available for general use as of September 30, 2020, and a $25,000,000 revolving line of credit, all of which is available for general use as of September 30, 2020 (see Note 6. \u201cLong-Term Debt and Lines of Credit\" to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements). If the Company pursues significant growth and other corporate opportunities, it could have a material adverse impact on its cash balances, and may need to finance such activities by drawing down monies under its lines of credit or by obtaining additional debt or equity financing. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to the Company when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Any inability to obtain additional financing could impact Alico's ability to pursue different growth and other corporate opportunities.\nThe level of debt could have important consequences on Alico's business, including, but not limited to, increasing its vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting the availability of cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements, and limiting flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and industry.\nCash Management Impacts\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased from approximately $23,838,000 as of September 30, 2019 to approximately $19,687,000 as of September 30, 2020. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased from approximately $32,260,000 as of September 30, 2018 to approximately $23,838,000 as of September 30, 2019. The components of these changes are discussed below.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nThe following table details the items contributing to the changes in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash for fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nNet Cash Provided By Operating Activities\nThe decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in fiscal year 2019, was primarily due to (i) an increase in gain on sale of real estate, property and equipment and assets held for sale in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, relating to the sale of certain sections of the West Ranch, (ii) a decrease in net income, which was primarily driven by decreased citrus sales, (iii) a decrease in the deferred retirement benefit as a result of the Company terminating its pension plan and paying all participants on August 30, 2020 and (iv) a decrease in working capital as a result of the payment of income taxes and an increase in accounts receivable related to the Company\u2019s grove management services whereby the Company pays all growing costs and then is reimbursed in the future from proceeds of fruit sales of the third-party.\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the same period in fiscal year 2018, was primarily due to (i) an increase in net income which was primarily driven by increased citrus sales and the receipt of federal disaster relief funds relating to Hurricane and (ii) an increase in working capital, which is due to a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in income taxes payable.\nDue to the seasonal nature of Alico's business, working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of its fiscal year. Cash flows from operating activities typically improve in the second and third fiscal quarters, as sales of its harvested citrus are made.\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities\nThe following table details the items contributing to Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nThe shift from net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 to net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in proceeds received on the sale of certain assets sold during fiscal year 2020, as compared to fiscal year 2019. This is due to the Company divesting of more acres of land in fiscal year 2020, as compared to fiscal year 2019 (see Note 4. \u201cAssets Held for Sale\u201d and Note 5. \u201cProperty & Equipment, Net\u201d to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe change from net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 to net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds received on the sale of certain assets sold during fiscal year 2019, as compared to fiscal year 2018. This is due to the Company divesting of several more assets in fiscal year 2018, as compared to fiscal year 2019 (see Note 4. \u201cAssets Held for Sale\u201d and Note 5. \u201cProperty & Equipment, Net\u201d to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, the shift, to a smaller extent, was due to an increase in capital expenditures which was driven by the purchase of certain land blocks within its existing grove location.\nNet Cash Used In Financing Activities\nThe following table details the items contributing to Net Cash Used In Financing Activities for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nThe decrease in net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, was primarily due to the Company repurchasing its common shares through a tender offer in October 2018 for an aggregate approximate amount of $25,576,000 and the termination of its 2014 Post-Closing Agreement in March 2019 pursuant to which the Company paid $11,300,000. Partially offsetting this shift was a prepayment of one of its long-term debt obligations in November 2019 in the amount of $4,455,000.\nThe increase in net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, was primarily due to the Company purchasing 752,234 common shares through a tender offer, for an aggregate amount of approximately $25,576,000, the termination of its 2014 Post-Closing Agreement relating to sugarcane transaction pursuant to which the Company paid approximately $11,300,000, and a pay down, net of borrowings, of its revolving line of credit by approximately $2,265,000.\nAlico had approximately $2,942,000 outstanding on its revolving lines of credit as of September 30, 2020 and approximately $91,659,000 remaining availability.\nThe WCLC line of credit agreement provides for Rabo Agrifinance, Inc. to issue up to $2,000,000 in letters of credit on the Company\u2019s behalf. As of September 30, 2020, there was approximately $399,000 in outstanding letters of credit, which correspondingly slightly reduced Alico's availability under the line of credit.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone\nContractual Obligations\nAlico has various contractual obligations which are fixed and determinable. The following table presents the Company's significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments on an undiscounted basis as of September 30, 2020 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash.\nPurchase Commitments\nThe Company enters into contracts for the purchase of citrus trees during the normal course of its business. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had approximately $3,014,000 relating to outstanding commitments for these purchases, which will be paid upon delivery.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nOur financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historic dollars. Changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession generally are not considered. The primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. In our management\u2019s opinion, changes in interest rates affect the financial condition to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including changes in the expected rate of inflation, the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAlico's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in those financial statements and accompanying notes. Management considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Company's financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Alico considers policies relating to the following matters to be critical accounting policies:\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount it expects to be entitled to be paid, determined when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers, which occurs upon delivery of and acceptance of the fruit by the customer and the Company has a right to payment. For grove management services, the Company recognizes operating revenue, including a management fee, when services are rendered and consumed. The Company recognized revenues from cattle sales at the time the cattle were delivered. Management reviews the reasonableness of the revenue accruals quarterly based on buyers\u2019 and processors\u2019 advances to growers, cash and futures markets and experience in the industry. Adjustments are made throughout the fiscal year to these estimates as more current relevant industry information becomes available. Differences between the estimates and the final realization of revenues can be significant and can be either positive or negative. During the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no material adjustments were made to the reported revenues from our crops.\nInventories\nThe costs of growing crops, including but not limited to labor, fertilization, fuel, crop nutrition and irrigation, are capitalized into inventory throughout the respective crop year. Such costs are expensed as cost of sales when the crops are harvested and are recorded as operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost for unharvested citrus crops is based on accumulated production costs incurred during the period from January 1 through the balance sheet date.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Major improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repairs are expensed in the period the cost is incurred. Costs related to the development of citrus groves, through planting of trees, are capitalized. Such costs include land clearing, excavation and construction of ditches, dikes, roads and reservoirs among other costs. After the planting, caretaking costs or pre-productive maintenance costs are capitalized for four years. After four years, a grove is considered to have reached maturity and the accumulated costs are depreciated over 25 years, except for land clearing and excavation, which are considered costs of land and not depreciated.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable and those deferred as a result of temporary differences between the financial statements and the income tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies are considered and evaluated when assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Any increase or decrease in a valuation allowance could have a material adverse or beneficial impact on the Company\u2019s income tax provision and net income or loss in the period the determination is made. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded valuation allowances of $0, $0, and $5,634,000, respectively, relating to the unutilized capital loss carryforwards which expired. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nThe Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which a change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations, other than goodwill, when events and circumstances indicate that the asset or asset group might be impaired and the estimated cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by those assets or asset group over the remaining lives of the assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets. In calculating impairments and the estimated cash flows, the Company assigns its asset groups by determining the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of the other Company assets. The net carrying values of assets or asset groups not recoverable are reduced to their fair values. Our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimates of future market conditions and operating conditions. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, long-lived assets were comprised of property and equipment.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe carrying amounts in the balance sheets for operating accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these items. The carrying amounts reported for our long-term debt approximates fair value as our borrowings with commercial lenders are at interest rates that vary with market conditions and fixed rates that approximate market rates for comparable loans.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized into one of three different levels depending on the assumptions (i.e., inputs) used in the valuation. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is defined as follows:\nLevel 1- Valuations are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2- Valuations are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices in markets that are not active for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3- Valuations are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Inputs reflect management\u2019s best estimate of what market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability at the measurement date.\nImpact of Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data\" - Note 1. \"Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\" for additional information about the impact of accounting pronouncements.\nSubsequent Events\nOn December 2, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 of $0.18 per share on its outstanding common stock to be paid to shareholders of record as of December 24, 2020, with payment expected on January 8, 2021.\nIn November 2020, the Company awarded 5,885 shares of restricted stock to certain officers and managers under the 2015 Plan.\nCompensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.\nOn December 2, 2019, the Company entered into a new employment agreement (the \u201cRallo Employment Agreement\u201d) with Richard Rallo. Mr. Rallo serves as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. The Rallo Employment Agreement provides for an annual base salary of $275,000. Mr. Rallo is eligible for an annual incentive compensation award with an annual target opportunity in an amount equal to 40% of his annual base salary.\nThe Rallo Employment Agreement also provides that, if Mr. Rallo\u2019s employment is terminated by the Company without \u201ccause\u201d or Mr. Rallo resigns with \u201cgood reason\u201d (as each such term is defined in the Rallo Employment Agreement), then, subject to his execution, delivery, and non-revocation of a general release of claims in favor of the Company, Mr. Rallo will be entitled to (i) cash severance in an amount equal to 12 months of the annual base salary, (ii) the Accrued Obligations (as defined in the Rallo Employment Agreement) in a cash lump sum within 30 days after the date of termination, (iii) any rights or payments that are vested benefits or that Mr. Rallo is otherwise entitled to receive at or subsequent to the date of termination under any employee benefit plan or any other contract or agreement with the Company, and (iv) any Annual Bonus (as defined in the Rallo Employment Agreement) that has been earned but not paid as of the date of termination.\nThe Rallo Employment Agreement includes various restrictive covenants in favor of the Company, including a confidentiality covenant, a non-disparagement covenant, and 12-month post-termination noncompetition and customer and employee non-solicitation covenants.\nIn addition to his position as Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Rallo retains his position as the Company\u2019s Principal Accounting Officer.\nThe foregoing description of the Rallo Employment Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Rallo Employment agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.37 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nMarket Risk - Market risk represents the potential loss resulting from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments, either derivative or non-derivative, caused by fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity security prices. The Company handles market risks in accordance with its established policies; however, Alico does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company does consider, on occasion, the need to enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates; however, the Company entered into no such instruments during the three-year period ended September 30, 2020. The Company held various financial instruments as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, consisting of financial assets and liabilities reported in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets and off-balance sheet exposures resulting from letters of credit issued for the benefit of Alico.\nInterest Rate Risk - The Company is subject to interest rate risk from the utilization of financial instruments such as term loan debt and other borrowings. The Company\u2019s primary long-term obligations are fixed rate debts subject to fair value risk due to interest rate fluctuations. The Company believes that the carrying value of our long-term debt approximates fair value given the stability of market interest rates.\nThe Company is also subject to interest rate risk on its variable rate debt. A one-percentage-point increase in prevailing interest rates would have increased interest expense on our variable rate debt obligations by approximately $424,000 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.\nForeign-Exchange Rate Risk - The Company currently has no exposure to foreign-exchange rate risk because all of its financial transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.\nCommodity Price Risk - The Company has no financial instruments subject to commodity price risk.\nEquity Security Price Risk - None of the Company\u2019s financial instruments have potential exposure to equity security price risk.",

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.\nOrlando, Florida\nDecember 8, 2020\nALICO, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nALICO, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nALICO, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\n(in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nALICO, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nALICO, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\nDescription of Business\nAlico, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, \u201cAlico\u201d, the \u201cCompany\", \"we\", \"us\" or \"our\u201d), is a Florida agribusiness and land management company owning approximately 100,000 acres of land throughout Florida, holding mineral rights on approximately 90,000 of those owned acres. The Company manages its land based upon its primary usage, and reviews its performance based upon two primary classifications: (i) Alico Citrus and (ii) Land Management and Other Operations. Financial results are presented based upon its two business segments (Alico Citrus and Land Management and Other Operations).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company has prepared the accompanying financial statements on a consolidated basis. These accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, which are referred to herein as the \u201cFinancial Statements\u201d, have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). All significant intercompany transactions and account balances between the consolidated businesses have been eliminated.\nSegments\nOperating segments are defined in the criteria established under the Financial Accounting Standards Board - Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cFASB ASC\u201d) Topic 280 as components of public entities that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses for which separate financial information is available and which is evaluated regularly by the Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources. The Company\u2019s CODM assesses performance and allocates resources based on two operating segments: (i) Alico Citrus and (ii) Land Management and Other Operations.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Financial Statements include the accounts of Alico and the accounts of all the subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is held by the Company. Under U.S. GAAP, consolidation is generally required for investments of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of an investee, except when control is not held by the majority owner. The Company\u2019s subsidiaries include: Alico Land Development, Inc., Alico-Agri, Ltd., Alico Plant World, LLC, Alico Fruit Company, LLC, Alico Citrus Nursery, LLC, Alico Chemical Sales, LLC, 734 Citrus Holdings, LLC and subsidiaries, Alico Fresh Fruit, LLC, Alico Skink Mitigation, LLC and Citree Holdings 1, LLC (\u201cCitree\u201d). The Company considers the criteria established under FASB ASC Topic 810, \u201cConsolidations\u201d in its consolidation process. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the accompanying Financial Statements, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and cash flows during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company evaluates estimates on an ongoing basis. The estimates are based on current and expected economic conditions, historical experience, the experience and judgment of the Company\u2019s management and various other specific assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable.\nNoncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Subsidiary\nThe Financial Statements include all assets and liabilities of the less-than-100%-owned subsidiary the Company controls, Citree. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a noncontrolling interest in the equity of such entity. Citree had net income of $107,051 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 and net losses of $781,783, and $511,854 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of which $54,596 of net income and $398,709 and $261,046 of net losses was attributable to the Company for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The shift to net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 was the result of reimbursements received under the federal relief program relating to Hurricane Irma, aggregating approximately $493,000.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, \u201cIntangibles-Goodwill and Other\u201d (Topic 350), which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment. The updated guidance eliminates Step 2 of the impairment test, which requires entities to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit\u2019s carrying amount over its fair value, determined in Step 1. This guidance will become effective for us in the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those reporting periods. We will adopt this guidance using a prospective approach. Earlier adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2017-04 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2020.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, \u201cFair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements\u201d (\u201cASU 2018-13\u201d), which aims to improve the overall usefulness of disclosures to financial statement users and reduce unnecessary costs to companies when preparing fair value measurement disclosures. ASU 2018-13 is effective for annual and interim periods in the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. Retrospective adoption is required, except for certain disclosures, which will be required to be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2018-13 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2020.\nIn November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, \u201cCodification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses.\u201d ASU 2018-19 clarifies that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of Subtopic 326-20. Instead, impairment of receivables arising from operating leases should be accounted for in accordance with Leases (Topic 842). The standard is effective for the Company on October 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2018-19 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in the existing guidance for income taxes and making other minor improvements. The amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company on October 1, 2021. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2019-12 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2021.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The Company\u2019s floating rate notes and variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. If LIBOR ceases to exist, the Company may need to renegotiate its loan agreements and the Company cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with its lenders. ASU 2020-04 is currently effective and upon adoption may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made on or before December 31, 2022. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard and the impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company has reviewed other recently issued accounting standards which have not yet been adopted in order to determine their potential effect, if any, on the results of operations or financial condition. Based on the review of these other recently issued standards, the Company does not currently believe that any of those accounting pronouncements will have a significant effect on its current or future financial position, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d, and subsequently issued several supplemental and/or clarifying ASU\u2019s (collectively, \u201cASC 606\u201d), which prescribes a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that supersedes previously existing revenue recognition guidance. The new model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle of the new guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also requires new, expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition. The standard allows initial application to be performed retrospectively to each period presented or as a modified retrospective adjustment as of the date of adoption. ASC 606 also provides for certain practical expedients, including the option to expense as incurred the incremental costs of obtaining a contract, if the contract period is for one year or less, and policy elections regarding shipping and handling that provides the option to account for shipping and handling costs as contract fulfillment costs. The Company adopted ASC 606 effective October 1, 2018, the first day of its 2019 fiscal year, using the modified retrospective method. The implementation of ASC 606 did not require an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of October 1, 2018 (see Note 2. \u201cRevenue Recognition\u201d).\nIn February 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-05, \u201cOther Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets\u201d (ASC 610-20): Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets. This standard clarifies the scope and application of ASC 610-20 on the sale, transfer, and derecognition of nonfinancial assets and in substance nonfinancial assets to non-customers, including partial sales. It also provides guidance on how gains and losses on transfers of nonfinancial assets and in substance nonfinancial assets to non-customers are recognized. The standard also clarifies the derecognition of businesses is under the scope of ASC 810. The standard was required to be adopted concurrently with ASC 606, however an entity did not have to apply the same transition method as ASC 606. The Company adopted ASC 610-20 (\u201cASC 610-20\u201d) effective October 1, 2018, the first day of its 2019 fiscal year, using the modified retrospective method. The implementation of ASC 610-20 resulted in an adjustment to increase the opening balance of retained earnings by $10,897,000, net of taxes, as of October 1, 2018. As a result of the ASU 610-20, guidance specific to real estate sales in ASC 360-20 will be eliminated. As such, sales and partial sales of real estate assets will now be subject to the same derecognition model as all other nonfinancial assets.\nThe ASU 610-20 will also impact the accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets (including in substance real estate). When an entity transfers its controlling interest in a nonfinancial asset, but retains a noncontrolling ownership interest, the entity will measure the retained interest at fair value. This will result in full gain/loss recognition upon the sale of a controlling interest in a nonfinancial asset. Current guidance generally prohibits gain recognition on the retained interest.\nThe ASU 610-20 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years and thus was effective for the Company for our fiscal year beginning October 1, 2018. The ASU 610-20 will be applied prospectively to any transaction occurring from the date of adoption. The Company adopted ASU 360-20 effective October 1, 2018. The new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements as it relates to the deferred gain on the sale of the Company\u2019s sugarcane lands (see Note 8. \u201cDeferred Gain on Sale\u201d).\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, \u201cStatement of Cash Flows (Topic 230).\u201d This ASU will provide guidance on the presentation and classification of specific cash flow items to improve consistency within the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for the Company for our fiscal year beginning October 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2016-15 effective September 30, 2019 and the impact under this ASU is that the Company reported certain proceeds from insurance claims relating to property and equipment in the statement of cash flows as investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842).\u201d This guidance requires entities that sign leases as a lessee to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for those leases classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under previous U.S. GAAP. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 on October 1, 2019.\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company\u2019s leases consist of operating lease arrangements for certain office space, tractor leases and IT facilities. When these lease arrangements include lease and non-lease components, the Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance) separately based on their relative standalone prices.\nAny lease arrangements with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Company\u2019s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and it recognizes lease cost for these lease arrangements on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many lease arrangements provide the options to exercise one or more renewal terms or to terminate the lease arrangement. The Company includes these options when it will be reasonably certain to exercise them in the lease term used to establish the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Generally, lease agreements do not include an option to purchase the leased asset, residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nAs most of our lease arrangements do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company applies an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date of the lease arrangement to determine the present value of lease payments.\nNo lease costs associated with finance leases and sale-leaseback transactions occurred and our lease income associated with lessor and sublease arrangements are not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur operating leases are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:\nOur operating leases cost components are reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:\nFuture maturities of our operating lease obligations as of September 30, 2020 by fiscal year are as follows:\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for our operating leases are as follows:\nCash flow information related to leases consists of the following:\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the current novel coronavirus outbreak (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) to be a global pandemic. In response to this declaration and the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the United States, federal, state and local governments throughout the country have imposed varying degrees of restrictions on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the illness. These measures have had a significant adverse impact upon many sectors of the economy, including certain agriculture businesses. To date, the Company has experienced no material adverse impact from this pandemic.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified in the accompanying Financial Statements for consistent presentation to the current period. These reclassifications had no impact on net income, equity, cash flows or working capital as previously reported.\nSeasonality\nThe Company is primarily engaged in the production of fruit for sale to citrus markets, which is of a seasonal nature, and subject to the influence of natural phenomena and wide price fluctuations. Historically, the second and third quarters of Alico's fiscal year produce the majority of the Company's annual revenue. Working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year, coinciding with harvesting cycles. Because of the seasonality of the business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are derived from the sale of processed fruit, fresh fruit, other citrus revenue, leasing revenue and other resource revenues. The majority of the revenue is generated from the sale of citrus fruit to processing facilities, fresh fruit sales and grove management services.\nFor fruit sales, the Company recognizes revenue at the amount it expects to be entitled to be paid, determined when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers, which occurs upon delivery of and acceptance of the fruit by the customer and the Company has a right to payment.\nThe Company has identified one performance obligation as the delivery of fruit to the processing facility (or harvesting of the citrus in the case of fresh fruit) of the customer for each separate variety of fruit identified in the contract. The Company initially recognizes revenue in an amount which is estimated based on contractual and market prices, if such market price falls within the range (known as \u201cfloor\u201d and \u201cceiling\u201d prices) identified in the specific contracts. Additionally, the Company also has a contractual agreement whereby revenue is determined based on applying a cost-plus structure methodology. As such, since these contracts contain elements of variable consideration, the Company recognizes this variable consideration by using the expected value method. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the reasonableness of the revenues accrued based on buyers\u2019 and processors\u2019 advances to growers, cash and futures markets and experience in the industry. Adjustments are made throughout the year to these estimates as more current relevant industry information becomes available. Differences between the estimates and the final realization of revenues at the close of the harvesting season can result in either an increase or decrease to reported revenues. During the periods presented, no material adjustments were made to the reported citrus revenues.\nReceivables under contracts, whereby pricing is based on contractual and market prices, are primarily paid at the floor amount and are collected within seven days after the harvest week. Any adjustments to pricing as a result of changes in market prices are collected or paid thirty to sixty days after final market pricing is published. Receivables under contracts, whereby pricing is based off a cost-plus structure methodology, are paid at the final prior year rate. Any adjustments to pricing as a result of the cost-plus calculation are collected or paid upon finalization of the calculation and agreement by both parties. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company had total receivables relating to sales of citrus of $584,000 and $160,000, respectively, recorded in Accounts Receivable, net, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor grove management services, the Company has identified one performance obligation relating to the management of the third party\u2019s groves. Grove management services include caretaking of the citrus groves, harvesting and hauling of citrus, management and coordination of citrus sales and other related activities. The Company is reimbursed for expenses incurred in the execution of its management duties and the Company receives a per acre management fee. The Company recognizes operating revenue, including a management fee, and corresponding operating expenses when services are rendered and consumed.\nDisaggregated Revenue\nRevenues disaggregated by significant products and services for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\nDuring the time that Alico was engaged in the business of raising and selling cattle, Alico recognized revenues from cattle sales at the time the cattle were delivered.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of the Company\u2019s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short term and immediate nature of these financial instruments. The carrying amounts of the Company\u2019s debt approximates fair value as the debt is with commercial lenders at interest rates that vary with market conditions or have fixed rates that approximate market rates for obligations with similar terms and maturities (see Note 8. \u201cFair Value Measurements\u201d).\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers cash in banks and highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. At various times throughout the fiscal year, and as of September 30, 2020, some accounts held at financial institutions were in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000. The Company has not experienced any losses on these accounts and believes credit risk to be minimal.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash is comprised of certain cash receipts from the sale of property which was being held specifically for the purpose of deferring a tax impact on the gain on sale of the property and other cash received from the sale of certain assets in which the use of funds were restricted.\nIn September 2020, the Company sold certain sections of the West Ranch, from which a portion of the net cash proceeds amounting to $16,524,000 were being held by a qualified intermediary in coordination to purchase a like-kind asset and defer a portion of the gain on sale of the ranch land. Such funds were included in restricted cash. In October 2020, the Company closed on a purchase of a like-kind asset and used all of these net cash proceeds which was being held by the intermediary (see Note 17. \u201cSubsequent Events\u201d).\nFor certain sales transactions, the Company sells property which serves as collateral for specific debt obligations. As a result, the sale proceeds are only permitted to be used to purchase like-kind citrus groves acceptable to the debt holder or to pay down existing debt obligations and thus are included in restricted cash. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company utilized restricted cash of $1,800,000 towards the purchase of citrus groves. Such purchases are included as part of the collateral under certain debt obligations. Additionally, in November 2019, the Company utilized restricted cash to pay down existing debt, including outstanding interest on such debt, in the amount of $4,489,000. In July 2020, the remaining restricted cash of approximately $719,000 relating to collateral property under debt obligations, including interest earned in the account, was released without further obligation to the Company.\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable from customers are generated from revenues based on the sale of citrus, grove management, leasing and other transactions. The Company grants credit in the course of its operations to third party customers. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers\u2019 financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for amounts which are not probable of collection. The estimate, evaluated quarterly by the Company, is based on historical collection experience, current macroeconomic climate and market conditions and a review of the current status of each customer\u2019s account. Changes in the financial viability of significant customers and worsening of economic conditions may require changes to its estimate of the recoverability of the receivables. Such changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which these changes become known. The bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table presents accounts receivable, net as of September 30, 2020 and 2019:\nConcentrations\nAccounts receivable from the Company\u2019s major customer as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 and revenue from such customers for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, are as follows:\nThe citrus industry is subject to various factors over which growers have limited or no control, including weather conditions, disease, pestilence, water supply and market price fluctuations. Market prices are highly sensitive to aggregate domestic and foreign crop sizes, as well as factors including, but not limited to, weather and competition from foreign countries.\nReal Estate\nIn recognizing revenues from land sales, the Company applies specific revenue recognition criteria, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to determine when land sales revenues can be recorded. For example, in order to fully recognize a gain resulting from a real estate transaction, the sale must be consummated with a sufficient down payment of at least 20% to 25% of the sales price depending upon the type and timeframe for development of the property sold and any receivable from the sale cannot be subject to future subordination. In addition, the seller cannot retain any material continuing involvement in the property sold. When these criteria are not met, the Company recognizes a gain proportionate to collections utilizing either the installment method or deposit method as appropriate.\nInventories\nThe costs of growing crops, including but not limited to labor, fertilization, fuel, crop nutrition, irrigation, and depreciation, are capitalized into inventory throughout the respective crop year. Such costs are expensed as cost of sales when the crops are harvested and are recorded as operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost for unharvested citrus crops is based on accumulated production costs incurred during the period from January 1 through the balance sheet date.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization. Major improvements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. Costs related to the development of citrus groves through planting of trees are capitalized. Such costs include land clearing, excavation and construction of ditches, dikes, roads, and reservoirs, among other costs. After the planting, caretaking costs or pre-productive maintenance costs are capitalized for 4 years. After 4 years, a planting is considered to have reached maturity and the accumulated costs are depreciated over 25 years, except for land clearing and excavation, which are considered costs of land and not depreciated.\nReal estate costs incurred for the acquisition, development and construction of real estate projects are capitalized.\nDepreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets, with the exception of leasehold improvements and assets acquired through capital leases, which are depreciated over their estimated useful lives if the lease transfers ownership or contains a bargain purchase option, otherwise the term of the lease.\nThe estimated useful lives for property and equipment are primarily as follows:\nChanges in circumstances, such as technological advances or changes to our business model or capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from the original estimates. In those cases where the Company determines that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened, Alico depreciates the asset over its revised estimated remaining useful life, thereby increasing depreciation expense (see Note 5. \u201cProperty and Equipment, Net\u201d).\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations, or asset group, when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the estimated cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by those assets or asset group over the remaining lives of the assets or asset group are less than the carrying amounts of those assets. In calculating impairments and the estimated cash flows, the Company assigns its asset groups by determining the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of the other Company assets. The net carrying values of assets or asset group not recoverable are reduced to their fair values. Alico's cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect best estimates of future market conditions and operating conditions. For fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded impairments to its long-lived assets (see Note 5. \u201cProperty and Equipment, Net\u201d). As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, long-lived assets were comprised of property and equipment.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the fair value of the assets acquired less liabilities assumed in connection with such acquisition. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives acquired in an acquisition are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually, on the same date, or more frequently should an event occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may be a significant change in business climate, economic and industry trends, legal factors, negative operating performance indicators, significant competition, changes in strategy or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof.\nIn the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, Alico has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary or to perform a quantitative assessment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Under the qualitative assessment, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. If, under the quantitative assessment, the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the amount of the impairment loss, if any, must be measured under step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, Alico would record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill over its implied fair value, should such a circumstance arise. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, no impairment was required.\nOther Non-Current Assets\nOther non-current assets primarily include investments owned in agricultural cooperatives, cash surrender value on life insurance, and deposits on the purchase of citrus trees. Investments in stock related to agricultural cooperatives are carried at cost.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable and those deferred as a result of temporary differences between the financial statements and the income tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies are considered and evaluated when assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Any increase or decrease in a valuation allowance could have a material adverse or beneficial impact on the Company\u2019s income tax provision and net income or loss in the period the determination is made. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded valuation allowances of $0, $0, and $5,634,000, respectively, relating to the unutilized capital loss carryforwards which expired. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nThe Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which a change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share for the Company\u2019s common stock is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Alico common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share is similarly calculated, except that the calculation includes the dilutive effect of the assumed issuance of shares of common stock issuable under equity-based compensation plans in accordance with the treasury stock method, or any other type of securities convertible into common stock, except where the inclusion of such common shares would have an anti-dilutive effect.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, the Company issued 118,000, 10,000, and 300,000, respectively, stock options to certain executives and managers of the Company. Non-vested restricted shares of common stock entitle the holder to receive non-forfeitable dividends upon issuance and are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is measured based on the fair value of the equity award at the grant date and is typically expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Upon the vesting of restricted stock, the Company issues common stock from common shares held in treasury.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense for the three years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 in general and administrative expense was as follows:\nNote 3. Inventories\nInventories consist of the following at September 30, 2020 and 2019:\nThe Company records its inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company recorded adjustments of approximately $808,000 to reduce inventory to net realizable value. This adjustment to inventory is included in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nIn September 2017, the State of Florida\u2019s citrus business, including the Company\u2019s unharvested citrus crop, was significantly impacted by Hurricane Irma. The impact of Hurricane Irma resulted in the premature drop of unharvested fruit and damage to citrus trees.\nThe Company is eligible for Hurricane Irma federal relief programs for block grants that are being administered through the State of Florida. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company received approximately $15,597,000 under the Florida Citrus Recovery Block Grant (\u201cCRBG\u201d) program. This represents the Part 1 and a portion of the Part 2 reimbursement under the three-part program. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, the Company received additional proceeds of approximately $4,629,000 under the Florida CRBG program. This represented the remaining portion of Part 2 reimbursement under the three-part program. The timing and amount to be received under Part 3 of the program has not been finalized. These federal relief proceeds are included as a reduction to operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company received insurance proceeds relating to Hurricane Irma of approximately $486,000 in additional property and casualty claims reimbursement. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Company received insurance proceeds relating to Hurricane Irma of approximately $477,000 for property and casualty damage claims and approximately $8,952,000 for crop claims. These insurance proceeds are included as a reduction to operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There are no further property and casualty or crop insurance claims pending relating to Hurricane Irma.\nNote 4. Assets Held for Sale\nIn accordance with its strategy to dispose of non-core and under-performing assets, the following assets have been classified as assets held for sale as of September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019:\nOn September 10, 2020, the State of Florida purchased, under the Florida Forever program, approximately 10,702 acres of the Alico Ranch for approximately $28,500,000 pursuant to an option agreement entered between the State of Florida and the Company. The Company recognized a gain of approximately $27,470,000, which is included in Gain on sale of real estate, property and equipment and assets held for sale in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company subsequently used a portion of the net cash proceeds to purchase a like-kind asset in October 2020, which allowed the Company to defer a portion of the tax impact of the gain on sale of the ranch land (see Note 17. \u201cSubsequent Events\u201d).\nOn March 27, 2020, the Company sold certain sections at the East Ranch for approximately $2,980,000 and realized a gain of approximately $2,748,000. The Company subsequently used substantially all of the net cash proceeds to purchase a like-kind asset in May 2020, which will allow the Company to defer substantially all of the tax impact of the gain on sale of the ranch land.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company sold certain trailers for approximately $47,000, and reclassified the remaining Assets Held for Sale to property and equipment, as management has determined not to offer the remaining trailers for sale.\nOn October 30, 2018, the Company sold certain parcels at Frostproof for approximately $206,000 and realized a gain of approximately $12,000.\nOn May 2, 2018, the Company sold its Gal Hog property for approximately $7,300,000 and recognized a gain of approximately $6,709,000.\nOn February 12, 2018, the Company sold its property at Chancey Bay for approximately $4,200,000 and realized a loss of approximately $51,000.

As part of this transaction, the purchaser is also leasing from the Company grazing and other rights on the Alico Ranch at a rate of $100,000 per month. Upon the sale of a parcel within the East Ranch, the lease rate was adjusted to $98,750 per month.\nOn January 19, 2018, the Company sold certain trailers to a third party for $500,000. The Company received $125,000 and the remaining portion is to be paid in accordance with a promissory note, which bears interest at 5%, over three years.\nOn October 30, 2017, the Company sold its corporate office building in Fort Myers, Florida for $5,300,000 and realized a gain of approximately $1,751,000. The sales agreement provides that the Company lease back a portion of the office space for five years. Such lease is classified as an operating lease.\nThe Company recorded no impairment loss during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. The Company recorded an impairment loss of approximately $152,000 and $150,000 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These impairment losses were included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company has already used a portion of the proceeds from these various asset sales to pay down debt (see Note 6. \"Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit\") and to purchase citrus groves and plans to use the remaining cash proceeds from the sale of these assets to purchase other citrus groves, pay down other debt and to fund future working capital requirements and for other corporate purposes.\nNote 5. Property and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net consists of the following at September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019:\nOn June 1, 2020, the Company sold approximately 30 ranch acres to an employee for approximately $122,000 and recognized a gain of approximately $83,000.\nOn May 4, 2020, the Company purchased 334 citrus acres for approximately $2,850,000. This acquisition complements the Company\u2019s existing citrus acres as these acres are located adjacent to existing groves in the Frostproof area. Additionally, this purchase was part of a like-kind exchange transaction, which allowed the Company to defer taxes relating to the sale of certain sections of the East Ranch.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company purchased 203 acres of citrus blocks for approximately $1,950,000. These purchases were made from grove owners from within the Company\u2019s existing grove locations. In April 2019, the lender, PGIM Real Estate Finance, LLC (\u201cPrudential\u201d), agreed to accept those purchases completed through April 2019 as substitute collateral and release $1,800,000 from restricted cash, which was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. After April 2019, there were two additional purchases of Citrus blocks for approximately $100,000 that are not included as part of the substitution collateral.\nOn September 27, 2019, the Company sold approximately 5,500 acres from its West Ranch for approximately $14,775,000 and realized a gain on sale of approximately $13,033,000. Upon the sale of these acres, the lease rate pertaining to the grazing and other rights was adjusted from $98,750 to $80,000 per month, as space on these acres was previously being leased to a third party.\nOn September 29, 2018, the Company sold its property at Island Pond for $7,900,000. As the Island Pond property was collateralized under one of the Company\u2019s loan documents, $7,000,000 of the proceeds was restricted in use.\nOn September 28, 2018, The Company sold a parcel within the East Ranch for approximately $1,920,000 and realized a gain of approximately $1,759,000.\nOn March 30, 2018, the Company sold property located on its Winter Haven location for approximately $225,000 and recognized a loss of approximately $50,000.\nOn March 15, 2018, the Company sold certain parcels comprised of citrus trees and land located on its Ranch One grove for approximately $586,000 and recognized a loss of approximately $87,000.\nFor fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded impairments of approximately $723,000, $244,000 and $2,084,000, respectively, relating to the loss of citrus trees.\nAs a result of the sale of a portion of the Alico Ranch to the State of Florida comprising approximately 10,700 acres on the western part of the ranch and because the sale of those acres affected the proposed dispersed water management project, the Company decided to suspend all permit approval activities for its dispersed water management project and the Company wrote-down approximately $598,000 of assets relating to this project during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.\nNote 6. Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit\nThe following table summarizes long-term debt and related deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization at September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019:\nThe following table summarizes lines of credit and related deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization at September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019:\nFuture maturities of long-term debt and lines of credit as of September 30, 2020 are as follows:\nInterest costs expensed and capitalized were as follows:\nDebt\nThe Company's credit facilities consist of $125,000,000 in fixed interest rate term loans (\u201cMet Fixed-Rate Term Loans\u201d), $57,500,000 in variable interest rate term loans (\u201cMet Variable-Rate Term Loans\u201d), a $25,000,000 revolving line of credit (\u201cRLOC\u201d) with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and New England Life Insurance Company (collectively \u201cMet\u201d), and a $70,000,000 working capital line of credit (\u201cWCLC\u201d) with Rabo Agrifinance, Inc. (\u201cRabo\u201d).\nThe term loans and RLOC are secured by real property. The security for the term loans and RLOC consists of approximately 38,200 gross acres of citrus groves and 5,800 gross acres of Ranch land. The WCLC is collateralized by the Company\u2019s current assets and certain other personal property owned by the Company.\nThe term loans, collectively, are subject to quarterly principal payments of $2,281,250, and mature November 1, 2029. The Met Fixed-Rate Term Loans bear interest at 4.15% per annum, and the Met Variable-Rate Term Loans bear interest at a rate equal to 90 day LIBOR plus 165 basis points (the \u201cLIBOR spread\u201d). The LIBOR spread is subject to adjustment by Met beginning May 1, 2017 and is subject to further adjustment every two years thereafter until maturity. No adjustment in the LIBOR spread was made at May 1, 2019. Interest on the term loans is payable quarterly. The interest rates on the Met Variable-Rate Term Loans were 1.91% per annum and 3.91% per annum as of September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively.\nThe Company may prepay up to $8,750,000 of the Met Fixed-Rate Term Loan principal annually without penalty, and any such prepayments may be applied to reduce subsequent mandatory principal payments. The maximum annual prepayment was made for calendar year 2015. During the first and second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company elected not to make its principal payment and utilized a portion of its 2015 prepayment to satisfy its principal payment requirements for such quarters. At September 30, 2020, the Company had $5,625,000, available from its 2015 prepayment to reduce future mandatory principal payments should the Company elect to do so. The Met Variable-Rate Term Loans may be prepaid without penalty.\nIn March 2020, as a precautionary measure, the Company drew down an aggregate of $70,000,000 on its revolving credit facilities; $20,000,000 on its RLOC and $50,000,000 on its WCLC. This decision was made to safeguard the Company\u2019s liquidity and to increase available cash on hand in the event of a more protracted COVID-19 outbreak. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had paid back a majority of the balances on these credit facilities.\nThe RLOC bears interest at a floating rate equal to 90 day LIBOR plus 165 basis points, payable quarterly. The LIBOR spread was adjusted by the lender on May 1, 2017 and is subject to further adjustment every two years thereafter. No adjustment in the LIBOR spread was made at May 1, 2019. In October 2019, the RLOC agreement was modified to extend the current maturity of November 1, 2019 to November 1, 2029. The RLOC is subject to an annual commitment fee of 25 basis points on the unused portion of the line of credit. The RLOC is available for funding general corporate needs. The variable interest rate was 1.91% per annum and 3.91% per annum as of September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. Availability under the RLOC was $25,000,000 as of September 30, 2020.\nThe WCLC is a revolving credit facility and is available for funding working capital and general corporate requirements. The interest rate on the WCLC is based on the one month LIBOR, plus a spread, which is adjusted quarterly, based on the Company's debt service coverage ratio for the preceding quarter and can vary from 175 to 250 basis points. The rate is currently at LIBOR plus 175 basis points. The variable interest rate was 1.90% per annum and 3.85% per annum as of September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. The WCLC agreement was amended on August 25, 2020, and the primary terms of the amendment were an extension of the maturity to November 1, 2023. There were no changes to the commitment amount or interest rate. Availability under the WCLC was approximately $66,659,000 and $69,540,000 as of September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively.\nThe WCLC is subject to a quarterly commitment fee on the daily unused availability under the line computed as the commitment amount less the aggregate of the outstanding loans and outstanding letters of credit. The commitment fee is adjusted quarterly based on Alico's debt service coverage ratio for the preceding quarter and can vary from a minimum of 20 basis points to a maximum of 30 basis points. Commitment fees to date have been charged at 20 basis points.\nThere was approximately $2,942,000 outstanding on the WCLC at September 30, 2020. The WCLC agreement provides for Rabo to issue up to $2,000,000, reduced from $20,000,000 during fiscal year 2019, in letters of credit on the Company\u2019s behalf. As of September 30, 2020, there was approximately $399,000 in outstanding letters of credit, which correspondingly reduced the Company's availability under the line of credit.\nIn 2014, the Company capitalized approximately $2,834,000 of debt financing costs related to the refinancing. These costs, together with approximately $339,000 of costs related to the retired debt, are being amortized to interest expense over the applicable terms of the loans. Additionally, approximately $23,000 and $133,000 of financing costs were incurred for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in connection with letters of credit. All previous costs are included in deferred financing costs and being amortized to interest expense over the applicable terms of the obligations. The unamortized balance of deferred financing costs related to the financing above was approximately $1,048,000 and approximately $1,066,000 at September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively.\nThese credit facilities noted above are subject to various covenants including the following financial covenants: (i) minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00, (ii) tangible net worth of at least $160,000,000 increased annually by 10% of consolidated net income for the preceding years, or approximately $167,336,000 for the year ended September 30, 2020, (iii) minimum current ratio of 1.50 to 1.00, (iv) debt to total assets ratio not greater than .625 to 1.00, and, (v) solely in the case of the WCLC, a limit on capital expenditures of $30,000,000 per fiscal year. As of September 30, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants.\nCredit facilities also include a Met Life term loan collateralized by 1,200 gross acres of citrus grove owned by Citree (\"Met Citree Loan\"). This is a $5,000,000 credit facility that bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.28% per annum. Principal and interest payments are made on a quarterly basis. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, there was an outstanding balance of $4,512,000 and $4,750,000, respectively. The loan matures in February 2029. The unamortized balance of deferred financing costs related to this loan was approximately $36,000 and $40,000 at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nTransition from LIBOR\nThe Company is currently evaluating the impact of the transition from LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark to other potential alternative reference rates. Currently, the Company has debt instruments in place that reference LIBOR-based rates. The transition from LIBOR is estimated to take place in 2022 and management will continue to actively assess the related opportunities and risks involved in this transition.\nSilver Nip Citrus Debt\nThere are two fixed-rate term loans, with an original combined balance of $27,550,000, bearing interest at 5.35% per annum (\u201cPru Loans A & B\u201d). Principal of $290,000 is payable quarterly, together with accrued interest. On February 15, 2015, 734 Citrus Holdings, LLC d/b/a Silver Nip Citrus (\u201cSilver Nip Citrus\u201d) made a prepayment of $750,000. In addition, the Company made prepayments of approximately $4,453,000 in the\nsecond fiscal quarter of 2018 with proceeds from the sale of certain properties, which were collateralized under these loans. The Company may prepay up to $5,000,000 of principal without penalty. As such, the Company exceeded the allowed $5,000,000 prepayment by approximately $203,000 and was required to make a premium payment of approximately $22,000. The loans are collateralized by approximately 5,700 of citrus groves in Collier, Hardee, Highlands and Polk Counties, Florida and mature on June 1, 2029 and June 1, 2033, respectively.\nSilver Nip Citrus entered into two additional fixed-rate term loans with Prudential to finance the acquisition of a 1,500 acre citrus grove on September 4, 2014. Each loan was in the original amount of $5,500,000 with principal of $55,000 per loan being payable quarterly, together with accrued interest. One loan bears interest at 3.85% per annum (\u201cPru Loan E\u201d), while the other bore interest at 3.45% per annum (\u201cPru Loan F\u201d). The interest rate on Pru Loan E is subject to adjustment on September 1, 2019 and every year thereafter until maturity. No adjustment was made at September 1, 2019. Both loans were collateralized by approximately 1,500 gross acres of citrus groves in Charlotte County, Florida. Pru Loan E matures September 1, 2021, and Pru Loan F was scheduled to mature September 1, 2039.\nIn November 2019, the Company prepaid Pru Loan F in full by paying the then existing principal balance of $4,455,000. As a result of this prepayment, the Company\u2019s required annual principal payments on its Pru Loans was reduced by $220,000 per annum.\nThe Silver Nip Citrus credit agreements are subject to a financial covenant whereby the consolidated current ratio requirement is 1.00 to 1.00. Silver Nip Citrus was in compliance with the current ratio covenant as of September 30, 2020.\nThe unamortized balance of deferred financing costs related to the Silver Nip Citrus debt was approximately $208,000 and $271,000 at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNote 7. Accrued Liabilities\nAccrued liabilities consist of the following at September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019:\nNote 8. Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company complies with the provisions of FASB ASC 820 \u201cFair Value Measurements\u201d for its financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis.\nASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\n\u2022\nLevel 1- Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\n\u2022\nLevel 2- Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\n\u2022\nLevel 3- Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, such as internally developed valuation models which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nAs of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have any assets held for sale that had been measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.\nManagement Security Plan\nDuring August 2020, the Company paid out a lump sum of approximately $5,175,000 to all beneficiaries in the Management Security Plan, following the equivalent annuity approach. The Company used a third-party service provider to assist in the evaluation of investments in this plan. For prior year investment valuations, the Company used current market interest rates, quality estimates by rating agencies and valuation estimates by active market participants in order to determine values. As of September 30, 2020, due to the lump sum payment made in August 2020, the deferred retirements benefit was zero. As of September 30, 2019, deferred retirement benefits were valued based on actuarial data, contracted payment schedules and an estimated discount rate of 4.08%.\nNote 9. Common Stock and Options\nEffective January 27, 2015, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors adopted the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2015 Plan\u201d) which provides for up to 1,250,000 common shares available for issuance to provide a long-term incentive plan for officers, employees, directors and/or consultants to directly link incentives to stockholder value. The 2015 Plan was approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders in February 2015. The Company\u2019s 2015 Plan provides for grants to executives in various forms including restricted shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and stock options. Awards are discretionary and are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Awards vest based upon service conditions. Non-vested restricted shares generally vest over requisite service periods of one to six years from the date of grant.\nRestricted Stock\nIn November 2017, a senior executive was awarded 5,000 restricted shares of the Company\u2019s common stock (\u201cRestricted Stock\u201d) under the 2015 Plan at a weighted average fair value of $31.95 per common share, vesting over 2.5 years.\nThe following table represents a summary of the status of the Company\u2019s nonvested shares:\nStock compensation expense related to the Restricted Stock totaled approximately $69,000, $104,000, and $137,000 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There was approximately $0 and $69,000 of total unrecognized stock compensation costs related to unvested stock compensation for the Restricted Stock grants at September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, 5,666 shares with a grant date fair value of approximately $251,000 became fully vested.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, 1,667 shares with a grant date fair value of approximately $53,000 became fully vested.\nStock Option Grant\nStock option grants of 118,000 options to certain Officers and Managers of the Company (collectively the \u201c2020 Option Grants\u201d) were granted on October 11, 2019. The option exercise price was set at $33.96, the closing price on October 11, 2019. The 2020 Option Grants will vest as follows: (i) 25% of the options will vest if the price of the Company\u2019s common stock during a consecutive 20-trading day period exceeds $35.00; (ii) 25% of the options will vest if the price of the Company\u2019s common stock during a consecutive 20-trading day period exceeds $40.00; (iii) 25% of the options will vest if the price of the Company\u2019s common stock during a consecutive 20-trading day period exceeds $45.00; and (iv) 25% of the options will vest if the price of the Company\u2019s common stock during a consecutive 20-trading day period exceeds $50.00. If the applicable stock price hurdles have not been achieved by (A) the date that is 18 months following the termination of employment, if the employment is terminated due to death or disability, (B) the date that is 12 months following the termination of employment, if the employment is terminated by the Company without cause, by the employee with good reason, or due to the employee\u2019s retirement, or (C) the date of the termination of employment for any other reason, then any unvested options will be forfeited. In addition, if the applicable stock price hurdles have not been achieved by December 31, 2022 then any unvested options will be forfeited.

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, the Company\u2019s common stock traded above $35.00 per share for twenty consecutive days. Accordingly, 25% of the 2020 Option Grants are vested at September 30, 2020 and the corresponding stock option expense was recognized during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.\nStock option grants of 10,000 options to Mr. John Kiernan (the \u201c2019 Option Grants\u201d) were granted on October 25, 2018.

As of September 30, 2020, the Company\u2019s stock was trading at $28.62 per share, and since the date of grant the Company\u2019s common stock did not trade above $60.00 per share; accordingly, none of the 2016 Option Grants are vested at September 30, 2020. As set forth below, all of the 2016 Option Grants issued to Mr. Trafelet were forfeited pursuant to the Alico Settlement Agreement, as defined below.\nAdditionally, 187,500 shares of the 2016 Option Grants made to each of Messrs. Slack and Brokaw were forfeited on September 5, 2018 and no replacement options were granted. As such, the remaining unrecognized expense associated with these options of approximately $783,000 was accelerated and recorded for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.\nPursuant to a Settlement Agreement (described in Note 14. \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d), which was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors, Mr. Trafelet agreed to voluntarily resign from his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company.

Any Retained Options that vested in accordance with their terms will expire on the date that is six months following the date on which the Retained Option vests, and any Retained Options that did not vest by the first anniversary of the Alico Settlement Agreement would be forfeited as of such first anniversary. As of September 30, 2020, the Company\u2019s stock was trading at $28.62 per share. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, the Company\u2019s common stock traded above $35.00 per share for a consecutive twenty days; accordingly, 26,250 stock options from the 2019 Modified Option Grants vested, however, since these Modified Options were not exercised within six months following the date on which the Retained Option vested, they were forfeited. Additionally, since the Company\u2019s common stock did not trade above $40.00 per share for a consecutive twenty days by the first anniversary of the date of the Alico Settlement Agreement, the other 26,250 stock options from the 2019 Modified Option Grants were forfeited.\nForfeitures of all stock options were recognized as incurred.\nThe following table represents a summary of the Company\u2019s stock option activity:\nStock compensation expense related to the options totaled approximately $504,000, $674,000 and $1,617,000 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAt September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, there was approximately $376,000 and $502,000, respectively, of total unrecognized stock compensation costs related to unvested share-based compensation for the option grants. The total unrecognized compensation cost as of September 30, 2020 is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.72 years.\nThe fair value of the 2020, 2019, and 2018 Option Grants was estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and\nrepresents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding; the range given below results from different timeframes for the various market conditions being met.\n2020 Option Grant\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of the 2020 Option Grant was $3.20.\n2019 Modified Option Grant\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of the 2019 Modified Option Grant was $1.40.\n2019 Option Grants\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of the 2019 Option Grants was $7.10.\n2018 Option Grants\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of the 2018 Option Grants was $7.40.\nAs of September 30, 2020, there remained 939,500 common shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan.\nNote 10. Treasury Stock\nIn fiscal year 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7,000,000 of the Company\u2019s common stock in two separate authorizations (collectively, the \"2017 Authorization\"). In March 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5,000,000 of the Company\u2019s common stock beginning March 9, 2017 and continuing through March 9, 2019. In May 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2,000,000 of the Company\u2019s common stock beginning May 24, 2017 and continuing through May 24, 2019. The stock repurchases made under this repurchase were made through open market transactions at times and in such amounts as the Company\u2019s broker determined subject to the provisions of SEC Rule 10b-18.\nDuring fiscal year 2018, the Company purchased 72,266 shares at a cost of $2,214,756 under the 2017 Authorization. As of June 29, 2018, the Company suspended its stock repurchase activity. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company did not purchase any shares under the 2017 Authorization. As the 2017 Authorization expired in May 2019, the Company has no funds available under this plan to repurchase stock.\nOn October 3, 2018, the Company completed a tender offer of 752,234 shares at a price of $34.00 per share aggregating $25,575,956. 734 Investors, Alico's largest stockholder from 2013 until November 12, 2019, participated in the tender offer by selling a small percentage of its holdings.\nOn October 10, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 7,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock from 734 Investors in a privately negotiated repurchase of shares. On October 15, 2019, the Company entered into a repurchase agreement to repurchase a total of 7,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock from 734 Investors, effective October 15, 2019.\nIn September 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 105,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock beginning in November 2013 and continuing through April 2018.\nThe following table illustrates the Company\u2019s treasury stock purchases for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nThe following table outlines the Company\u2019s treasury stock transactions during the past three fiscal years:\nNote 11. Income Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) was signed into law. The Act contains significant changes to corporate taxes, including a permanent reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The Company\u2019s statutory rate for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 was 24.5%, based on a fiscal year blended rate calculation. The 21% U.S. corporate tax rate is fully applicable to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 and each year thereafter.\nThe Act required a one-time remeasurement of certain tax related assets and liabilities. During the first quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company made certain estimates related to the impact of the Act including the remeasurement of deferred taxes at the new expected tax rate and a revised effective tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2018. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Company recorded a tax benefit of approximately $9,847,000 to account for these deferred tax impacts.\nIn October 2019, the Internal Revenue Service concluded their audit of the September 30, 2015 tax year with no changes. The Federal and State filings remain subject to examination by tax authorities for tax periods ending after September 30, 2015.\nThe income tax provision for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 consists of the following:\nIncome tax provision attributable to income before income taxes differed from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, 21% and 24.53% to income before income taxes for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively, as a result of the following:\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of September 30, 2020, and 2019 are presented below:\nNote 12. Segment Information\nSegments\nOperating segments are defined in the criteria established under the FASB ASC Topic 280 as components of public entities that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses for which separate financial information is available and which is evaluated regularly by the Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources. The Company\u2019s CODM assesses performance and allocates resources based on two operating segments: Alico Citrus and Land Management and Other Operations (see name change explanation below).\nAs a result of the Company selling approximately 10,700 acres on the western part of Alico Ranch to the State of Florida and because a sale of those acres affected the proposed dispersed water management project, the Company decided to suspend all permit approval activities for its dispersed water management project. This has resulted in a change in the financial reporting to the CODM. Therefore, the Company has renamed the \u201cWater Resources and Other Operations\u201d segment to \u201cLand Management and Other Operations\u201d.\nTotal revenues represent sales to unaffiliated customers, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Goods and services produced by these segments are sold to wholesalers and processors in the United States who prepare the products for consumption. The Company evaluates the segments\u2019 performance based on direct margins (gross profit) from operations before general and administrative expenses, interest expense, other income (expense) and income taxes, not including nonrecurring gains and losses.\nInformation by operating segment is as follows:\nNote 13. Employee Benefits Plans\nManagement Security Plan\nThe management security plan (\u201cMSP\u201d) was a nonqualified, noncontributory defined supplemental deferred retirement benefit plan for a select group of management personnel. The MSP was set up to provide a fixed supplemental retirement benefit for 180 months. The MSP was frozen as of September 30, 2017. As a result, no new participants were being added to the MSP and no further benefits were accumulating.\nThe MSP benefit expense and the projected management security plan benefit obligation were determined using assumptions as of the end of the respective year. The weighted-average discount rate used to compute the obligation was 4.08% in fiscal year 2019.\nActuarial gains or losses were recognized when incurred; therefore, the end of year benefit obligation was the same as the accrued benefit costs recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe amount of MSP benefit expense charged to costs and expenses was as follows:\nThe following provides a roll-forward of the MSP benefit obligation:\nEffective September 30, 2018, the Company terminated the MSP. Under the MSP termination, payout for benefits covered utilizing the applicable Internal Revenue Code regulations were not able to be commenced until at least twelve months following plan termination decision, but needed to be fully paid out within twenty-four (24) months following plan termination. During August 2020, the Company caused the MSP to pay the lump sum termination benefits of approximately $5,175,000 to all MSP beneficiaries.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company determined to pay out a lump sum under the equivalent annuity approach, whereby the payout under this approach was designed to mitigate participants tax burden. Under this approach, the Company would cover the amount needed to purchase an annuity providing the same after-tax benefit as if the plan was never terminated. As a result, the Company recorded an additional liability of approximately $720,000.\nThe Company had established a \u201cRabbi Trust\u201d to provide for the potential funding of accrued benefits under the MSP. According to the terms of the Rabbi Trust, funding was voluntary until a change of control of the Company as defined in the Management Security Plan Trust Agreement occurs. Upon a change of control, funding would be triggered. As of September 30, 2020, the Rabbi Trust had no assets, and no change of control had occurred.\nProfit Sharing and 401(k) Plans\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) employee savings plan for eligible employees, which provides up to a 4% matching contribution payable on employee payroll deferrals. The Company\u2019s matching funds vest to the employee immediately, pursuant to a safe harbor election effective in October 2012. The Company\u2019s contribution to the plan was approximately $397,000, $380,000 and $342,000 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Company also maintains a Profit Sharing Plan (\u201cPlan\u201d) that is fully funded by contributions from the Company. Contributions to the Plan are discretionary and determined annually by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. Contributions to employee accounts are based on the participant\u2019s compensation. The Company did not contribute to the Plan for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNote 14. Related Party Transactions\nClayton G. Wilson\nThe Company entered into a Separation and Consulting Agreement with Clayton G. Wilson (the \u201cSeparation and Consulting Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which Mr. Wilson stepped down as Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective as of December 31, 2016. Under the Separation and Consulting Agreement, Mr. Wilson also acknowledged and agreed that he would continue to be bound by the restrictive covenants set forth in his Employment Agreement with the Company. The Separation and Consulting Agreement provided that, subject to his execution, delivery, and non-revocation of a general release of claims in favor of the Company, Mr. Wilson would be entitled to vesting of any unvested portion of the restricted stock award granted to him under his Employment Agreement. In addition, the Separation and Consulting Agreement provided that Mr. Wilson serve as a consultant to the Company during 2017 and would receive an aggregate consulting fee of $750,000 for such services (payable $200,000 in an initial lump sum, $275,000 in a lump sum on July 1, 2017, and $275,000 in six equal monthly installments commencing July 31, 2017 and ending December 31, 2017). As of December 31, 2017, the Company satisfied its obligation to Mr. Wilson in full. The Company expensed approximately $0, $0 and $187,500 under the Separation and Consulting Agreement for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Also, on February 11, 2019, as contemplated by the Settlement Agreement, the Company entered into a consulting agreement (the \"Consulting Agreement\") with Mr. Trafelet and 3584 Inc., an entity controlled by Mr. Trafelet (the \"Consultant\"). Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, Mr. Trafelet will make himself available to provide consulting services to the Company through the Consultant for up to 24 months. In exchange for the consulting services, the Consultant will receive an annual consulting fee of $400,000. The Company recorded an expense of $800,000, representing the full amount due under the agreement, in fiscal year 2019 upon the execution of the agreement. The Company has paid approximately $400,000 and $254,000 in consulting fees for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. If the Company terminates the consulting period (other than in certain specified circumstances), the Company will continue to pay the consulting fees described above.\nShared Services Agreement\nThe Company had a shared services agreement with Trafelet Brokaw Capital Management, L.P. (\u201cTBCM\u201d), whereby the Company reimbursed TBCM for use of office space and various administrative and support services. The agreement expired December 31, 2018 and was not extended or renewed. The annual cost of the office and services was approximately $618,000. The Company expensed approximately $0, $155,000 and $592,000 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The Company\u2019s portion of the Contribution was approximately $306,000 and was funded on September 24, 2020. The remaining portion of the Contribution of $294,000 was funded by the noncontrolling parties.\nOn April 16, 2018, all operating partners of Citree received a funding notice relating to an additional Cash Capital Contribution requirement of approximately $2,041,000 as a result of Hurricane Irma, which reduced the amount of crop available for sale in the 2017/2018 harvest season and the Company\u2019s adoption of a more extensive caretaking plan focused on limiting the impact of citrus greening. The Company\u2019s portion of the Contribution was approximately $1,041,000 and was funded on April 27, 2018. The remaining portion of the Contribution of $1,000,000 was funded by the noncontrolling parties.\nDistribution of Shares by Alico\u2019s Largest Shareholder\nOn November 12, 2019, 734 Investors, the Company\u2019s largest shareholder, distributed the 3,173,405 shares of Company common stock held by it, on a pro rata basis, to its members.

Andrew Krusen and Greg Eisner, members of the Board of Directors, in the Circuit Court (the \u201cCircuit Court\u201d) for Hillsborough County, Florida (the \u201cFlorida Litigation\u201d). The Trafelet Parties sought, among other things, a declaration that (1) a purported stockholder action by written consent, delivered to the Company in the name of 734 Investors and the plaintiffs in the Florida Litigation on November 11, 2018 (the \u201cPurported Consent\u201d) was valid and binding, (2) the resolutions passed at a meeting of the Board of Directors on November 12, 2018, to, among other things, constitute an ad hoc committee of the Board of Directors to consider, evaluate and make any and all determinations, and to take any and all actions, on behalf of the Board of Directors, in connection with the Purported Consent were null and void and (3) the four defendants in the Florida Litigation were properly removed from the Board of Directors by the Purported Consent. On November 27, 2018, the Circuit Court denied without prejudice plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order and an affirmative injunction restoring Mr. Trafelet from administrative leave to active status in his capacity as President and CEO of the Company.\nOn November 28, 2018, the parties in the Florida Litigation stipulated to an order which provided, pending the resolution of the Delaware Litigation (as defined below), that (1) the record date for the Purported Consent was stayed indefinitely, and (2) Mr. Trafelet and the Company\u2019s Board of Directors should not take any action out of routine day-to-day operations conducted in the ordinary course of business, including any action to change the corporate governance of Alico or removing any corporate officers or directors from positions held as of November 27, 2018.\nOn December 6, 2018, the Trafelet Parties filed an amended complaint in the Florida Litigation which added the Company and Benjamin D. Fishman, a member of the Board of Directors, as defendants. On December 21, 2018, the Trafelet Parties filed a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction restoring Mr. Trafelet from administrative leave to active status in his capacity as President and CEO of the Company. On January 14, 2019, the defendants in the Florida Litigation filed an opposition to plaintiffs\u2019 renewed motion for a preliminary injunction. On January 18, 2019, the defendants in the Florida Litigation filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint.\nOn February 11, 2019, the parties to the Florida Litigation entered into a settlement agreement (the \u201cAlico Settlement Agreement\u201d) wherein the parties agreed to promptly dismiss all claims in the Florida Litigation. Pursuant to the Alico Settlement Agreement, Mr. Trafelet agreed to voluntarily resign as President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Board of Directors, effective upon the execution of the Alico Settlement Agreement.\nAs contemplated by the Alico Settlement Agreement, on February 11, 2019, the Company entered into a consulting agreement (the \u201cConsulting Agreement\u201d) with Mr. Trafelet and 3584 Inc., an entity controlled by Mr. Trafelet (the \u201cConsultant\u201d). Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, Mr. Trafelet agreed to make himself available to provide consulting services to the Company through the Consultant for up to 24 months. In exchange for the consulting services, the Consultant is receiving an annual consulting fee of $400,000. If the Company terminates the consulting period (other than in certain specified circumstances), the Company will continue to pay the consulting fees described in the immediately preceding sentence through the balance of the 24-month term. As such, the Company recorded the $800,000 as an expense for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.\nIn addition, on February 11, 2019, as contemplated by the Alico Settlement Agreement, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the \u201cRegistration Rights Agreement\u201d) with Mr. Trafelet, relating to the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock directly held by the Trafelet Parties as of February 11, 2019 (the \u201cRegistrable Securities\u201d). The Registration Rights Agreement required the Company to, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, use reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of the Registrable Securities. On October 10, 2019, Mr. Trafelet executed a waiver whereby he waived the S-3 Registration Rights but maintained all other rights arising under the Registration Rights Agreement and all rights arising under Section 14 of the Alico Settlement Agreement.\nDelaware Litigation\nOn November 20, 2018, members of 734 Investors filed a lawsuit against 734 Agriculture and Mr. Trafelet, who was at the time the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the \"Delaware Court\"), captioned Arlon Valencia Holdings v. Trafelet, C.A. No. 2018-0842-JTL (the \u201cMembers\u2019 Delaware Litigation\u201d). The plaintiffs sought, among other things, a declaration that (1) 734 Agriculture was validly replaced as the managing member of 734 Investors pursuant to the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of 734 Investors (the \u201cLLC Agreement\u201d) and November 19, 2018 resolution by written consent to remove 734 Agriculture as managing member of 734 Investors, and to designate Arlon Valencia Holdings, LLC as the new managing member of 734 Investors (the \u201c734 Consent\u201d), and (2) the Purported Consent was invalid under the LLC Agreement.\nAlso, on November 20, 2018, 734 Agriculture filed a lawsuit contesting the 734 Consent in the Delaware Court, captioned 734 Agriculture v. Arlon Valencia Holdings, LLC, C.A. No. 2018-0844-JTL (the \u201c734 Delaware Litigation\u201d). On November 27, 2018, the Delaware Court entered a stipulated order consolidating the Members\u2019 Delaware Litigation and the 734 Delaware Litigation into a single lawsuit, captioned In re 734 Investors, LLC Litigation, Consol. C.A. No. 2018-0844-JTL (the consolidated suit, the \u201cDelaware Litigation\u201d).\nOn December 5, 2018, the Delaware Court entered a stipulated status quo order which provided, among other things, that 734 Agriculture was to serve as the managing member of 734 Investors during the pendency of the Delaware Litigation. The status quo order also provided that 734 Agriculture would not be permitted to take any actions outside of the ordinary course of business of 734 Investors without the consent of two-thirds of the membership interests of 734 Investors, including exercising any voting rights with respect to any shares of the Company\u2019s common stock beneficially owned by 734 Investors.\nOn February 11, 2019, Mr. Trafelet, 734 Agriculture, 734 Investors, and certain members of 734 Investors entered into a settlement agreement (the \u201c734 Investors Settlement Agreement\u201d) wherein the parties agreed to promptly dismiss all claims in the Delaware Litigation. Pursuant to the 734 Investors Settlement Agreement, 734 Agriculture resigned as Managing Member of 734 Investors and Arlon Valencia Holdings, LLC was confirmed as Managing Member of 734 Investors.\nFrom time to time, Alico may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. There are no current legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or of which any of its property is subject that it believes will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nNote 16. Selected Quarterly Financial Data (unaudited)\nSummarized quarterly financial data for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, and 2019 are computed independently each quarter, therefore, the sum of the quarter amounts may not equal the total amount for the respective year due to rounding as follows:\nTotal operating expenses for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2019 includes insurance proceeds received of approximately $486,000 in additional property and casualty claims reimbursement relating to Hurricane Irma (see Note 3. \u201cInventories\u201d) and block grants of approximately $15,597,000 under the Florida Citrus Recovery Block Grant (\u201cCRBG\u201d) program relating to Hurricane Irma.

Subsequent Event\nOn December 2, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a first quarter of fiscal year 2021 cash dividend of $0.18 per share on its outstanding common stock to be paid to shareholders of record as of December 24, 2020, with payment expected on January 8, 2021.\nIn November 2020, the Company awarded 5,885 shares of restricted stock to certain officers and managers under the 2015 Plan.\nOn October 30, 2020, the Company purchased approximately 3,280 gross citrus acres located in Hendry County for a purchase price of $16.5 million.",
