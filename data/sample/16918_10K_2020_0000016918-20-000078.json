    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nIntroduction\nWe are an international producer and marketer of beer, wine, and spirits with operations in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, and Italy with powerful, consumer-connected, high-quality brands like Corona Extra, Modelo Especial, Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, and SVEDKA Vodka. In the U.S. market, we are one of the top growth contributors at retail among beverage alcohol suppliers. In the U.S. beer market, we are the third-largest beer company and leader in the high-end. We are a leading, higher-end wine and spirits company in the U.S. market. Many of our products are recognized as leaders in their respective categories. This, combined with our strong market positions, makes us a supplier of choice to many of our customers, who include wholesale distributors, retailers, and on-premise locations.\nOur mission is to build brands that people love because they are Worth Reaching For. It\u2019s worth our dedication, hard work, and the bold calculated risks we take to deliver more for our consumers, trade partners, shareholders, and communities in which we live and work. It\u2019s what has made us one of the fastest-growing large CPG companies in the U.S. at retail, and it drives our pursuit to deliver what\u2019s next.\nOur key values are:\n\u2022\npeople;\n\u2022\ncustomer focus;\n\u2022\nentrepreneurship;\n\u2022\nquality; and\n\u2022\nintegrity.\nThe Company is a Delaware corporation incorporated on December 4, 1972, as the successor to a business founded in 1945. We have approximately 9,000 employees located primarily in the U.S. and Mexico, with our corporate headquarters located in Victor, New York. We conduct our business through entities we wholly own as well as through a variety of joint ventures and other entities.\nStrategy\nOur overall strategy is to drive industry-leading growth, build unrivaled shareholder value, and shape the future of our industry by building brands that people love. We position our portfolio to benefit from the consumer-led trend toward premiumization, which we believe will continue to result in faster growth rates in the higher-end of the beer, wine, and spirits categories.\nTo capitalize on premiumization trends, become more competitive, and grow our business, we have employed a strategy dedicated to a combination of organic growth and acquisitions, with a focus on the higher-margin, higher-growth categories of the beverage alcohol industry. Key elements of our strategy include:\n\u2022\nleveraging our leading position in total beverage alcohol and our scale with wholesalers and retailers to expand distribution of our product portfolio;\n\u2022\nstrengthening relationships with wholesalers and retailers by providing consumer and beverage alcohol insights;\n\u2022\ninvesting in brand building and innovation activities;\n\u2022\npositioning ourselves for success with consumer-led products that identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics;\n\u2022\nrealizing operating efficiencies through expanding and enhancing production capabilities and maximizing asset utilization; and\n\u2022\ndeveloping employees to enhance performance in the marketplace.\nIn the beer business, we have solidified our position in the high-end of the U.S. beer market; enhanced our margins, results of operations, and operating cash flow; and provided new avenues for growth. We have made capital investments and acquisitions to increase beer production capacity to support the growth of the business. Additionally, in an effort to more fully compete in growing sectors of\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 1\nthe high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, we have leveraged our innovation capabilities to introduce new brands that align with consumer trends.\nIn our wine and spirits business, as part of our efforts to focus on higher-end brands, improve margins, and create operating efficiencies, we have acquired higher-margin, higher-growth wine brands and portfolios of brands, including Meiomi and Prisoner. We have strategically optimized the value of this business through the divestiture of the Canadian wine business and the anticipated completion of the transactions to divest a portion of our wine and spirits business, which include lower-margin, lower-growth products. In addition, we have added higher-end brands to our spirits portfolio through the acquisitions of Casa Noble tequila and High West craft whiskeys.\nWe complemented our total beverage alcohol strategy in an adjacent category by making investments in Canopy, a world-leading, diversified cannabis company. These investments are consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics, and they represent a significant expansion of our strategic relationship to position Canopy as a global leader in cannabis production, branding, intellectual property, and retailing.\nFor further information on our strategy, see Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cMD&A\u201d).\nInvestments, Acquisitions, and Divestitures\nIn connection with our strategy outlined above, during Fiscal 2020 we completed the following:\nTransaction\nDate\nStrategic Contribution\nWine and Spirits Segment\nBlack Velvet Divestiture\nNovember\nDivestiture of the lower-margin Black Velvet Canadian Whisky business and the brands associated with the production facility.\nNelson\u2019s Green Brier acquisition\nMay\nPortfolio of award-winning, Tennessee-based craft bourbon and whiskey products.\nFor further information about our significant Fiscal 2020, Fiscal 2019, and Fiscal 2018 transactions, refer to (i) MD&A and (ii) Notes 2 and 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cNotes to the Financial Statements\u201d).\nBusiness Segments\nWe report our operating results in four segments: (i) Beer, (ii) Wine and Spirits, (iii) Corporate Operations and Other, and (iv) Canopy. The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting. Amounts included below for the Canopy segment represent 100% of Canopy\u2019s reported results on a two-month lag, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and converted from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars. Although we own less than 100% of the outstanding shares of Canopy, 100% of the Canopy results are included in the information below and subsequently eliminated in order to reconcile to our consolidated financial statements.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 2\nWe report net sales in three reportable segments, as follows:\nFor the Years Ended\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\n(in millions)\nBeer\n$\n5,615.9\n$\n5,202.1\nWine and Spirits:\nWine\n2,367.5\n2,532.5\nSpirits\n360.1\n381.4\nTotal Wine and Spirits\n2,727.6\n2,913.9\nCanopy\n290.2\n48.6\nConsolidation and Eliminations\n(290.2\n)\n(48.6\n)\nConsolidated Net Sales\n$\n8,343.5\n$\n8,116.0\nConsolidated net sales are as follows:\nBeer Segment\nWe are the #1 brewer and seller of imported beer in the U.S. beer market. We are also a leader in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, which includes the imported, craft, and domestic super premium beer and alternative beverage alcohol categories. We sell a number of brands in the high-end categories, driven by our imported Mexican beer portfolio.\nWe have the exclusive right to import, market, and sell these Mexican brands in all 50 states of the U.S.:\nCorona Brand Family\nModelo Brand Family\nOther Import Brands\n\u25cf Corona Extra\n\u25cf Corona Premier\n\u25cf Corona Familiar\n\u25cf Corona Light\n\u25cf Corona Refresca\n\u25cf Corona Hard Seltzer\n\u25cf Modelo Especial\n\u25cf Modelo Negra\n\u25cf Modelo Chelada\n\u25cf Pacifico\n\u25cf Victoria\nIn the U.S., we are the leading imported beer company and have eight of the 15 top-selling imported beer brands. Modelo Especial is the best-selling imported beer, fourth best-selling beer overall, and the fastest-growing major imported beer brand in the U.S. Corona Extra is the second largest imported beer and seventh best-selling beer overall in the U.S.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 3\nSince the June 2013 acquisition of the imported beer business, we have more than tripled our production capacity in Mexico from 10 million to approximately 34 million hectoliters. Our current production capacity provides us the opportunity to further expand our leadership position in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market by increasing our investment behind on-trend innovation. As part of these efforts, in Fiscal 2019 we successfully introduced Corona Premier, a lower-calorie, lower-carbohydrate product offering, which has become one of the top growth contributors in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market. During Fiscal 2020, we launched Corona Refresca and in early Fiscal 2021 we launched Corona Hard Seltzer. The national launches of Corona Refresca and Corona Hard Seltzer are part of efforts to capitalize on the growth of the high-end alternative beverage alcohol category. Additionally, we are continuing efforts focused on increasing sales distribution of products in can, draft, single-serve, and larger package size formats.\nExpansion and construction efforts continue under our Mexico Beer Expansion Projects. Since the June 2013 acquisition of the imported beer business, we have invested approximately $4 billion for the Mexico Beer Expansion Projects, with approximately $520 million during Fiscal 2020. To align with our anticipated future growth expectations, we are targeting an additional five million hectoliters of production capacity expansion activities to be completed at the Obregon Brewery and we are exploring options to add further capacity in Mexico to meet our long-term needs.\nIn March 2020, we sold the Ballast Point craft beer business, including a number of its associated production facilities and brewpubs. This divestiture is consistent with our strategic focus on our high-performing import portfolio and upcoming new product introductions. For additional information regarding the Ballast Point Transaction, refer to \u201cRecent Developments\u201d in MD&A and Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nWine and Spirits Segment\nWe are a leading, higher-end wine and spirits company in the U.S. market, with a portfolio that includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine and spirits brands. Our wine portfolio is supported by grapes purchased from independent growers, primarily in the U.S., New Zealand, and Chile, and vineyard holdings in the U.S., New Zealand, and Italy. Our wine produced in the U.S., New Zealand, and Italy is primarily marketed in the U.S. In addition, we export our wine products to Canada and other major world markets. Our spirits offerings include SVEDKA Vodka, which is imported from Sweden and is the largest imported vodka brand in the U.S. Our higher-end spirits brands include Casa Noble tequila and High West craft whiskeys.\nIn the U.S., we have 16 of the 100 top-selling wine brands. Some of our well-known wine and spirits brands and portfolio of brands, sold in the U.S., which comprised our Fiscal 2020 U.S. Power Brands (\u201cPower Brands\u201d), included:\nWine Brands\nWine Portfolio\nof Brands\nSpirits Brands\n\u25cf 7 Moons\n\u25cf Drylands\n\u25cf SIMI\n\u25cf Charles Smith\n\u25cf Casa Noble\n\u25cf Auros\n\u25cf Kim Crawford\n\u25cf Spoken Barrel\n\u25cf Prisoner\n\u25cf High West\n\u25cf Champagne Palmer & Co\n\u25cf Meiomi\n\u25cf Robert Mondavi\n\u25cf Mi CAMPO\n\u25cf Cooper & Thief\n\u25cf Mount Veeder\n\u25cf Schrader\n\u25cf Nelson\u2019s Green Brier\n\u25cf Crafters Union\n\u25cf Nobilo (1)\n\u25cf SVEDKA\n\u25cf Cuv\u00e9e Sauvage\n\u25cf Ruffino\n\u25cf The Real McCoy\n(1)\nSee \u201cRecent Developments\u201d in MD&A and Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nWe dedicate a large share of sales and marketing resources to our Power Brands as they represent a majority of our U.S. wine and spirits revenue and profitability, and generally hold strong positions in their respective price categories.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 4\nWe have been increasing resources in support of on-trend product innovation as we believe this is one of the key drivers of overall beverage alcohol category growth. In wine, we have launched varietal line extensions behind many of our Power Brands, such as Bourbon Barrel Aged Robert Mondavi Private Selection and Meiomi Ros\u00e9, and we have introduced newer brands like Derange, Spoken Barrel, Cooper & Thief, and Crafters Union wine in a can. In spirits, we have introduced Mi CAMPO tequila.\nIn connection with our efforts to increase focus on higher-margin, higher-growth brands, in April 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business, including approximately 30 lower-margin, lower-growth wine and spirits brands, wineries, vineyards, offices, and facilities.\nIn December 2019, we agreed to revise and supersede the Wine and Spirits Transaction. The revisions to the transaction address competitive concerns raised by the FTC specifically related to the sparkling wine, brandy, dessert wine, and concentrate categories. As a result, the brands Cook\u2019s California Champagne, J. Roget American Champagne, Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy, and our concentrate business will be excluded from the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction. The Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction is expected to close around the end of first quarter of fiscal 2021, and is subject to required regulatory clearances and governmental review and approval. Additionally, in a separate, but related, transaction, we agreed that upon execution and delivery of a definitive agreement for the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction, we would enter into the Nobilo Wine Transaction. The Nobilo Wine Transaction is expected to close by the end of second quarter of fiscal 2021 and is subject to FTC and New Zealand regulatory review and approval. Completion of the Nobilo Transaction is also conditioned on completion of the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction.\nWe are pursuing other opportunities to divest the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy brand and concentrate business excluded from the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction to companies with more aligned business strategies.\nFor further information about these transactions, refer to \u201cRecent Developments\u201d in MD&A and Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nCorporate Operations and Other\nThe Corporate Operations and Other segment includes traditional corporate-related items including costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate growth and strategy, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations, and information technology, as well as our investments made through our corporate venture capital function.\nFurther information regarding net sales and operating income (loss) of each of our business segments and information regarding geographic areas is set forth in Note 23 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nMarketing and Distribution\nTo focus on their respective product categories, build brand equity, and increase sales, our segments employ full-time, in-house marketing, sales, and customer service functions. These functions engage in a range of marketing activities and strategies, including market research, consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale materials, event sponsorship, on-premise promotions, and public relations. Where opportunities exist, particularly with national accounts in the U.S., we leverage our sales and marketing skills across the organization.\nIn the U.S., our products are primarily distributed by wholesale distributors, with generally separate distribution networks utilized for (i) our beer portfolio and (ii) our wine and spirits portfolio, as well as state alcohol beverage control agencies. As is the case with all other beverage alcohol companies, products sold through these agencies are subject to obtaining and maintaining listings to sell our products in that agency\u2019s state. State governments can affect prices paid by consumers of our products\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 5\nthrough the imposition of taxes or, in states in which the government acts as the distributor of our products through an alcohol beverage control agency, by directly setting the retail prices.\nTrademarks and Distribution Agreements\nTrademarks are an important aspect of our business. We sell products under a number of trademarks, which we own or use under license. Throughout our segments, we also have various licenses and distribution agreements for the sale, or the production and sale, of our products, and products of third parties. These licenses and distribution agreements have varying terms and durations.\nWithin the Beer segment, we have an exclusive sub-license to use trademarks related to our Mexican beer brands in the U.S. This sub-license agreement is perpetual. Prior to our June 2013 acquisition of the imported beer business, Crown Imports had exclusive importation agreements with the suppliers of certain imported beer products and had an exclusive renewable sub-license to use certain trademarks related to the imported beer brands in the U.S.\nCompetition\nThe beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. We compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition, and distribution strength. Our beverage alcohol products compete with other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail stores, restaurant presence, and wholesaler attention. We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, some of which have greater resources than we do. Our principal competitors include:\nBeer\nAnheuser-Busch InBev, Molson Coors, Heineken, The Boston Beer Company, Mark Anthony\nWine\nE. & J. Gallo Winery, The Wine Group, Trinchero Family Estates, Treasury Wine Estates, Ste. Michelle Wine Estates, Deutsch Family Wine & Spirits\nSpirits\nDiageo, Beam Suntory, Brown-Forman, Sazerac Company, Pernod Ricard\nThe Canopy Equity Method Investment makes up the Canopy segment. Canopy operates in the recreational and medicinal cannabis market and they compete with numerous producers and distributors of cannabis products. Canopy\u2019s principal competitors include:\nCanopy\nCronos Group, Aurora Cannabis, Aphria, Tilray\nProduction\nOur current production capacity in Mexico at our Nava and Obregon breweries is approximately 34 million hectoliters. We are expanding the Obregon Brewery by an incremental five million hectoliters, and based on our anticipated future growth expectations, we intend to expand our production capacity in Mexico to approximately 44 million hectoliters in the future.\nOur Daleville facility, located in Roanoke, Virginia, supports our craft and specialty business in addition to our domestic innovation initiatives.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 6\nIn the U.S., we operate 17 wineries using many varieties of grapes grown principally in the Napa, Sonoma, Monterey, and San Joaquin regions of California. We also operate three wineries in New Zealand and six wineries in Italy. Grapes are crushed at most of our wineries and stored as wine until packaged for sale under our brand names or sold in bulk. The inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels during and after the crush of each year\u2019s grape harvest and are reduced prior to the subsequent year\u2019s crush. Wine inventories are usually at their highest levels in September through November in the U.S. and Italy, and in March through May in New Zealand.\nWe currently operate three facilities in the U.S. for the production of our High West whiskey brand. The requirements for grains and bulk spirits used in the production of our spirits are purchased from various suppliers.\nCertain of our wines and spirits must be aged for multiple years. Therefore, our inventories of wines and spirits may be larger in relation to sales and total assets than in many other businesses.\nSources and Availability of Production Materials\nThe principal components in the production of our Mexican and craft beer brands include water; agricultural products, such as yeast and grains; and packaging materials, which include glass, aluminum, and cardboard.\nFor our Mexican beer brands, packaging materials represent the largest cost component of production, with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials.\nFor Fiscal 2020, the package format mix of our Mexican beer volume sold in the U.S. was as follows:\nThe Nava and Obregon breweries receive water originating from aquifers. We believe we have adequate access to water to support the breweries\u2019 on-going requirements, as well as future requirements after the completion of planned expansion activities.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 7\nAs part of our efforts to solidify our beer glass sourcing strategy over the long-term, we formed an equally-owned joint venture with Owens-Illinois, the world\u2019s largest glass container manufacturer. In December 2014, the joint venture acquired a state-of-the-art glass production plant that is located adjacent to our Nava Brewery in Mexico. The glass plant currently has five operational glass furnaces which supply approximately 55% of the total annual glass bottle supply for our Mexican beer brands. We also have long-term glass supply agreements with other glass producers.\nThe principal components in the production of our wine and spirits products are agricultural products, such as grapes and grain, and packaging materials, primarily glass.\nMost of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by grower purchases from each year\u2019s harvest which normally begins in August and runs through October in the U.S. and Italy, and begins in February and runs through May in New Zealand. We receive grapes from approximately 720 independent growers in the U.S. and approximately 195 independent growers located primarily in New Zealand and Chile. We enter into purchase agreements with a majority of these growers with pricing that generally varies year-to-year and is largely based on then-current market prices.\nAs of February 29, 2020, we owned or leased approximately 19,700 acres of land and vineyards, either fully bearing or under development, in the U.S., New Zealand, and Italy. This acreage supplies only a small percentage of our overall total grape needs for wine production. However, most of this acreage is used to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of certain of our higher-end wines. We continue to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards, and additional land for vineyard plantings, to supplement our grape supply.\nWe believe that we have adequate sources of grape supplies to meet our sales expectations. However, when demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations, we look to source the extra requirements from the bulk wine markets around the world.\nThe distilled spirits manufactured and imported by us require various agricultural products, neutral grain spirits, and bulk spirits, which we fulfill through purchases from various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open market. We believe that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present time.\nWe utilize glass and polyethylene terephthalate (\u201cPET\u201d) bottles and other materials such as caps, corks, capsules, labels, wine bags, and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our wine and spirits products. After grape purchases, glass bottle costs are the largest component of our cost of product sold. In the U.S., the glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers. We have traditionally obtained, and continue to obtain, our glass requirements from a limited number of producers under long-term supply arrangements. Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations. We have been able to satisfy our requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider our sources of supply to be adequate at this time.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a range of laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Where we produce products, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, and may be required to obtain environmental and alcohol beverage permits and licenses to operate our facilities. Where we market and sell products, we may be subject to laws and regulations on brand registration, packaging and labeling, distribution methods and relationships, pricing and price changes, sales promotions, advertising, and public relations. We are also subject to rules and regulations relating to changes in officers or directors, ownership, or control.\nWe believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. We also believe that the cost of administration and\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 8\ncompliance with, and liability under, such laws and regulations does not have, and is not expected to have, a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nSeasonality\nThe beverage alcohol industry is subject to seasonality in each major category. As a result, in response to wholesaler and retailer demand which precedes consumer purchases, our beer sales are typically highest during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year, which correspond to the Spring and Summer periods in the U.S. Our wine and spirits Power Brand sales are typically highest during the third quarter of our fiscal year, primarily due to seasonal holiday buying.\nEmployees\nAs of March 31, 2020, we had approximately 9,000 employees. We may employ additional workers during the grape crushing seasons. Approximately 17% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements expiring within one year are minimal. We consider our employee relations generally to be good.\nEmployee geographic data is as follows:\nFollowing the close of the anticipated Revised Wine and Spirits Transactions we are estimating a reduction of approximately 700 employees.\nExecutive Officers of the Company\nInformation with respect to our current executive officers is as follows:\nNAME\nAGE\nOFFICE OR POSITION HELD\nWilliam A.

This section identifies those accounting policies that are considered important to our results of operations and financial condition, require significant judgment and involve significant management estimates. Our significant accounting policies, including those considered to be critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an international beverage alcohol company with a broad portfolio of consumer-preferred high-end imported beer brands, and higher-end wine and spirits brands. Many of our products are recognized as leaders in their respective categories. We are one of the leading U.S. growth drivers at retail among beverage alcohol suppliers. In the U.S. market, we are the third-largest beer company and a leading higher-end wine company.\nThrough February 28, 2019, our internal management financial reporting consisted of two business divisions: (i) Beer and (ii) Wine and Spirits. Beginning March 1, 2019, as a result of our November 2018 Canopy Investment and a change in our CODM on March 1, 2019, we have changed our internal management financial reporting to consist of three business divisions: (i) Beer, (ii) Wine and Spirits, and (iii) Canopy. Consequently, beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we report our operating results in four segments: (i) Beer, (ii) Wine and Spirits, (iii) Corporate Operations and Other, and (iv) Canopy. Our Canopy Equity Method Investment makes up the Canopy segment.\nIn the Beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported and craft beer and alternative beverage alcohol brands. We have an exclusive perpetual brand license to import, market, and sell our\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 31\nMexican beer portfolio in the U.S. In the Wine and Spirits segment, our portfolio includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine brands complemented by certain higher-end spirits brands. Amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate growth and strategy, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations, and information technology, as well as our investments made through our corporate venture capital function. All costs included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are therefore not allocated to the other reportable segments. All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in our CODM\u2019s evaluation of the operating income (loss) performance of the other reportable segments. The new business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting.\nSTRATEGY\nOur overall strategy is to drive industry-leading growth, build unrivaled shareholder value, and shape the future of our industry by building brands that people love. We believe sharing a toast, unwinding after a day, celebrating milestones, and helping people connect, is Worth Reaching For. We position our portfolio to benefit from the consumer-led trend towards premiumization, which we believe will continue to result in faster growth rates in the higher-end of the beer, wine, and spirits categories. We focus on developing our expertise in consumer insights and category management, as well as our strong distributor network, which provides an effective route-to-market. Additionally, we leverage our scale across the total beverage alcohol market and our level of diversification hedges our portfolio risk. In addition to growing our existing business, we focus on targeted acquisitions of, and investments in, businesses that are higher-margin, higher-growth, consumer-led, have a low integration risk, and/or fill a gap in our portfolio. We also strive to identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics (see \u201cInvestments, Acquisitions, and Divestitures - Canopy Investments\u201d below).\nWe strive to strengthen our portfolio of higher-end beer, wine, and spirits brands and differentiate ourselves through:\n\u2022\nleveraging our leading position in total beverage alcohol and our scale with wholesalers and retailers to expand distribution of our product portfolio;\n\u2022\nstrengthening relationships with wholesalers and retailers by providing consumer and beverage alcohol insights;\n\u2022\ninvesting in brand building and innovation activities;\n\u2022\npositioning ourselves for success with consumer-led products that identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics;\n\u2022\nrealizing operating efficiencies through expanding and enhancing production capabilities and maximizing asset utilization; and\n\u2022\ndeveloping employees to enhance performance in the marketplace.\nOur business strategy for the Beer segment focuses on leading the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market and includes continued focus on growing our beer portfolio in the U.S. through expanding distribution for key brands, as well as new product development and innovation within the existing portfolio of brands, and continued expansion, construction, and optimization activities for our Mexico beer operations. Additionally, in an effort to more fully compete in growing sectors of the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, we have leveraged our innovation capabilities to introduce new brands that align with consumer trends. We continue to refine our options to optimize the value of our Beer segment and drive increased focus on our high-performing import portfolio and upcoming new product introductions. See \u201cRecent Developments - Ballast Point Transaction\u201d below.\nIn connection with our business strategy for the Beer segment, we have more than tripled the production capacity of our brewery located in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico since its June 2013 acquisition.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 32\nAdditionally, we are continuing to invest to expand our brewery operations in Obregon, Sonora, Mexico, where expansion is expected to be completed by the end of Fiscal 2021, although containment actions associated with COVID-19 may alter that timeline. See \u201cCapital Expenditures\u201d below for discussion of a recent public consultation on construction of a new brewery in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico. Expansion, construction, and optimization efforts continue under our previously-announced Mexico Beer Expansion Projects (as defined below in \u201cCapital Expenditures\u201d) to align with our anticipated future growth expectations (see \u201cCapital Expenditures\u201d below).\nOur business strategy for the Wine and Spirits segment is to build an industry-leading portfolio of higher-end wine and spirits brands. We are investing to meet the evolving needs of consumers; building brands through consumer insights, sensory expertise, and innovation; and refreshing existing brands, as we continue to focus on moving our branded wine and spirits portfolio towards a higher-margin, higher-growth portfolio of brands. We dedicate a large share of our sales and marketing resources to well-known wine and spirits brands sold in the U.S., which comprise the U.S. Power Brands as they represent a majority of our U.S. wine and spirits revenue and profitability, and generally hold strong positions in their respective price categories. We focus our innovation and investment dollars on those brands within our portfolio which position us to benefit from the consumer-led trend towards premiumization. Additionally, in connection with the New Wine and Spirits Transactions, Other Wine and Spirits Transactions, and the Black Velvet Divestiture, we expect to optimize the value of our wine and spirits portfolio by driving increased focus on our higher-end Power Brands to accelerate growth and improve overall operating margins. In markets where it is feasible, we entered into contractual arrangements to consolidate our U.S. distribution network in order to obtain dedicated distributor selling resources which focus on our U.S. wine and spirits portfolio to drive organic growth. This consolidated U.S. distribution network currently represents about 70% of our branded wine and spirits volume in the U.S. Throughout the terms of these contracts, we generally expect shipments on an annual basis to these distributors to essentially equal the distributors\u2019 shipments to retailers.\nMarketing, sales, and distribution of our products are managed on a geographic basis in order to fully leverage leading market positions. In addition, market dynamics and consumer trends vary across each of our markets. Within our primary market in the U.S., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, craft beer, branded wine, and spirits categories, with generally separate distribution networks utilized for (i) our beer portfolio and (ii) our wine and spirits portfolio. The environment for our products is competitive in each of our markets.\nWe complemented our total beverage alcohol strategy in an adjacent category by making investments in Canopy, a world-leading, diversified cannabis company. These investments are consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics, and they represent a significant expansion of our strategic relationship to position Canopy as a global leader in cannabis production, branding, intellectual property, and retailing.\nWe remain committed to our long-term financial model of: growing sales, expanding margins, and increasing cash flow in order to achieve earnings per share growth, maintain our targeted leverage ratio, and deliver returns to shareholders through the payment of quarterly cash dividends and periodic share repurchases.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19\nWe have an existing Crisis Management Committee that has been closely monitoring the impact of the novel strain of a virus, COVID-19, on our Company and our workforce since January 2020. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) recognized COVID-19 as a pandemic. COVID-19 has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world. In response to COVID-19, the governments of many countries, states, cities, and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations and advising or requiring individuals to\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 33\nlimit or forgo their time outside of their homes. Temporary closures of businesses have been ordered and numerous other businesses have temporarily closed voluntarily. Further, individuals' ability to travel has been curtailed through mandated travel restrictions and may be further limited through additional voluntary or mandated closures of travel-related businesses. In most of our locations, the beverage alcohol industry has been classified as an essential business and as such we are still able to produce and sell our products. COVID-19 has affected us primarily in the reduction of depletion volume on our products in the on-premise business due to shelter in place mandates and bar and restaurant closures. The on-premise business has historically been about 10% to 15% of our depletion volume for beer, wine, and spirits.\nCurrently, our major breweries, wineries, and bottling facilities are still operating but, in some instances, at lower production levels than planned. We have closed all hospitality, tasting rooms, retail, restaurants, and other non-essential public facilities. However, our supply chains and distribution channels have not been materially impacted and we have adequate supply of products to meet forecasted demand. The March 2020 closure of the U.S. and Mexico border to non-essential travel does not impact the movement of commercial products including the products we manufacture in Mexico and import to the U.S.\nWe have implemented various measures to reduce the spread of the virus including working from home, restricting visitors to our production locations, splitting our production workforces, reducing the on-site production workforce levels, screening workers before they enter facilities, implementing social distancing, and encouraging employees to adhere to prevention measures recommended by the Center for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d) and the WHO. Since our non-production workforce is able to work remotely using various technology tools, we are able to maintain our operations and internal controls over financial reporting and disclosures.\nAt this time, we are not able to estimate the long-term impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flow. We believe we have sufficient liquidity available from operating cash flow, cash on hand, and availability under our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. We expect to have continued access to capital markets and to continue to return value to shareholders.\nNew Wine and Spirits Transactions\nIn April 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement with E. & J. Gallo Winery (\u201cGallo\u201d) to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business, including approximately 30 lower-margin, lower-growth wine and spirits brands, wineries, vineyards, offices, and facilities.\nIn December 2019, we agreed to revise and supersede the Wine and Spirits Transaction. The revisions to the transaction address competitive concerns raised by the FTC specifically related to the sparkling wine, brandy, dessert wine, and concentrate categories. As a result, the brands Cook\u2019s California Champagne, J. Roget American Champagne, Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy, and our concentrate business will be excluded from the transaction with Gallo resulting in an adjusted transaction price of approximately $843 million, with the potential to earn an incremental $250 million of contingent consideration if certain brand performance provisions are met over a two-year period after closing. The Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction is expected to close around the end of first quarter of fiscal 2021, and is subject to required regulatory clearances and governmental review and approval. Additionally, in a separate, but related, transaction we agreed that upon execution and delivery of a definitive agreement for the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction, we would enter into an agreement to sell the New Zealand-based Nobilo Wine brand and certain related assets for $130 million to Gallo. The Nobilo Wine Transaction is expected to close by the end of second quarter of fiscal 2021 and is subject to FTC and New Zealand regulatory review and approval. Completion of the Nobilo Transaction is also conditioned on completion of the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction. We expect to use the net cash proceeds from the New Wine and Spirits Transactions primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings. The New Wine and Spirits Transactions are consistent with our strategic focus on higher-margin, higher-growth brands.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 34\nWe have communicated our intent to retain the brands Cook\u2019s California Champagne and J. Roget American Champagne contemplated under the Wine and Spirits Transaction and the FTC is currently reviewing our business plans to support these brands in the future.\nOther Wine and Spirits Transactions\nWe are pursuing other opportunities to divest the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy brand and concentrate business excluded from the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction to companies with more aligned business strategies.\nIn connection with the New Wine and Spirits Transactions and the Other Wine and Spirits Transactions, we have wine and spirits net assets of $1,072.4 million that have met the held for sale criteria as of February 29, 2020.\nSelected financial information included in our results of operations for the portion of the business that we expect will no longer be part of our consolidated results after the closing of the New Wine and Spirits Transactions and Other Wine and Spirits Transactions is as follows:\nNet Sales\nGross Profit\nMarketing (1)\n(in millions)\nFiscal 2020\nWine and Spirits segment results\n$\n$\n$\n(1)\nThis expense is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated results of operations.\nFor additional information regarding the New Wine and Spirits Transactions and the Other Wine and Spirits Transactions, refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nBallast Point Transaction\nIn March 2020, we sold the Ballast Point craft beer business, including a number of its associated production facilities and brewpubs. This divestiture is consistent with our strategic focus on our high-performing import portfolio and upcoming new product introductions. For additional information regarding the Ballast Point Transaction, refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nPrimarily in connection with the Ballast Point Transaction, we have beer net assets of $45.3 million that met the held for sale criteria as of February 29, 2020.\nCanopy production optimization\nIn March 2020, Canopy announced its plans to close two Canadian greenhouse facilities as part of its efforts to align supply and demand while improving production efficiencies over time. In April 2020, Canopy announced its plans to close an additional Canadian greenhouse facility, exit its operations in Africa, and reduce Latin America and United States cultivation activities. Canopy expects to record an estimated pre-tax loss of approximately C$700 million to C$800 million in their fourth quarter fiscal 2020 results from the facilities closures as well as other changes related to its organizational and strategic review. We will record our proportional share of Canopy\u2019s estimated pre-tax loss of approximately C$245 million to C$280 million, in our first quarter fiscal 2021 results.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 35\nInvestments, Acquisitions, and Divestitures\nCanopy Segment\nCanopy Investments\nOur investments in Canopy, and the method of accounting for these investments, consist of the following:\nDate of\nInvestment\nInvestment\nAcquired\nPurchase\nPrice\nMethod of\nAccounting\n(in millions)\nNov 2017\nCommon shares\n$\n130.1\nFair value / equity method (1)\nNov 2017\nWarrants\n61.2\nFair value\n$\n191.3\nJune 2018\nConvertible debt securities\n$\n150.5\nFair value\nNov 2018\nCommon shares\n$\n2,740.3\nEquity method\nNov 2018\nWarrants (3)\n1,146.8\nFair value\n$\n3,887.1\n(2)\nWe recognized an unrealized net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of these investments accounted for at fair value in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments, as follows:\nDate of\nInvestment\nInvestment\nFiscal 2020\nFiscal 2019\n(in millions)\nNov 2017\nCommon shares (1)\n$\n-\n$\n292.5\nNov 2017\nWarrants\n(543.7\n)\n465.5\nJune 2018\nConvertible debt securities\n(94.6\n)\n55.5\nNov 2018\nWarrants (3)\n(1,488.1\n)\n1,157.7\n$\n(2,126.4\n)\n$\n1,971.2\n(1)\nAccounted for at fair value from the date of investment in November 2017 through October 31, 2018. Accounted for under the equity method from November 1, 2018 (see Note 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements).\n(2)\nIncludes $17.2 million of direct acquisition costs capitalized under the equity method cost accumulation model. Excludes $7.3 million of direct acquisition costs associated with the investment in warrants which are expensed as incurred in selling, general, and administrative expenses.\n(3)\nIn June 2019, the Canopy Shareholders approved the modification of the terms of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants. For additional information refer to Note 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. Fiscal 2020 includes a $1,176.0 million unrealized gain resulting from the June 2019 Warrant Modification.\nWe expect the value of the Canopy investments accounted for at fair value to be volatile in future periods. We evaluated the Canopy investments as of February 29, 2020, and determined that there was not an other-than-temporary-impairment. Additionally, since November 1, 2018, we recognize equity in earnings (losses) and related activities for our Canopy Equity Method Investment on a two-month lag. Accordingly, we recognized our share of Canopy\u2019s earnings (losses) from January through December 2019, in our Fiscal 2020 results. We recognized our share of Canopy\u2019s losses from November and December 2018, in our Fiscal 2019 results. We expect Canopy\u2019s earnings to be volatile in future periods.\nAs of February 29, 2020, the conversion of Canopy equity securities held by its employees and/or held by other third parties, excluding our November 2017 Canopy Warrants, New November 2018 Canopy Warrants, Canopy Debt Securities, and the Acreage Call Option, would not have a significant effect on our share of Canopy\u2019s reported earnings or losses. Additionally, under an amended and restated investor\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 36\nrights agreement, we have the option to purchase additional common shares of Canopy at the then-current price of the underlying equity security to allow us to maintain our relative ownership interest. If we exercised all of our outstanding November 2017 Canopy Warrants and New November 2018 Canopy Warrants, it could have a significant effect on our share of Canopy\u2019s reported earnings or losses and our ownership interest in Canopy would be expected to increase to greater than 50 percent. In connection with the Acreage Transaction, Canopy has the Acreage Call Option, which would require the issuance of Canopy shares. If Canopy exercised the Acreage Call Option it could have a significant effect on our share of Canopy\u2019s reported earnings or losses and our ownership interest in Canopy would decrease and no longer be expected to be greater than 50 percent.\nAs previously noted, these investments are consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics, and they represent a significant expansion of our strategic relationship to position Canopy as a global leader in cannabis production, branding, intellectual property, and retailing.\nBeer Segment\nFour Corners acquisition\nIn July 2018, we acquired Four Corners, which primarily included the acquisition of operations, goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, and trademarks. This acquisition included a portfolio of high-quality, dynamic, and bicultural, Texas-based craft beers which further strengthened our position in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market. The results of operations of Four Corners are reported in the Beer segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.\nWine and Spirits Segment\nBlack Velvet Divestiture\nOn November 1, 2019, we sold the Black Velvet Canadian Whisky business and the brand\u2019s associated production facility, along with a subset of Canadian whisky brands produced at that facility, and related inventory at a transaction value of $266.3 million. Accordingly, our consolidated results of operations include the results of operations of our Canadian whisky business through the date of divestiture. We received cash proceeds of $269.7 million, subject to estimated working capital adjustments. This divestiture is consistent with our strategic focus on higher-margin, higher-growth brands. We recognized a net gain of $74.1 million on the sale of the business for the year ended February 29, 2020.\nNelson\u2019s Green Brier acquisition\nIn May 2019, we increased our ownership interest in Nelson\u2019s Green Brier to 75%, resulting in consolidation of the business and recognition of a 25% noncontrolling interest. This acquisition included a portfolio of award-winning, Tennessee-based craft bourbon and whiskey products. The preliminary fair value of the business combination was allocated primarily to goodwill, trademarks, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment. The results of operations of Nelson\u2019s Green Brier are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.\nSale of Accolade Wine Investment\nIn May 2018, we completed the sale of our remaining interest in our previously-owned Australian and European business for A$149.1 million, or $113.6 million. We received cash proceeds, net of direct costs to sell, of $111.7 million. This interest consisted of an investment accounted for under the cost method and AFS debt securities. We recognized net gains of $0.4 million and $99.8 million in connection with this transaction for the years ended February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, respectively. These net gains are included in income from unconsolidated investments.\nFor additional information on these recent developments, investments, acquisitions, and divestitures refer to Notes 2, 7, and 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 37\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nReferences to organic throughout the following discussion exclude the impact of divested brand activity in connection with the Black Velvet Divestiture (wine and spirits), as appropriate.\nFinancial Highlights for Fiscal 2020:\n\u2022\nOur results of operations were negatively impacted by (i) an unrealized net loss from the changes in fair value of our investments in Canopy, (ii) equity in losses from Canopy\u2019s results of operations and related activities, and (iii) an impairment of long-lived assets held for sale primarily in connection with the New Wine and Spirits Transactions, partially offset by (i) an unrealized gain resulting from the June 2019 modification of the terms of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants and (ii) the continued improvements within the Beer segment.\n\u2022\nNet sales increased 3% primarily due to an increase in Beer net sales driven predominantly by volume growth and a favorable impact from pricing within our Mexican beer portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in Wine and Spirits net sales led by branded volume decline largely from brands to be divested.\n\u2022\nOperating income (loss) decreased 11% largely due to an impairment of long-lived assets held for sale primarily in connection with the New Wine and Spirits Transactions and restructuring and other strategic business development costs incurred in connection with ongoing efforts to gain efficiencies and reduce our cost structure primarily within the Wine and Spirits segment, partially offset by the net sales volume growth and favorable impact from pricing within our Mexican beer portfolio and a net gain related to the Black Velvet Divestiture.\n\u2022\nNet income (loss) attributable to CBI and diluted net income (loss) per common share attributable to CBI decreased significantly primarily due to an unrealized net loss on our investments in Canopy for Fiscal 2020, as compared with an unrealized net gain from the changes in fair value on our investments for Fiscal 2019, partially offset by a net income tax benefit recognized as a result of tax reform enacted in Switzerland.\nCOMPARABLE ADJUSTMENTS\nManagement excludes items that affect comparability from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these Comparable Adjustments are not reflective of core operations of the segments. Segment operating performance and segment management compensation are evaluated based on core segment operating income (loss). As such, the performance measures for incentive compensation purposes for segment management do not include the impact of these Comparable Adjustments.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 38\nAs more fully described herein and in the related Notes to the Financial Statements, the Comparable Adjustments that impacted comparability in our segment results for each period are as follows:\nFiscal 2020\nFiscal 2019\n(in millions)\nCost of product sold\nStrategic business development costs\n$\n(124.5\n)\n$\n(6.0\n)\nNet gain (loss) on undesignated commodity derivative contracts\n(49.0\n)\n1.8\nAccelerated depreciation\n(7.6\n)\n(8.9\n)\nFlow through of inventory step-up\n(1.5\n)\n(4.9\n)\nSettlements of undesignated commodity derivative contracts\n11.7\n(8.6\n)\nRecovery of (loss on) inventory write-down\n8.6\n(3.3\n)\nTotal cost of product sold\n(162.3\n)\n(29.9\n)\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nRestructuring and other strategic business development costs\n(25.3\n)\n(17.1\n)\nImpairment of intangible assets\n(11.0\n)\n(108.0\n)\nTransaction, integration, and other acquisition-related costs\n(9.2\n)\n(10.2\n)\nNet gain (loss) on foreign currency derivative contracts associated with acquisition of investment\n-\n(32.6\n)\nDeferred compensation\n-\n(16.3\n)\nOther gains (losses)\n5.5\n10.1\nTotal selling, general, and administrative expenses\n(40.0\n)\n(174.1\n)\nImpairment of assets held for sale\n(449.7\n)\n-\nGain (loss) on sale of business\n74.1\n-\nComparable Adjustments, Operating income (loss)\n$\n(577.9\n)\n$\n(204.0\n)\nIncome (loss) from unconsolidated investments\n$\n(2,480.1\n)\n$\n2,084.9\nCost of Product Sold\nStrategic Business Development Costs\nWe recognized costs primarily in connection with losses on write-downs of excess inventory, bulk wine sales, and contract terminations resulting from our ongoing efforts to optimize our portfolio, gain efficiencies, and reduce our cost structure within the Wine and Spirits segment.\nUndesignated Commodity Derivative Contracts\nNet gain (loss) on undesignated commodity derivative contracts represents a net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of undesignated commodity derivative contracts. The net gain (loss) is reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is recognized in the segment operating results. At settlement, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the undesignated commodity derivative contracts is reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing the results of our operating segments to reflect the economic effects of the commodity derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.\nAccelerated Depreciation\nWe recognized accelerated depreciation for certain assets primarily in connection with our current multi-year implementation of a new ERP system which is intended to replace our existing operating and financial systems.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 39\nInventory Step-Up\nIn connection with acquisitions, the allocation of purchase price in excess of book value for certain inventories on hand at the date of acquisition is referred to as inventory step-up. Inventory step-up represents an assumed manufacturing profit attributable to the acquired business prior to acquisition.\nRecovery of (Loss on) Inventory Write-Down\nWe recognized a reimbursement from our insurance carriers for losses recognized on the write-down of certain bulk wine inventory as a result of smoke damage sustained during the Fall 2017 California wildfires (Fiscal 2020). We recognized a loss on the write-down of certain bulk wine inventory as a result of smoke damage sustained during the Fall 2017 California wildfires (Fiscal 2019). For additional information, refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nRestructuring and Other Strategic Business Development Costs\nWe recognized costs primarily in connection with (i) costs from our ongoing efforts to gain efficiencies and reduce our cost structure in connection with a program intended to optimize the Wine and Spirits segment (Fiscal 2020) and (ii) costs recognized in connection with the development of a program specifically intended to identify opportunities for further streamlining of processes and improving capabilities, linking strategy with execution, prioritizing resources, and enabling a new ERP system.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nWe recognized trademark impairment losses related to our Beer segment\u2019s Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset. For additional information, refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nTransaction, Integration, and Other Acquisition-Related Costs\nWe recognized transaction, integration, and other acquisition-related costs in connection with our acquisitions, divestitures, and investments.\nNet Gain (Loss) on Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts Associated with Acquisition of Investment\nWe recognized a net loss in connection with the settlement of foreign currency option contracts entered into to fix the U.S. dollar cost of the November 2018 Canopy Transaction.\nDeferred Compensation\nWe recognized an adjustment related to prior periods to correct for previously unrecognized deferred compensation costs associated with certain employment agreements.\nOther Gains (Losses)\nWe recognized other gains (losses) primarily in connection with (i) a gain on the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in Nelson\u2019s Green Brier to the acquisition-date fair value (Fiscal 2020), (ii) an increase in estimated fair value of a contingent liability associated with a prior period acquisition (Fiscal 2020), (iii) recognition of previously deferred gain upon release of a related guarantee (Fiscal 2020), and (iv) a gain primarily in connection with the sale of certain non-core assets (Fiscal 2019).\nImpairment of Assets Held for Sale\nWe recognized an impairment of long-lived assets held for sale in connection with the New Wine and Spirits Transactions, Other Wine and Spirits Transactions, and the Ballast Point Transaction.\nGain (Loss) on Sale of Business\nWe recognized a net gain on sale of the Black Velvet Canadian Whisky business.\nIncome (Loss) from Unconsolidated Investments\nWe recognized an unrealized gain (loss) primarily from (i) the changes in fair value of our securities measured at fair value, (ii) the increase in fair value resulting from the June 2019 modification\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 40\nof the terms of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants (Fiscal 2020), (iii) equity in earnings (losses) from Canopy\u2019s results of operations and related activities, and (iv) a net gain in connection with the sale of our Accolade Wine Investment (Fiscal 2019).

FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 41\nThe decrease in Wine and Spirits net sales is primarily due to (i) $193.0 million decline in branded wine and spirits volume and (ii) $26.0 million decrease in net sales from the Black Velvet Divestiture, partially offset by (i) $20.0 million of favorable product mix shift and (ii) $7.7 million favorable impact from pricing. The Wine and Spirits Fiscal 2020 results have been negatively impacted by transition activities with distributors who are repositioning for ownership of brands upon closing the New Wine and Spirits Transactions and the Black Velvet Divestiture.\nCanopy Segment\nOur ownership interest in Canopy allows us to exercise significant influence, but not control, and, therefore, we account for our investment in Canopy under the equity method. Amounts included for the Canopy segment represent 100% of Canopy\u2019s reported results on a two-month lag, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and converted from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars. Although we own less than 100% of the outstanding shares of Canopy, 100% of the Canopy results are included and subsequently eliminated in order to reconcile to our consolidated financial statements. Canopy segment amounts reflect twelve months of activity for Fiscal 2020 as compared with two months of activity for Fiscal 2019, due to the timing of the November 2018 Canopy Investment. See \u201cIncome (Loss) from Unconsolidated Investments\u201d below for a discussion of Canopy\u2019s net sales, gross profit (loss), selling, general, and administrative expenses, and operating income (loss).\nGross Profit\nFiscal 2020\nFiscal 2019\nDollar\nChange\nPercent\nChange\n(in millions)\nBeer\n$\n3,125.2\n$\n2,830.7\n$\n294.5\n%\nWine and Spirits\n1,189.0\n1,279.5\n(90.5\n)\n(7\n%)\nCanopy\n45.4\n11.2\n34.2\nNM\nConsolidation and Eliminations\n(45.4\n)\n(11.2\n)\n(34.2\n)\nNM\nComparable Adjustments\n(162.3\n)\n(29.9\n)\n(132.4\n)\nNM\nConsolidated gross profit\n$\n4,151.9\n$\n4,080.3\n$\n71.6\n%\nThe increase in Beer is primarily due to $183.4 million of volume growth, $118.4 million of favorable impact from pricing, and $17.5 million of lower cost of product sold for our Mexican beer business, partially offset by a decline of $14.0 million in our craft beer portfolio. The lower cost of product sold is largely due to foreign currency transactional benefits of $24.2 million and decreased operational costs of $3.9 million, partially offset by increased warehousing and transportation costs of $10.6 million.\nThe decrease in Wine and Spirits is largely due to (i) $83.1 million of decline in branded wine and spirits volume, (ii) $27.2 million higher cost of product sold, and (iii) $12.3 million decrease in gross profit from the Black Velvet Divestiture, partially offset by $27.3 million of favorable product mix shift. The higher cost of product sold is largely attributable to higher grape raw material and processing costs as well as increased transportation costs.\nGross profit as a percent of net sales decreased to 49.8% for Fiscal 2020 compared with 50.3% for Fiscal 2019. This was largely due to an unfavorable change of 155 basis points in Comparable Adjustments and higher cost of product sold within the Wine and Spirits segment, which resulted in approximately 30 basis points of rate decline, partially offset by rate growth from (i) the favorable impact from Beer pricing in select markets, which contributed approximately 70 basis points, (ii) favorable impact from Wine and Spirits product mix shift, which resulted in 20 basis points, (iii) lower cost of product sold within the Beer segment, which resulted in 20 basis points of rate growth, and (iv) favorable volume growth from Beer which resulted in approximately 20 basis points.\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

The increase in marketing spend is due to planned investment to support the growth of our Mexican beer portfolio, including support of the new product introductions. The increase in general and administrative expenses is largely driven by increased headcount supporting the growth of the business, partially offset by favorable foreign currency transaction gains.\nThe decrease in Wine and Spirits is largely due to a decrease of $19.4 million in general and administrative expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is driven by certain cost saving initiatives including decreased compensation and benefits.\nThe increase in Corporate Operations and Other is due to an increase of approximately $17 million in insurance related costs, $13 million in compensation and benefits, and higher information technology costs supporting the implementation of our new ERP system, partially offset by a reduction in consulting costs.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 19.4% for Fiscal 2020 as compared with 20.6% for Fiscal 2019. The decrease is driven largely by (i) a favorable change of 170 basis points in Comparable Adjustments. The rate decline was offset by an increase in Corporate Operations and Other and Beer selling, general, and administrative expenses, which resulted in approximately 30 basis points and 10 basis points of rate growth, respectively.\nOperating Income (Loss)\nFiscal 2020\nFiscal 2019\nDollar\nChange\nPercent\nChange\n(in millions)\nBeer\n$\n2,247.9\n$\n2,042.9\n$\n205.0\n%\nWine and Spirits\n708.4\n771.2\n(62.8\n)\n(8\n%)\nCorporate Operations and Other\n(223.9\n)\n(197.9\n)\n(26.0\n)\n(13\n%)\nCanopy\n(685.8\n)\n(82.7\n)\n(603.1\n)\nNM\nConsolidation and Eliminations\n685.8\n82.7\n603.1\nNM\nComparable Adjustments\n(577.9\n)\n(204.0\n)\n(373.9\n)\nNM\nConsolidated operating income\n$\n2,154.5\n$\n2,412.2\n$\n(257.7\n)\n(11\n%)\nThe increase in Beer is primarily attributable to the strong volume growth and favorable pricing impact, partially offset by the planned increase in marketing spend combined with the decline in craft beer.\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

This decrease is driven largely by an unrealized net loss of $2,126.4 million for Fiscal 2020, which consists of an unrealized net loss from the changes in fair value of our securities measured at fair value of $3,302.4 million, partially offset by an unrealized gain of $1,176.0 million from the June 2019 modification of the terms of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants, as compared with an unrealized net gain of $1,971.2 million recognized for Fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2020 was also negatively impacted by $575.9 million of equity in losses from Canopy\u2019s results of operations, and related activities, while Fiscal 2019 benefited from a net gain in connection with the sale of our Accolade Wine Investment of $99.8 million.\nCanopy Segment\nCanopy\u2019s Fiscal 2020 net sales; gross profit (loss); selling, general, and administrative expenses; and operating income (loss) are not comparable against Fiscal 2019 due the timing of the November 2018 Canopy Investment and recognizing equity in earnings (losses) and related activities on a two-month lag. We have recognized twelve months of activity for Fiscal 2020 as compared with two months of activity for Fiscal 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $428.7 million for Fiscal 2020 from $367.1 million for Fiscal 2019, an increase of $61.6 million, or 17%. This increase is predominantly due to higher average borrowings of approximately $1.7 billion primarily attributable to the November 2018 Canopy Transaction.\n(Provision For) Benefit From Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for Fiscal 2020 was 102.3% of tax benefit as compared with 16.5% of tax expense for Fiscal 2019. The change in effective tax rate was driven primarily by the recognition of a $547.4 million net income tax benefit resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets for Fiscal 2020 in connection with the September 2019 enactment of tax reform in Switzerland. The Fiscal 2020 rate also benefited from (i) a higher effective rate of tax benefit from our foreign businesses including the tax benefits recorded on the net unrealized loss from the changes in fair value of our investments in Canopy and the tax benefits recorded on the Canopy equity in losses and related activities and (ii) recognition of net income tax benefits from stock-based compensation award activity.\nFor additional information, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nWe expect our reported effective tax rate for the next fiscal year to be in the range of 17% to 19%. This includes an estimated impact for (i) benefits related to the recognition of the income tax effect of stock-based compensation awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled and (ii) lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses. This range does not reflect (i) any potential impacts from COVID-19, (ii) any future changes in the fair value of our Canopy investments measured at fair value and any future equity in earnings (losses) and related activities from the Canopy Equity Method Investment, and (iii) any additional gain (loss) recognized in connection with the New Wine and Spirits Transactions, Other Wine and Spirits Transactions, and the Ballast Point Transaction since these estimates are not currently available.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 44\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to CBI\nNet income (loss) attributable to CBI decreased to $(11.8) million for Fiscal 2020 from $3,435.9 million for Fiscal 2019. This decrease of $3,447.7 million is largely attributable to the significant decrease in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments discussed above, an impairment of long-lived assets held for sale as well as the decline in operating performance from Wine and Spirits. These decreases were partially offset by solid operating performance from Beer contributing an additional $205.0 million of operating income.\nFINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nGeneral\nOur ability to consistently generate cash flow from operating activities is one of our most significant financial strengths. Our strong cash flows enable us to invest in our people and our brands, make appropriate capital investments, provide a quarterly cash dividend program, and from time-to-time, repurchase shares of our common stock and make strategic investments and acquisitions that we believe will enhance shareholder value. Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operating activities. Our principal use of cash in our operating activities is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable. Historically, we have used cash flow from operating activities to repay our short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures. Additionally, we have a commercial paper program which we use to fund our short-term borrowing requirements and to maintain our access to the capital markets. We will continue to use our short-term borrowings, including our commercial paper program, to support our working capital requirements and capital expenditures. COVID-19 has negatively impacted the global economy and financial markets which could interfere with our ability to access sources of liquidity at favorable rates and generate operating cash flows. We are currently evaluating recent COVID-19 related legislation and governmental initiatives and expect to take advantage of opportunities to temporarily defer some payments including certain excise and payroll taxes.\nWe have maintained adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. Absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, primarily short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share repurchases, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs.\nWe have plans to sell a portion of our U.S. wine and spirits business. We expect to use the net cash proceeds from closing these transactions primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings.\nThe November 2017 Canopy Warrants with an exercise price of C$12.98 per warrant share will expire on May 1, 2020. We will evaluate exercise of the warrants immediately prior to expiration. If a decision is made to exercise the November 2017 Canopy Warrants, we expect to fund the C$245 million transaction with cash from operations.\nCash Flows\nFiscal 2020\nFiscal 2019\nDollar Change\n(in millions)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n2,551.1\n$\n2,246.3\n$\n304.8\nInvesting activities\n(531.0\n)\n(4,831.8\n)\n4,300.8\nFinancing activities\n(2,031.4\n)\n2,593.3\n(4,624.7\n)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n(0.9\n)\n(4.5\n)\n3.6\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n(12.2\n)\n$\n3.3\n$\n(15.5\n)\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 45\nOperating Activities\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities for Fiscal 2020 is largely due to strong cash flow from the Beer segment driven primarily by the segment\u2019s solid operating results, combined with the timing of collections for recoverable value-added taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities also benefited from lower income tax payments largely due to a change in estimated taxable income and the receipt of a higher federal tax refund for Fiscal 2020 as compared with Fiscal 2019. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by higher cash outflows from accounts payable primarily attributable to the timing of payments for the Wine and Spirits segment.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2020 decreased primarily due to the $3,869.9 million November 2018 Canopy Transaction, proceeds of $269.7 million from the November 2019 Black Velvet Divestiture, and lower Fiscal 2020 capital expenditures of $159.8 million. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by proceeds received in Fiscal 2019 of $110.2 million from the May 2018 sale of our Accolade Wine Investment.\nBusiness acquisitions, divestitures, and investments consist primarily of the following:\nAcquisitions\nDivestitures\nInvestments\nFiscal 2020\n\u25cf Nelson\u2019s Green Brier\n\u25cf Black Velvet Canadian Whisky\nFiscal 2019\n\u25cf Four Corners\n\u25cf Accolade Wine Investment\n\u25cf November 2018 Canopy Investment\nFinancing Activities\nThe increase in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities consists of:\nFiscal 2020\nFiscal 2019\nDollar\nChange\n(in millions)\nNet proceeds from (payments of) debt, current and long-term, and related activities\n$\n(1,464.8\n)\n$\n3,605.7\n$\n(5,070.5\n)\nDividends paid\n(569.2\n)\n(557.7\n)\n(11.5\n)\nPurchases of treasury stock\n(50.0\n)\n(504.3\n)\n454.3\nNet cash provided by stock-based compensation activities\n63.9\n49.6\n14.3\nPayment of contingent consideration\n(11.3\n)\n-\n(11.3\n)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n$\n(2,031.4\n)\n$\n2,593.3\n$\n(4,624.7\n)\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 46\nDebt\nTotal debt outstanding as of February 29, 2020, amounted to $12,184.6 million, a decrease of $1,431.9 million from February 28, 2019. The decrease consisted of:\nBank Facilities\nIn June 2019, we entered into the 2019 Term Credit Agreement which resulted in the creation of a $491.3 million five-year term loan facility. We utilized the proceeds from the borrowings under the 2019 Term Credit Agreement to repay in full the U.S. Term A-1 Facility under the 2018 Credit Agreement.\nIn March 2020, we entered into the 2020 Restatement Agreement that amended and restated the 2018 Credit Agreement. The 2020 Restatement Agreement resulted in (i) the removal of the subsidiary guarantees and termination of the guarantee agreement, (ii) the inclusion of the parent guaranty provisions in connection with the termination of the guarantee agreement, (iii) the removal of certain provisions pertaining to term loans since no term loans are outstanding, and (iv) the revision of the LIBOR successor rate provisions to permit the use of rates based on the SOFR administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nIn March 2020, we entered into the Term Loan Restatement Agreement and the 2020 Term Loan Restatement Agreement, that amended and restated the Term Credit Agreement and the 2019 Term Credit Agreement, respectively. The Term Loan Restatement Agreement and the 2020 Term Loan Restatement Agreement each resulted in (i) the removal of the subsidiary guarantees and termination of the respective guarantee agreements and (ii) the revision of the LIBOR successor rate provisions in each to permit the use of rates based on SOFR.\nSenior Notes\nIn July 2019, we issued the July 2019 Senior Notes. Proceeds from this offering, net of discount and debt issuance costs, of $793.0 million were used for the repayment of our 3.875% November 2014 Senior Notes and a portion of the outstanding obligations under the Five-Year Term Facility under our Term Credit Agreement.\nGeneral\nThe majority of our outstanding borrowings as of February 29, 2020, consisted of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, with maturities ranging from calendar 2020 to calendar 2048, and variable-rate senior unsecured term loan facilities under our Term Credit Agreement and 2019 Term Credit Agreement, with maturities ranging from calendar 2021 to calendar 2024.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 47\nAdditionally, we have a commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion of commercial paper. Our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the amount available under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 Credit Agreement.\nWe do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper and, therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. If the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding commercial paper borrowings mature, we will utilize unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 Credit Agreement to repay commercial paper borrowings. We do not expect that fluctuations in demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 Credit Agreement.\nWe had the following borrowing capacity available under our 2018 Credit Agreement:\nRemaining Borrowing Capacity\nFebruary 29,\nApril 15,\n(in millions)\nRevolving Credit Facility (1)\n$\n1,749.2\n$\n1,988.2\n(1)\nNet of outstanding revolving credit facility borrowings and outstanding letters of credit under our 2018 Credit Agreement and outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program.\nThe financial institutions participating in our 2018 Credit Agreement have complied with prior funding requests and we believe such financial institutions will comply with any future funding requests. However, there can be no assurances that any particular financial institution will continue to do so.\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to covenants that are contained in the 2018 Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness) by subsidiaries, additional liens, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions, and thresholds. The financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 48\nleverage ratio, both as defined in the 2018 Credit Agreement. As of February 29, 2020, under the 2018 Credit Agreement, the minimum interest coverage ratio was 2.5x and the maximum net leverage ratio was 5.0x.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default set forth in our Term Credit Agreement and our 2019 Term Credit Agreement are substantially similar to those set forth in our 2018 Credit Agreement.\nOur indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes contain certain covenants, including, but not limited to: (i) a limitation on liens on certain assets, (ii) a limitation on certain sale and leaseback transactions, and (iii) restrictions on mergers, consolidations, and the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to another person. Upon the March 2020 removal of all of the subsidiary guarantors from our 2018 Credit Agreement, the subsidiary guarantors were automatically released from the indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes.\nAs of February 29, 2020, we were in compliance with our covenants under the 2018 Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement, 2019 Term Credit Agreement, and our indentures, and have met all debt payment obligations.\nFor a complete discussion and presentation of all borrowings and available sources of borrowing, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nCommon Stock Dividends\nOn April 2, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per share of Class A Common Stock, $0.68 per share of Class B Convertible Common Stock, and $0.68 per share of Class 1 Common Stock payable on May 19, 2020, to stockholders of record of each class on May 5, 2020. We expect to return approximately $565 million to stockholders in Fiscal 2021 through cash dividends.\nWe currently expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of our common stock in the future, but such payments are subject to approval of our Board of Directors and are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors, including those set forth under Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur Board of Directors have authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock under the 2018 Authorization. Shares repurchased under this authorization have become treasury shares.\nAs of February 29, 2020, total shares repurchased under this authorization are as follows:\nClass A Common Shares\nRepurchase Authorization\nDollar Value of Shares Repurchased\nNumber of Shares Repurchased\n(in millions, except share data)\n2018 Authorization\n$\n3,000.0\n$\n1,045.9\n4,897,605\nShare repurchases under the 2018 Authorization may be accomplished at management\u2019s discretion from time to time based on market conditions, our cash and debt position, and other factors as determined by management.

Interest payments on long-term debt do not include interest related to finance lease obligations, which represent approximately 0.2% of our total long-term debt, as amounts are not material.\n(2)\nIncludes $45.8 million associated with expected payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as of February 29, 2020, $0.5 million of which is expected to be paid in the less than one year period. The payments are reflected in the period in which we believe they will ultimately be settled based on our experience in these matters. Other long-term liabilities do not include payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $203.6 million due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. In addition, other long-term liabilities do not include expected payments for interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as amounts are not material. For a detailed discussion of these items, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\n(3)\nConsists primarily of $4,789.5 million for contracts to purchase certain raw materials and supplies over the next eighteen fiscal years and approximately $115 million for contracts to purchase equipment and services related to the construction of the Mexicali Brewery. For further information about these purchase obligations, and others, refer to \u201cCapital Expenditures\u201d below and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 50\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring Fiscal 2020, we incurred $726.5 million for capital expenditures, including $571.7 million for the Beer segment primarily for (i) our Obregon Brewery optimization and expansion, (ii) our Nava Brewery and glass production plant expansions, and (iii) our Mexicali Brewery construction (collectively, the \u201cMexico Beer Expansion Projects\u201d). Management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current business needs. We do not believe it is prudent at this time to provide capital expenditure guidance for Fiscal 2021 as we are not able to estimate the long-term impact of COVID-19, including the demand for our products and the impact on the timeframes for completion of our Mexico Beer Expansion Projects.\nIn fiscal 2017, we began construction of the Mexicali Brewery. In March 2020, a public consultation on the construction of our Mexicali Brewery was held. We have initiated early stage discussions with government officials in Mexico regarding next steps for our brewery construction project and options elsewhere in the country following the result of the public consultation. These discussions have been positive and we will continue working with government officials to mutually agree upon a path forward. In the medium-term, we have ample capacity, based on current growth forecasts and production capabilities at the Nava and Obregon breweries, to meet consumer needs. As of February 29, 2020, we recognized approximately $700 million of capital expenditures for construction in progress related to the Mexicali Brewery.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nOur results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices. We intend to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices, subject to normal competitive conditions. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices. In addition, we continue to identify on-going cost savings initiatives.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. However, certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying those policies, management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical experience, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business. Our critical accounting estimates include:\n\u2022\nFair value of financial instruments. Certain inputs and assumptions to models used to determine fair value measurements require judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. The use of certain inputs may include information derived through extrapolation or interpolation which involves management assumptions as well as valuation\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 51\ntechniques. The fair values of our financial instruments that require the application of significant judgment by management are as follows:\nCanopy investments\nEquity securities, Warrants - estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement) and Monte Carlo simulations (Level 2 fair value measurement). These valuation models use various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining contractual term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable. Management applies significant judgment in its determination of expected volatility. We consider both historical and implied volatility levels of the underlying equity security and apply limited consideration of historical peer group volatility levels.\nDebt securities, Convertible - estimated using a binomial lattice option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement), which includes an estimate of the credit spread based on the implied spread as of the issuance date of the notes. This valuation model uses various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable.\nManagement\u2019s estimate of fair value requires significant management judgment and is subject to a high degree of variability based upon market conditions, the availability of specific information and management\u2019s assumptions.\n\u2022\nGoodwill and other intangible assets. We account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories: (i) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, (ii) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization, and (iii) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. We perform annual impairment tests and re-evaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of January 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment or change in useful life might exist.\nThe guidance for goodwill impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or to proceed directly to performing a quantitative impairment test. Under the quantitative assessment, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value, including goodwill. The estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally calculated based on an income approach using the discounted cash flow method. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, a goodwill impairment will be recognized. The amount of impairment charge for goodwill is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. Our reporting units with goodwill include the Beer segment and the Wine and Spirits segment. In estimating the fair value of the reporting units, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings, and other factors. The assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are based on historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans. These assumptions reflect management\u2019s estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss for these assets. The recognition of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 52\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis using the quantitative assessment. No indication of impairment was noted for any of our reporting units, as the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value. Based on this analysis, the reporting unit with the lowest amount of estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value was the Wine and Spirits reporting unit with approximately 107% excess fair value. For Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analyses, we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for either of our reporting units.\nThe most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculation to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units in connection with the impairment testing are: (i) the discount rate, (ii) the expected long-term growth rate, and (iii) the annual cash flow projections. As of January 1, 2020, if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of goodwill, then the changes individually would not have resulted in the carrying value of the respective reporting unit\u2019s net assets, including its goodwill, exceeding its estimated fair value, which would indicate the potential for impairment and the requirement to measure the amount of impairment, if any.\nOur other intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. Customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The trademarks that were determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. The guidance for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. Under the quantitative assessment, our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method. The estimate of fair value is then compared to the carrying value of each trademark. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the trademark, then an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value. In estimating the fair value of the trademarks, management must make assumptions and projections regarding future cash flows based upon future revenues and other factors. The assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans. These assumptions reflect management\u2019s estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss for these assets. The recognition of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2020, certain continuing negative trends within our Beer segment\u2019s Ballast Point craft beer portfolio, including increased rate of revenue decline and increased competition, indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the Ballast Point craft beer trademarks might be below its carrying value. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment. As a result of this assessment, the Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset recognized an impairment loss of $11.0 million. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Beer segment\u2019s Ballast Point business recognized a trademark impairment loss of $108.0 million in connection with certain continuing negative trends within its craft beer portfolio and a change in strategy for this portfolio focused on improving profitability by rationalizing the number of product offerings while targeting distribution growth in select strategic markets. In the first\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 53\nquarter of fiscal 2018, the Beer segment\u2019s Ballast Point business recognized a trademark impairment loss of $86.8 million in connection with certain negative trends within its craft beer portfolio.\nThe most significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are: (i) the estimated royalty rate, (ii) the discount rate, (iii) the expected long-term growth rate, and (iv) the annual revenue projections. As of January 1, 2020, if we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower or used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives, then each change individually would not have resulted in any unit of accounting\u2019s carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value.\nThe guidance for divestitures requires that when some, but not all of a reporting unit is disposed of, some of the goodwill of the reporting unit should be allocated to the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of, if that portion constitutes a business. The allocation of goodwill shall be based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit remaining. This approach requires a determination of the fair value of both the business being disposed and the businesses retained within the reporting unit.\nOur estimate of fair value for the New Wine and Spirits Transactions was determined based on the expected proceeds from the transactions. The components being sold are a part of the Wine and Spirits segment and were included in our wine and spirits reporting unit. Accordingly, goodwill was allocated to the New Wine and Spirits Transactions assets held for sale based on the relative fair value of the businesses being sold compared to the relative fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill not allocated to assets held for sale remains in the wine and spirits reporting unit.\n\u2022\nAccounting for income taxes. We estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities, income taxes payable, provision for income taxes, and unrecognized tax benefit liabilities based upon various factors including, but not limited to, historical pretax operating income, future estimates of pretax operating income, differences between book and tax treatment of various items of income and expense, interpretation of tax laws, and tax planning strategies. We are subject to income taxes in Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, the U.S., and other jurisdictions. We are regularly audited by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, is audited and finally resolved.\nWe believe that all tax positions are fully supported. However, we recognize tax assets and liabilities in accordance with the FASB guidance for income tax accounting. Accordingly, we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. We measure and recognize the tax benefit from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. In addition, changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. Changes in current estimates, if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.\nWe recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our results of operations. If necessary, we recognize a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 54\nrealized. We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, historical, and projected operating results, and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The realization of deferred tax assets is evaluated by jurisdiction and the realizability of these assets can vary based on the character of the tax attribute and the carryforward periods specific to each jurisdiction. We believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our existing deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. Changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets will be reflected in our effective tax rate in the period in which they are determined.\nACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nAccounting guidance adopted for Fiscal 2020 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. For additional information on recently adopted accounting guidance refer to Note 1 in the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 55\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs a result of our global operating, investment, acquisition and financing activities, we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, and equity prices. To manage the volatility relating to these risks, we periodically purchase and/or sell derivative instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity swap contracts, interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock contracts. We use derivative instruments to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates, as well as to hedge economic exposures. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nForeign Currency and Commodity Price Risk\nForeign currency derivative instruments are or may be used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, forecasted foreign currency denominated sales/purchases to/from third parties as well as intercompany sales/purchases, intercompany principal and interest payments, and in connection with investments, acquisitions, or divestitures outside the U.S. As of February 29, 2020, we had exposures to foreign currency risk primarily related to the Mexican peso, euro, Canadian dollar, and New Zealand dollar. Approximately 84% of our balance sheet exposures and forecasted transactional exposures for the year ending February 28, 2021, were hedged as of February 29, 2020.\nCommodity derivative instruments are or may be used to hedge forecasted commodity purchases from third parties as either economic hedges or accounting hedges. As of February 29, 2020, exposures to commodity price risk which we are currently hedging include aluminum, corn, diesel fuel, natural gas, and wheat prices. Approximately 83% of our forecasted transactional exposures for the year ending February 28, 2021, were hedged as of February 29, 2020.\nWe have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of foreign exchange rates and commodity prices reflecting the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market. The volatility of the applicable rates and prices is dependent on many factors which cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. Losses or gains from the revaluation or settlement of the related underlying positions would substantially offset such losses or gains on the derivative instruments. The aggregate notional value, estimated fair value, and sensitivity analysis for our open foreign currency and commodity derivative instruments are summarized as follows:\nAggregate\nNotional Value\nFair Value,\nNet Asset (Liability)\nIncrease (Decrease)\nin Fair Value -\nHypothetical\n10% Adverse Change\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\n(in millions)\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n3,011.2\n$\n2,039.6\n$\n61.9\n$\n22.5\n$\n(193.3\n)\n$\n(166.5\n)\nCommodity derivative contracts\n$\n282.8\n$\n284.7\n$\n(40.3\n)\n$\n(2.9\n)\n$\n21.7\n$\n24.4\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe estimated fair value of our fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk, credit risk, and foreign currency risk. In addition, we also have variable interest rate debt outstanding (primarily LIBOR-based), certain of which includes a fixed margin subject to the same risks identified for our fixed interest rate debt.\nAs of February 29, 2020, we had $375.0 million of outstanding cash flow designated interest rate swap agreements which fixed LIBOR interest rates (to minimize interest rate volatility) on our floating LIBOR rate debt. There were no cash flow designated interest rate swap contracts outstanding as of February 28, 2019. As of February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, there were no undesignated interest rate swap contracts outstanding.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 56\nAs of February 29, 2020, we had $300.0 million of outstanding cash flow designated treasury lock agreements which fixed 10-year Treasury interest rates (to minimize interest rate volatility) on our future debt issuances. There were no cash flow designated treasury lock contracts outstanding as of February 28, 2019. As of February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, there were no undesignated treasury lock contracts outstanding.\nWe have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates reflecting the impact of a hypothetical 1% increase in the prevailing interest rates. The volatility of the applicable rates is dependent on many factors which cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. The aggregate notional value, estimated fair value, and sensitivity analysis for our outstanding fixed and variable interest rate debt, including current maturities and open interest rate derivative instruments, are summarized as follows:\nAggregate\nNotional Value\nFair Value\nNet Asset (Liability)\nIncrease (Decrease)\nin Fair Value -\nHypothetical\n1% Rate Increase\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\n(in millions)\nFixed interest rate debt\n$\n10,075.3\n$\n10,278.9\n$\n(10,942.8\n)\n$\n(10,098.5\n)\n$\n(708.4\n)\n$\n(591.0\n)\nVariable interest rate debt\n$\n2,185.4\n$\n3,422.7\n$\n(2,232.0\n)\n$\n(3,461.9\n)\n$\n(46.6\n)\n$\n(88.0\n)\nInterest rate swap contracts\n$\n375.0\n$\n-\n$\n(0.8\n)\n$\n-\n$\n(0.3\n)\n$\n-\nTreasury lock contracts\n$\n300.0\n$\n-\n$\n(7.6\n)\n$\n-\n$\n(9.7\n)\n$\n-\nEquity Price Risk\nThe estimated fair value of our investments in the Canopy warrants and the Canopy convertible debt securities are subject to equity price risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, and foreign currency risk. These investments are recognized at fair value utilizing various option-pricing models and have the potential to fluctuate from, among other items, changes in the quoted market price of the underlying equity security. We manage our equity price risk exposure by closely monitoring the financial condition, performance and outlook of Canopy Growth Corporation.\nAs of February 29, 2020, the fair value of our investments in the Canopy warrants and the Canopy convertible debt securities was $1,117.1 million, with an unrealized net gain (loss) on these investments of $(2,126.4) million recognized in our results of operations for the year ended February 29, 2020. We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of the equity price reflecting the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the quoted market price of the underlying equity security. As of February 29, 2020, such a hypothetical 10% adverse change would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of $172.0 million.\nFor additional discussion on our market risk, refer to Notes 6 and 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February 29, 2020.\nThe effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 59\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nConstellation Brands, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Constellation Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries\u2019 (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of February 29, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 29, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 29, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated April 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 60\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nRochester, New York\nApril 21, 2020\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 61\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nConstellation Brands, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Constellation Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 29, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 29, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of February 29, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated April 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAssessment of the accounting for the modification of Canopy warrants\nAs discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company modified the terms of the November 2018 Canopy warrants and certain other rights in June 2019 (the \u201cJune 2019 Warrant Modification\u201d). The accounting impacts of the June 2019 Warrant Modification included the\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 62\nrecognition of a $1,176.0 million unrealized gain on the increase in fair value of the November 2018 Canopy warrants and a $409.0 million charge against equity in earnings (losses) from the Canopy equity method investment and related activities, among other impacts described in Note 10.\nWe identified the assessment of the accounting for the June 2019 Warrant Modification as a critical audit matter because interpretation and application of the relevant accounting literature requires significant auditor judgment. In particular, the accounting for the modification involved assessments of the different types of warrants, their particular features, and the impact of those features on the classification in the financial information of Canopy.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s process to account for the June 2019 Warrant Modification, including controls related to the Company\u2019s accounting considerations of the warrants features. We assessed the accounting treatment of the June 2019 Warrant Modification through:\n\u2022\nevaluating the Company\u2019s accounting memoranda and other documentation, including application of the relevant accounting guidance;\n\u2022\ncomparing the underlying terms of the relevant documents and agreements to the Company\u2019s accounting memoranda; and\n\u2022\nindependently interpreting and applying the accounting literature to the transaction, considering alternative accounting treatments and evaluating the relative merits of the possible alternatives.\nAssessment of the measurement of fair value of the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company established policies for measuring the fair value of financial instruments, including the Canopy warrants. As of February 29, 2020, the recorded balance of the Company\u2019s investment in the Canopy warrants was $991.5 million, of which a majority relates to the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants. The Company uses option pricing models to estimate the fair value of the Canopy warrants using various market-based inputs.\nWe identified the assessment of the measurement of fair value of New November 2018 Canopy Warrants as a critical audit matter. Specifically, there was a high degree of subjectivity and judgment in evaluating the determination of the expected volatility inputs used in the option pricing models for the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants. Historical, implied, and peer group volatility levels provide a range of possible expected volatility inputs and the fair value estimates for the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants are sensitive to the expected volatility inputs.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s process to measure the fair value of the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants. This included controls related to the evaluation of observable market information used in the determination of the expected volatility inputs. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n\u2022\nevaluating the expected volatility inputs by comparing them against a volatility range that was independently developed in consideration of historical, implied, and peer group volatility information; and\n\u2022\ndeveloping an estimate of the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants\u2019 fair value using the independently developed volatility range and comparing it to the value calculated by the Company.\nEvaluation of gross unrecognized tax benefits\nAs discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. The Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest, of $249.4 million as of February 29, 2020.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 63\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company\u2019s gross unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter. Complex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the Company\u2019s interpretation of tax law and its estimate of the ultimate resolution of its tax positions.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s unrecognized tax benefit process, including controls related to the interpretation of tax law, its application in the liability estimation process, and the review of activity that could result in changes to the Company\u2019s unrecognized tax benefits. Since tax law is complex and often subject to interpretations, we involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n\u2022\nevaluating the Company\u2019s interpretation of tax laws and tax authority rulings;\n\u2022\nassessing transfer pricing studies for compliance with applicable laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nperforming an assessment of the Company\u2019s tax positions, including using sensitivity analysis, and comparing the results to the Company\u2019s assessment.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2002.\nRochester, New York\nApril 21, 2020\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFEBRUARY 29, 2020\n1.\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDescription of business\nConstellation Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries operate primarily in the beverage alcohol industry. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cCBI,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d refer to Constellation Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries. We are an international beverage alcohol company with a broad portfolio of consumer-preferred, high-end imported and craft beer brands, and higher-end wine and spirits brands.\nBasis of presentation\nPrinciples of consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our majority-owned and controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we have an equally-owned joint venture with Owens-Illinois. The joint venture owns and operates a state-of-the-art glass production plant which provides bottles exclusively for our brewery located in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico (the \u201cNava Brewery\u201d). We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of this variable interest entity and accordingly, the results of operations of the joint venture are reported in the Beer segment and are included in our consolidated results of operations. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nEquity method investments\nIf we are not required to consolidate our investment in another entity, we use the equity method when we (i) can exercise significant influence over the other entity and (ii) hold common stock and/or in-substance common stock of the other entity. Under the equity method, investments are carried at cost, plus or minus our equity in the increases and decreases in the investee\u2019s net assets after the date of acquisition. We monitor our equity method investments for factors indicating other-than-temporary impairment. Dividends received from the investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment.\nManagement\u2019s use of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSummary of significant accounting policies\nRevenue recognition\nOur revenue (referred to in our financial statements as \u201csales\u201d) consists primarily of the sale of beer, wine, and spirits domestically in the U.S. Sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed-upon credit terms. Our payment terms vary by location and customer, however, the time period between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. Our customers consist primarily of wholesale distributors. Our revenue generating activities have a single performance obligation and are recognized at the point in time when control transfers and our obligation has been fulfilled, which is when the related goods are shipped or delivered to the customer, depending upon the method of distribution, and shipping terms. We have elected to treat shipping as a fulfillment activity. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the sale of our product. Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in sales.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 70\nAs noted, the majority of our revenues are generated from the domestic sale of beer, wine, and spirits to wholesale distributors in the U.S. Our other revenue generating activities include the export of certain of our products to select international markets, as well as the sale of our products through state alcohol beverage control agencies and on-premise, retail locations in certain markets. We have evaluated these other revenue generating activities under the disaggregation disclosure criteria outlined within the amended guidance and concluded that these other revenue generating activities are immaterial for separate disclosure. See Note 23 for disclosure of net sales by product type.\nSales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs, including pricing discounts on single transactions, volume discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, coupons, and rebates. This variable consideration is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price based upon expected amounts at the time revenue for the corresponding product sale is recognized. For example, customer promotional discount programs are entered into with certain distributors for certain periods of time. The amount ultimately reimbursed to distributors is determined based upon agreed-upon promotional discounts which are applied to distributors\u2019 sales to retailers. Other common forms of variable consideration include volume rebates for meeting established sales targets, and coupons and mail-in rebates offered to the end consumer. The determination of the reduction of the transaction price for variable consideration requires that we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the timing and amounts of revenue and liabilities recognized. We estimate this variable consideration by taking into account factors such as the nature of the promotional activity, historical information, and current trends, availability of actual results and expectations of customer and consumer behavior.\nExcise taxes remitted to tax authorities are government-imposed excise taxes on our beverage alcohol products. Excise taxes are shown on a separate line item as a reduction of sales and are recognized in our results of operations when the related product sale is recognized. Excise taxes are recognized as a current liability in other accrued expenses and liabilities, with the liability subsequently reduced when the taxes are remitted to the tax authority.\nCost of product sold\nThe types of costs included in cost of product sold are raw materials, packaging materials, manufacturing costs, plant administrative support and overheads, and freight and warehouse costs (including distribution network costs). Distribution network costs include inbound freight charges and outbound shipping and handling costs, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing and internal transfer costs.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nThe types of costs included in selling, general, and administrative expenses consist predominately of advertising and non-manufacturing administrative and overhead costs. Distribution network costs are included in cost of product sold. We expense advertising costs as incurred, shown, or distributed. Advertising expense for the years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019, and February 28, 2018, was $769.5 million, $700.8 million, and $615.7 million, respectively.\nForeign currency translation\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the respective local currency. The translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recognized as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (\u201cAOCI\u201d). Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency denominated transactions are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity when purchased of three months or less and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 71\nFair value of financial instruments\nWe calculate the estimated fair value of financial instruments using quoted market prices whenever available. When quoted market prices are not available, we use standard pricing models for various types of financial instruments (such as forwards, options, swaps, and convertible debt) which take into account the present value of estimated future cash flows (see Note 7).\nDerivative instruments\nWe enter into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. We enter into derivatives for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships as well as those derivatives utilized as economic hedges. We do not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at estimated fair value (see Notes 6 and 7). We present our derivative positions gross on our balance sheets.\nThe change in the fair value of outstanding cash flow hedges is deferred in stockholders\u2019 equity as a component of AOCI. For all periods presented herein, gains or losses deferred in stockholders\u2019 equity as a component of AOCI are recognized in our results of operations in the same period in which the hedged items are recognized and on the same financial statement line item as the hedged items.\nChanges in fair values for derivative instruments not designated in a hedge accounting relationship are recognized directly in our results of operations each period and on the same financial statement line item as the hedged item. For purposes of measuring segment operating performance, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of our undesignated commodity derivative contracts, prior to settlement, is reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is recognized in the segment operating results. Upon settlement, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the undesignated commodity derivative contracts is reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing our operating segment results to reflect the economic effects of the commodity derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.\nCash flows from the settlement of derivatives, including both economic hedges and those designated in hedge accounting relationships, appear on our statements of cash flows in the same categories as the cash flows of the hedged items.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Elements of cost include materials, labor, and overhead.\nBulk wine inventories are included as in-process inventories within current assets, in accordance with the general practices of the wine industry, although a portion of such inventories may be aged for periods greater than one year. A substantial portion of barreled whiskey and brandy will not be sold within one year because of the duration of the aging process. All barreled whiskey and brandy are classified as in-process inventories and are included in current assets, in accordance with industry practice. Warehousing, insurance, value added taxes, and other carrying charges applicable to barreled whiskey and brandy held for aging are included in inventory costs.\nWe assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand, and market requirements.\nProperty, plant, and equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment is stated at cost. Major additions and improvements are recognized as an increase to the property accounts, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost of properties sold or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 72\nare eliminated from the balance sheet accounts at the time of disposal and resulting gains and losses are included as a component of operating income.\nInterest incurred relating to expansion, construction, and optimization of facilities is capitalized to construction in progress. We cease the capitalization of interest when construction activities are substantially completed and the facility and related assets are available for their intended use. At this point, construction in progress is transferred to the appropriate asset class.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:\nYears\nLand improvements\n15 to 32\nVineyards\n16 to 26\nBuildings and improvements\n10 to 50\nMachinery and equipment\n3 to 35\nMotor vehicles\n3 to 8\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\nGoodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. We review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually for impairment, or sooner, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We use January 1 as our annual impairment test measurement date. Indefinite lived intangible assets consist principally of trademarks. Intangible assets determined to have a finite life, primarily customer relationships, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to review for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Note 9 provides a summary of intangible assets segregated between amortizable and nonamortizable amounts.\nIndemnification liabilities\nWe have indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures. Indemnification liabilities are recognized when probable and estimable and included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities (see Note 17).\nIncome taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method accounts for deferred income taxes by applying statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries (\u201cGILTI\u201d) is subject to U.S. tax. We treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current period tax expense when incurred. We provide deferred income taxes, consisting primarily of foreign withholding and state taxes, on all applicable unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Interest and penalties are recognized as a component of (provision for) benefit from income taxes.\nNet income (loss) per common share attributable to CBI\nWe have two classes of common stock with a material number of shares outstanding: Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock (see Note 18). In addition, we have another class of common stock with an immaterial number of shares outstanding: Class 1 Common Stock (see Note 18). If we pay a cash dividend on Class B Convertible Common Stock, each share of Class A Common Stock will receive an amount at least ten percent greater than the amount of the cash dividend per share paid on Class B Convertible Common Stock. Class B Convertible Common Stock shares are convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis at any time at the option of the holder.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 73\nWe use the two-class method for the computation and presentation of net income (loss) per common share attributable to CBI (hereafter referred to as \u201cnet income (loss) per common share\u201d) (see Note 20). The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that calculates basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share for each class of common stock separately based on dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period. Under the two-class method, Class A Common Stock is assumed to receive a ten percent greater participation in undistributed earnings (losses) than Class B Convertible Common Stock, in accordance with the respective minimum dividend rights of each class of stock.\nNet income (loss) per common share - basic excludes the effect of common stock equivalents and is computed using the two-class method. Net income (loss) per common share - diluted for Class A Common Stock reflects the potential dilution that could result if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Net income (loss) per common share - diluted for Class A Common Stock is computed using the more dilutive of the if-converted or two-class method. Net income (loss) per common share - diluted for Class A Common Stock is computed using the if-converted method and assumes the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method and the conversion of Class B Convertible Common Stock as this method is more dilutive than the two-class method. Net income (loss) per common share - diluted for Class B Convertible Common Stock is computed using the two-class method and does not assume conversion of Class B Convertible Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock.\nStock-based employee compensation\nWe have two stock-based employee compensation plans (see Note 19). We apply grant date fair-value-based measurement methods in accounting for our stock-based payment arrangements and recognize all costs resulting from stock-based payment transactions, net of expected forfeitures, ratably over the requisite service period. Stock-based awards are subject to specific vesting conditions, generally time vesting, or upon retirement, disability, or death of the employee (as defined by the plan), if earlier. For awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, we recognize compensation expense ratably over the period from the date of grant to the date of retirement-eligibility.\nRecently adopted accounting guidance\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance for the accounting for leases. Under this guidance, a lessee recognizes assets and liabilities on its balance sheet for most leases. Lease expense continues to be consistent with previous guidance. Additionally, this guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements.\nWe adopted this guidance on March 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach, accordingly, prior period balances and disclosures have not been restated. We elected the package of transition practical expedients for expired or existing contracts, which retains prior conclusions reached on lease identification, classification, and initial direct costs incurred.\nWe finalized the implementation of changes to our accounting policies, systems and controls, including a new leasing software to capture the required data for accounting and disclosure. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets of $585.4 million and operating lease liabilities of $619.7 million as of March 1, 2019, and did not have a material impact on our results of operations or liquidity.\nFor additional information on leases, refer to Note 16.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 74\n2. ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION\nAcquisitions\nNelson\u2019s Green Brier\nIn May 2019, we increased our ownership interest in Nelson\u2019s Green Brier Distillery, LLC (\u201cNelson\u2019s Green Brier\u201d) to 75%, resulting in consolidation of the business and recognition of a 25% noncontrolling interest. This acquisition included a portfolio of award-winning, Tennessee-based craft bourbon and whiskey products. The preliminary fair value of the business combination was allocated primarily to goodwill, trademarks, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment. The results of operations of Nelson\u2019s Green Brier are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.\nWe recognized a gain of $11.8 million for the year ended February 29, 2020, related to the remeasurement of our previously held 20% equity interest in Nelson\u2019s Green Brier to the acquisition-date fair value. This gain is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated results of operations.\nOther acquisitions\nDuring the year ended February 28, 2019, we completed the acquisitions of other businesses, including the Four Corners Brewing Company LLC business, which included a portfolio of high-quality, dynamic, and bicultural, Texas-based craft beers (\u201cFour Corners\u201d), and a business in Italy, which provided additional processing and sourcing capabilities for our Italian wine portfolio. The purchase price for the Four Corners acquisition was primarily allocated to goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, and trademarks, plus an earn-out over five years based on the performance of the brands. The purchase price for the acquired business in Italy was primarily allocated to a production facility, vineyards, and inventory. The results of operations of these acquired businesses are reported in the respective segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from their respective date of acquisition.\nDuring the year ended February 28, 2018, we completed the acquisitions of other businesses, including the Funky Buddha Brewery LLC business, which included a portfolio of high-quality, Florida-based craft beers (\u201cFunky Buddha\u201d), and the Schrader Cellars, LLC business, which included a collection of highly-rated, limited-production fine wines. The total combined purchase price for these acquisitions was $149.8 million. The purchase price for each acquisition was primarily allocated to goodwill and trademarks. In addition, the purchase price for Funky Buddha includes an earn-out over five years based on the performance of the brands. The results of operations of these acquired businesses are reported in the respective segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from their respective date of acquisition.\nDivestitures\nBlack Velvet Divestiture\nOn November 1, 2019, we sold the Black Velvet Canadian Whisky business and the brand\u2019s associated production facility, along with a subset of Canadian whisky brands produced at that facility, and related inventory at a transaction value of $266.3 million (the \u201cBlack Velvet Divestiture\u201d). We received cash proceeds of $269.7 million, subject to estimated working capital adjustments. The cash proceeds were utilized to partially repay the 2.00% November 2017 Senior Notes (as defined in Note 13). The following table summarizes the net gain recognized in connection with this divestiture:\n(in millions)\nCash received from buyer\n$\n269.7\nNet assets sold\n(213.3\n)\nAOCI reclassification adjustments, primarily foreign currency translation\n20.9\nDirect costs to sell\n(3.2\n)\nGain on sale of business\n$\n74.1\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 75\nSale of Accolade Wine Investment\nIn May 2018, we completed the sale of our remaining interest in our previously-owned Australian and European business (the \u201cAccolade Wine Investment\u201d) for A$149.1 million, or $113.6 million. We received cash proceeds, net of direct costs to sell, of $111.7 million. This interest consisted of an investment accounted for under the cost method and available-for-sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) debt securities. We recognized net gains of $0.4 million and $99.8 million in connection with this transaction for the years ended February 29, 2020, and February 28,2019, respectively. These net gains are included in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments.\nBusiness transformation\nWe have committed to a business transformation strategy which aligns our portfolio with consumer-led premiumization trends and growing segments of the Wine and Spirits and Beer markets.\nWine and Spirits Transaction\nIn April 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business, including approximately 30 lower-margin, lower-growth wine and spirits brands, wineries, vineyards, offices, and facilities (the \u201cWine and Spirits Transaction\u201d).\nNew Wine and Spirits Transactions\nIn December 2019, we agreed to revise and supersede the Wine and Spirits Transaction. The revisions to the transaction address competitive concerns raised by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) specifically related to the sparkling wine, brandy, dessert wine, and concentrate categories. As a result, the brands Cook\u2019s California Champagne, J. Roget American Champagne, Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy, and our concentrate business will be excluded from the transaction resulting in an adjusted transaction price of approximately $843 million, with the potential to earn an incremental $250 million of contingent consideration if certain brand performance provisions are met over a two-year period after closing (the \u201cRevised Wine and Spirits Transaction\u201d). The Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction is expected to close around the end of first quarter of fiscal 2021, and is subject to required regulatory clearances and governmental review and approval. Additionally, in a separate, but related, transaction, we agreed that upon execution and delivery of a definitive agreement for the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction, we would enter into an agreement to sell the New Zealand-based Nobilo Wine brand and certain related assets for $130 million (the \u201cNobilo Wine Transaction\u201d). The Nobilo Wine Transaction is expected to close by the end of second quarter of fiscal 2021 and is subject to FTC and New Zealand regulatory review and approval. Completion of the Nobilo Transaction is also conditioned on completion of the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction. We expect to use the net cash proceeds from the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction and the Nobilo Wine Transaction (collectively, the \u201cNew Wine and Spirits Transactions\u201d) primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings.\nWe have communicated our intent to retain the brands Cook\u2019s California Champagne and J. Roget American Champagne contemplated under the Wine and Spirits Transaction and the FTC is currently reviewing our business plans to support these brands in the future.\nOther Wine and Spirits Transactions\nWe are pursuing other opportunities to divest the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy brand and concentrate business excluded from the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction to companies with more aligned business strategies (the \u201cOther Wine and Spirits Transactions\u201d).\nBallast Point Transaction\nIn December 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Ballast Point craft beer business, including a number of its associated production facilities and brewpubs, (the \u201cBallast Point Transaction\u201d). See \u201cSubsequent Event - Divestiture\u201d below.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 76\nAssets held for sale\nIn contemplation of the transactions noted above, certain net assets have met the held for sale criteria as of February 29, 2020. For the year ended February 29, 2020, long-lived asset impairments of $449.7 million were recognized.

FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 78\nSubsequent event\nMexicali Brewery\nIn fiscal 2017, we began construction of a new, state-of-the-art brewery located in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico (the \u201cMexicali Brewery\u201d). In March 2020, a public consultation was held on the construction of the Mexicali Brewery. We have initiated early stage discussions with government officials in Mexico regarding next steps for our brewery construction project and options elsewhere in the country following the result of the public consultation. These discussions have been positive and we will continue working with government officials to mutually agree upon a path forward. In the medium-term, we have ample capacity, based on current growth forecasts and production capabilities at the Nava and Obregon breweries, to meet consumer needs. As of February 29, 2020, we recognized approximately $700 million of capital expenditures for construction in progress and had an additional $275 million of committed costs, a portion of which are included in purchase commitments as they have a remaining contract term greater than one year (see Note 17).\n6. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nOverview\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, and equity prices that could affect our results of operations and financial condition. The impact on our results and financial position and the amounts reported in our financial statements will vary based upon the currency, commodity, interest rate, and equity market movements during the period, the effectiveness and level of derivative instruments outstanding, and whether they are designated and qualify for hedge accounting.\nThe estimated fair values of our derivative instruments change with fluctuations in currency rates, commodity prices, interest rates, and/or equity prices and are expected to offset changes in the values of the underlying exposures. Our derivative instruments are held solely to manage our exposures to the aforementioned market risks as part of our normal business operations. We follow strict policies to manage these risks and do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe have investments in certain equity securities and other rights which provide us with the option to purchase an additional ownership interest in the equity securities of Canopy (see Note 10). These investments are included in securities measured at fair value and are accounted for at fair value, with the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of these investments recognized in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments (see Note 7).\nThe aggregate notional value of outstanding derivative instruments is as follows:\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\n(in millions)\nDerivative instruments designated as hedging instruments\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n1,831.0\n$\n1,579.3\nInterest rate swap contracts\n$\n375.0\n$\n-\nTreasury lock contracts\n$\n300.0\n$\n-\nDerivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n1,180.2\n$\n460.3\nCommodity derivative contracts\n$\n282.8\n$\n284.7\nCash flow hedges\nOur derivative instruments designated in hedge accounting relationships are designated as cash flow hedges. We are exposed to foreign denominated cash flow fluctuations primarily in connection with third party and intercompany sales and purchases. We primarily use foreign currency forward contracts\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 79\nto hedge certain of these risks. In addition, we utilize interest rate swap and treasury lock contracts periodically to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivatives managing our cash flow exposures generally mature within three years or less, with a maximum maturity of five years.\nTo qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the details of the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risk that is being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed, and how ineffectiveness will be measured. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the risk being hedged. Throughout the term of the designated cash flow hedge relationship on at least a quarterly basis, a retrospective evaluation and prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is performed based on quantitative and qualitative measures. All components of our derivative instruments\u2019 gains or losses are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\nWhen we determine that a derivative instrument which qualified for hedge accounting treatment has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. In the event the relationship is no longer effective, we recognize the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative instrument from the date the hedging derivative instrument became no longer effective immediately in our results of operations. We also discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (i) a derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (ii) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (iii) we determine that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, but the original forecasted transaction continues to be probable of occurring, the existing gain or loss of the derivative instrument remains in AOCI and is reclassified into earnings (losses) when the forecasted transaction occurs. When it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, any remaining gain or loss in AOCI is recognized immediately in our results of operations.\nWe expect $39.5 million of net gains, net of income tax effect, to be reclassified from AOCI to our results of operations within the next 12 months.\nUndesignated hedges\nCertain of our derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment; for others, we choose not to maintain the required documentation to apply hedge accounting treatment. These undesignated instruments are primarily used to economically hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables; foreign currency investments, primarily consisting of loans to subsidiaries and foreign-denominated investments, and cash flows related primarily to the repatriation of those loans or investments; and commodity prices, including aluminum, corn, diesel fuel, natural gas, and wheat prices. We primarily use foreign currency forward and option contracts, generally less than 12 months in duration, and commodity swap contracts, generally less than 36 months in duration, with a maximum maturity of five years, to hedge some of these risks. In addition, from time to time, we utilize interest rate swap contracts, generally less than six months in duration, to economically hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates associated with the financing of significant investments and acquisitions. Our derivative policy permits the use of undesignated derivatives as approved by senior management.\nCredit risk\nWe are exposed to credit-related losses if the counterparties to our derivative contracts default. This credit risk is limited to the fair value of the derivative contracts. To manage this risk, we contract only with major financial institutions that have earned investment-grade credit ratings and with whom we have standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements which allow for net settlement of the derivative contracts. We have also established counterparty credit guidelines that are regularly monitored. Because of these safeguards, we believe the risk of loss from counterparty default to be immaterial.\nIn addition, our derivative instruments are not subject to credit rating contingencies or collateral requirements.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nAuthoritative guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value, including a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy includes three levels:\n\u2022\nLevel 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n\u2022\nLevel 2 inputs include data points that are observable such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) such as volatility, interest\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 82\nrates and yield curves that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly; and\n\u2022\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.\nFair value methodology\nThe following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value for each class of our financial instruments:\nForeign currency and commodity derivative contracts\nThe fair value is estimated using market-based inputs, obtained from independent pricing services, entered into valuation models. These valuation models require various inputs, including contractual terms, market foreign exchange prices, market commodity prices, interest-rate yield curves, and currency volatilities, as applicable (Level 2 fair value measurement).\nInterest rate swap and treasury lock contracts\nThe fair value is estimated based on quoted market prices from respective counterparties. Quotes are corroborated by using discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interest-rate yield curves, which are obtained from independent pricing services (Level 2 fair value measurement).\nCanopy investments\nEquity securities, Warrants - The terms of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants were modified in June 2019 and now consist of three tranches of warrants: New Tranche A Warrants, New Tranche B Warrants, and New Tranche C Warrants. The exercise price for the New Tranche C Warrants is based on the volume-weighted average of the closing market price of Canopy\u2019s common shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange (\u201cTSX\u201d) for the five trading days immediately preceding the exercise date (\u201cVWAP Exercise Price\u201d), accordingly, no fair value is assigned.

We have elected the fair value option to account for the Canopy Debt Securities, which, at that time, provided the greatest level of consistency with the accounting treatment for the November 2017 Canopy Warrants. Interest income on the Canopy Debt Securities is calculated using the effective interest method and is recognized separately from the changes in fair value in interest expense. The Canopy Debt Securities have a contractual maturity of five years from the date of issuance, but may be converted prior to maturity by either party upon the occurrence of certain events. At settlement, the Canopy Debt Securities can be settled at the option of the issuer, in cash, equity shares of the issuer, or a combination thereof. The fair value is estimated using a binomial lattice option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement), which includes an estimate of the credit spread based on the implied spread as of the issuance date of the notes.\nThe inputs used to estimate the fair value of the Canopy Debt Securities are as follows:\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\nConversion price (1)\nC$\n48.17\nC$\n48.17\nValuation date stock price (2)\nC$\n25.17\nC$\n62.38\nRemaining term (3)\n3.4 years\n4.4 years\nExpected volatility (4)\n58.2\n%\n45.9\n%\nRisk-free interest rate (5)\n1.1\n%\n1.8\n%\nExpected dividend yield (6)\n0.0\n%\n0.0\n%\n(1)\nBased on the rate which the Canopy Debt Securities may be converted into equity shares, or the equivalent amount of cash, at the option of the issuer.\n(2)\nBased on the closing market price for Canopy common stock on the TSX as of the applicable date.\n(3)\nBased on the contractual maturity date of the notes.\n(4)\nBased on historical volatility levels of the underlying equity security reduced to account for certain risks not incorporated into the option-pricing model.\n(5)\nBased on the implied yield currently available on Canadian Treasury zero coupon issues with a term equal to the remaining contractual term of the debt securities.\n(6)\nBased on historical dividend levels.\nShort-term borrowings\nThe revolving credit facility under our senior credit facility is a variable interest rate bearing note which includes a fixed margin which is adjustable based upon our debt rating (as defined in our senior credit facility). Its fair value is estimated by discounting cash flows using LIBOR plus a margin reflecting current market conditions obtained from participating member financial institutions (Level 2 fair value measurement). The remaining instruments, including our commercial paper, are variable interest rate bearing notes for which the carrying value approximates the fair value.\nLong-term debt\nThe term loans under our Term Credit Agreement and 2019 Term Credit Agreement (both as defined in Note 13) are variable interest rate bearing notes which include a fixed margin which is adjustable based upon our debt rating. The senior floating rate notes are variable interest rate bearing notes which include a fixed margin. The fair value of the term loans and the senior floating rate notes are estimated by discounting cash flows using LIBOR plus a margin reflecting current market conditions obtained from participating member financial institutions (Level 2 fair value measurement). The fair value of the remaining long-term debt, which is primarily fixed interest rate, is estimated by discounting cash\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 84\nflows using interest rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities (Level 2 fair value measurement).\nThe carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings, approximate fair value as of February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. As of February 29, 2020, the carrying amount of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $11,945.7 million, compared with an estimated fair value of $12,935.9 million. As of February 28, 2019, the carrying amount of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $12,825.0 million, compared with an estimated fair value of $12,768.5 million.\nRecurring basis measurements\nThe following table presents our financial assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis:\nFair Value Measurements Using\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive\nMarkets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3)\nTotal\n(in millions)\nFebruary 29, 2020\nAssets:\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n-\n$\n96.3\n$\n-\n$\n96.3\nCommodity derivative contracts\n$\n-\n$\n0.6\n$\n-\n$\n0.6\nEquity securities (1)\n$\n-\n$\n991.5\n$\n-\n$\n991.5\nCanopy Debt Securities (1)\n$\n-\n$\n125.6\n$\n-\n$\n125.6\nLiabilities:\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n-\n$\n34.4\n$\n-\n$\n34.4\nCommodity derivative contracts\n$\n-\n$\n40.9\n$\n-\n$\n40.9\nInterest rate swap contracts\n$\n-\n$\n0.8\n$\n-\n$\n0.8\nTreasury lock contracts\n$\n-\n$\n7.6\n$\n-\n$\n7.6\nFebruary 28, 2019\nAssets:\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n-\n$\n38.2\n$\n-\n$\n38.2\nCommodity derivative contracts\n$\n-\n$\n8.7\n$\n-\n$\n8.7\nEquity securities (1)\n$\n-\n$\n3,023.2\n$\n-\n$\n3,023.2\nCanopy Debt Securities (1)\n$\n-\n$\n211.5\n$\n-\n$\n211.5\nLiabilities:\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n-\n$\n15.7\n$\n-\n$\n15.7\nCommodity derivative contracts\n$\n-\n$\n11.6\n$\n-\n$\n11.6\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

For the third quarter and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, in connection with the New Wine and Spirits Transactions, additional losses of $340.0 million and $20.0 million were recognized, respectively. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, in connection with the Other Wine and Spirits Transactions, long-lived assets held for sale were written down to their estimated fair value, less costs to sell, resulting in a loss of $20.0 million. Of the total Wine and Spirits segment long-lived assets held for sale with a carrying value of $1,479.4 million, $1,291.2 million were written down to their current estimated fair value of $908.2 million, less costs to sell, resulting in a total loss of $407.0 million for the year ended February 29, 2020. This loss is included in impairment of assets held for sale. These assets consisted primarily of goodwill, intangible assets, and certain winery and vineyard assets which had satisfied the conditions necessary to be classified as held for sale. Our estimate of fair value was\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 86\ndetermined based on the expected proceeds from the New Wine and Spirits Transactions and Other Wine and Spirits Transactions, excluding the contingent consideration, which we will recognize when it is determined to be realizable.\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2020, in connection with the Ballast Point Transaction, long-lived assets held for sale were written down to their estimated fair value, less costs to sell, resulting in a loss of $50.0 million. Subsequently, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, a reduction to the loss on long-lived assets held for sale of $7.3 million was recognized. The long-lived assets held for sale with a carrying value of $77.8 million were written down to their estimated fair value of $41.1 million, less costs to sell. As a result, a loss of $42.7 million, inclusive of costs to sell and other losses is included in impairment of assets held for sale for the year ended February 29, 2020. These assets consisted primarily of intangible assets and certain production and warehouse assets which had satisfied the conditions necessary to be classified as held for sale. Our estimate of fair value was determined based on the expected proceeds from the Ballast Point Transaction. The Ballast Point craft beer portfolio is a component of the Beer segment and was included in our beer reporting unit. Accordingly, goodwill was allocated to the Ballast Point craft beer portfolio assets held for sale based on the relative fair value of the business being sold compared to the relative fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill not allocated to assets held for sale remains in the beer reporting unit.\nTrademarks\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2020, certain continuing negative trends within our Beer segment\u2019s Ballast Point craft beer portfolio, including increased rate of revenue decline and increased competition, indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the Ballast Point craft beer trademarks might be below its carrying value. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment. As a result of this assessment, the Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset with a carrying value of $28.0 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $17.0 million, resulting in an impairment of $11.0 million. This impairment is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended February 29, 2020. The Ballast Point craft beer trademarks have been reclassified to assets held for sale as of February 29, 2020.\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, in connection with certain continuing negative trends within our Beer segment\u2019s Ballast Point craft beer portfolio, including slower growth rates and increased competition, we implemented a change in strategy for our Ballast Point craft beer portfolio. This change in strategy, when combined with the continuing negative trends, indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset associated with the craft beer trademarks might be below its carrying value. The change in strategy for our Ballast Point craft beer portfolio focuses on improving profitability by rationalizing the number of product offerings while targeting distribution growth in select strategic markets. This change in strategy resulted in updated long-term financial forecasts with lower revenues, and cash flows for the related portfolio. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment of the Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset. As a result of this assessment, the Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset with a carrying value of $136.0 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $28.0 million, resulting in an impairment of $108.0 million.\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we identified certain negative trends within our Beer segment\u2019s Ballast Point craft beer portfolio which, when combined with the then-recent negative craft beer industry trends, including slower growth rates and increased competition, indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset associated with the craft beer trademarks might be below its carrying value. These negative trends were the result of (i) a disruption in our distribution network transition plan, (ii) an unexpected decrease in sales from product innovations, and (iii) a significant shift in market conditions for our craft beer portfolio, all of which resulted in a decline in net sales and depletion trends, which represent distributor shipments of our branded products to retail customers, for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Additionally, net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were below our forecasted net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment of the craft beer trademark asset. As a result of this assessment, the craft beer trademark asset with a carrying value of\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 87\n$222.8 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $136.0 million, resulting in an impairment of $86.8 million.\nWhen performing a quantitative assessment for impairment of a trademark asset, we measure the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of the trademark asset exceeds its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is determined based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method, which assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of the trademark asset. The cash flow projections we use to estimate the fair value of our trademark assets involve several assumptions, including (i) projected revenue growth rates, (ii) estimated royalty rates, (iii) after-tax royalty savings expected from ownership of the trademarks, and (iv) discount rates used to derive the estimated fair value of the trademark assets.\n8.

The November 2017 Canopy Warrants have been accounted for at fair value from the date of investment.\nOn November 1, 2018, we increased our ownership interest in Canopy by acquiring an additional 104.5 million common shares (the \u201cNovember 2018 Canopy Investment\u201d) (see Canopy Equity Method Investment below), plus warrants which give us the option to purchase an additional 139.7 million common shares of Canopy (the \u201cNovember 2018 Canopy Warrants\u201d, and together with the November 2018 Canopy Investment, the \u201cNovember 2018 Canopy Transaction\u201d) for C$5,078.7 million, or $3,869.9 million.\nOn November 1, 2018, our ownership interest in Canopy increased to 36.6% which allows us to exercise significant influence, but not control, over Canopy. Therefore, we account for the November 2017 Canopy Investment and the November 2018 Canopy Investment, each of which represents an investment in common shares of Canopy, collectively, under the equity method (the \u201cCanopy Equity Method Investment\u201d). We recognize equity in earnings (losses) and related activities for this investment on a two-month lag. Accordingly, we recognized equity in earnings (losses) and related activities of $(575.9) million for the period January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019, in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended February 29, 2020, and $(2.6) million for the period November 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018, in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended February 28, 2019. Equity in earnings (losses) from the Canopy Equity Method Investment and related activities for the years ended February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, include, among other items, the amortization of the fair value adjustments associated with the definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, the flow through of inventory step-up, and unrealized gains (losses) associated with changes in our Canopy ownership percentage resulting from periodic equity issuances made by Canopy. In addition to the items noted above, the year ended February 29, 2020, includes our share of the additional loss resulting from the June 2019 Warrant Modification (as defined below) of $(409.0) million (the \u201cJune 2019 Warrant Modification Loss\u201d).\nThe November 2018 Canopy Warrants originally consisted of 88.5 million warrants (the \u201cTranche A Warrants\u201d) and 51.2 million warrants (the \u201cTranche B Warrants\u201d). The Tranche A Warrants were immediately exercisable at an exercise price of C$50.40 per warrant share. The Tranche B Warrants were exercisable upon the exercise, in full, of the Tranche A Warrants and at an exercise price based on the volume-weighted average of the closing market price of Canopy\u2019s common shares on the TSX for the five trading days immediately preceding the exercise date. The November 2018 Canopy Warrants originally expired in November 2021 and have been accounted for at fair value from the date of investment.\nIn June 2019, the Canopy shareholders approved the modification of the terms of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants and certain other rights (the \u201cJune 2019 Warrant Modification\u201d), and the other required approvals necessary for the modifications to be effective were granted. These changes are the result of Canopy\u2019s intention to acquire Acreage Holdings, Inc. (\u201cAcreage\u201d) upon U.S. Federal cannabis legalization, subject to certain conditions (the \u201cAcreage Transaction\u201d). As a result of the modifications, we continue to have the option to purchase an additional 139.7 million common shares of Canopy upon exercise of the warrants originally received in November 2018; however, this option now consists of three tranches of warrants, including 88.5 million warrants (the \u201cNew Tranche A Warrants\u201d), 38.4 million warrants (the \u201cNew Tranche B Warrants\u201d), and 12.8 million warrants (the \u201cNew Tranche C Warrants\u201d, and collectively with the New Tranche A Warrants and the New Tranche B Warrants, the \u201cNew November 2018 Canopy Warrants\u201d). The New Tranche A Warrants have an exercise price of C$50.40 per warrant share and are currently exercisable, but now expire November 1, 2023. The New Tranche B Warrants now have an exercise price of C$76.68 per warrant share and the New Tranche C Warrants have a VWAP Exercise\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 90\nPrice. The New Tranche B Warrants and the New Tranche C Warrants now have an expiration date of November 1, 2026.\nThe other rights obtained in June 2019 in connection with the Acreage Transaction include a share repurchase credit and the ability to purchase Canopy common shares on the open market or in private agreement transactions. If for any reason Canopy has not purchased the lesser of 27,378,866 Canopy common shares or C$1,583.0 million worth of Canopy common shares for cancellation between April 18, 2019 and two-years after the full exercise of the New Tranche A Warrants, we will be credited an amount that will reduce the aggregate exercise price otherwise payable upon each exercise of the New Tranche B Warrants and New Tranche C Warrants. The credit will be an amount equal to the difference between the actual price paid by Canopy in purchasing its common shares for cancellation and C$1,583.0 million. If we choose to purchase Canopy common shares on the open market or in private agreement with existing holders, the number of New Tranche B Warrants or New Tranche C Warrants shall be decreased by one for each Canopy common share acquired, up to an aggregate maximum reduction of 20 million warrants. The likelihood of receiving the share repurchase credit if we were to fully exercise the New Tranche A Warrants is remote, therefore, no fair value has been assigned.\nThe inputs used to estimate the fair value of the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants as of the June 27, 2019 modification date, are as follows:\nNew\nTranche A Warrants (1)\nNew\nTranche B Warrants (1)\nExercise price\nC$\n50.40\nC$\n76.68\nValuation date stock price\nC$\n53.36\nC$\n53.36\nRemaining contractual term\n4.3 years\n7.3 years\nExpected volatility\n66.7\n%\n66.7\n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n1.4\n%\n1.4\n%\nExpected dividend yield\n0.0\n%\n0.0\n%\n(1)\nRefer to Note 7 for input descriptions.\nAccordingly, we recognized a $1,176.0 million unrealized gain from unconsolidated investments in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 from the June 2019 Warrant Modification. Approximately $322.5 million of the unrealized gain was associated with the New Tranche A Warrants and $853.5 million was associated with the New Tranche B Warrants. No value was associated with the New Tranche C Warrants as they have a VWAP Exercise Price. As the expiration dates of the New Tranche A Warrants and New Tranche B Warrants were extended, we now utilize a blend of Canopy\u2019s historical volatility, implied volatility, and limited consideration of historical peer group volatility in our valuations to supplement the limited trading history.\nCanopy has various convertible equity securities outstanding, including primarily equity awards granted to its employees and options and warrants issued to various third parties, including our November 2017 Canopy Warrants, New November 2018 Canopy Warrants, Canopy Debt Securities, and the Acreage Call Option (as defined below). As of February 29, 2020, the conversion of Canopy equity securities held by its employees and/or held by other third parties, excluding our November 2017 Canopy Warrants, New November 2018 Canopy Warrants, Canopy Debt Securities, and the Acreage Call Option, would not have a significant effect on our share of Canopy\u2019s reported earnings or losses. Additionally, under an amended and restated investor rights agreement, we have the option to purchase additional common shares of Canopy at the then-current price of the underlying equity security to allow us to maintain our relative ownership interest. If we exercised all of our outstanding November 2017 Canopy Warrants and New November 2018 Canopy Warrants, it could have a significant effect on our share of Canopy\u2019s reported earnings or losses and our ownership interest in Canopy would be expected to increase to greater than 50 percent. In connection with the Acreage Transaction, Canopy has a call option to acquire 100% of the shares of Acreage (the \u201cAcreage Call Option\u201d), which would require the issuance of\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 91\nCanopy shares. If Canopy exercised the Acreage Call Option it could have a significant effect on our share of Canopy\u2019s reported earnings or losses and our ownership interest in Canopy would decrease and no longer be expected to be greater than 50 percent.\nAs of February 29, 2020, the exercise of all Canopy warrants held by us would have required a cash outflow of approximately $6.0 billion based on the terms of the November 2017 Canopy Warrants and the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants. Additionally, as of February 29, 2020, the fair value of the Canopy Equity Method Investment was $2,316.3 million based on the closing price of the underlying equity security as of that date. When compared to the carrying value of the Canopy Equity Method Investment, this fair value indicates that the investment was impaired by $595.4 million. We have evaluated the Canopy Equity Method Investment as of February 29, 2020, and determined that there was not an other-than-temporary-impairment. Our conclusion was based on several contributing factors, including: (i) the period of time for which the fair value has been less than the carrying value, (ii) an expectation that Canopy\u2019s operating results will improve, (iii) an expectation that the Canopy stock price will recover in the near term, and (iv) our ability and intent to hold the investment until that recovery. We will continue to review the Canopy Equity Method Investment for an other-than-temporary-impairment. There may be a future impairment of our Canopy Equity Method Investment if Canopy\u2019s stock price does not recover in the near term or our expectations about Canopy\u2019s prospective operating results and cash flows decline, which could be influenced by a variety of factors including adverse market conditions and the economic impact of COVID-19.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information for Canopy presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We recognize our equity in earnings (losses) for Canopy on a two-month lag. Accordingly, we recognized our share of Canopy\u2019s earnings (losses) for the period January through December 2019 in our year ended February 29, 2020 results. We recognized our share of Canopy\u2019s earnings (losses) from November and December 2018, in our year ended February 28, 2019 results. The amounts shown represent 100% of Canopy\u2019s financial position and results of operations, however, they exclude the impact of the June 2019 Warrant Modification Loss from the year ended February 29, 2020 results, as it was recorded by Canopy within equity.\nFebruary 29, 2020\nFebruary 28, 2019\n(in millions)\nCurrent assets\n$\n2,232.9\n$\n3,800.7\nNoncurrent assets\n$\n3,751.6\n$\n2,466.0\nCurrent liabilities\n$\n322.0\n$\n216.8\nNoncurrent liabilities\n$\n867.9\n$\n668.2\nNoncontrolling interests\n$\n210.5\n$\n143.3\nFor the Years Ended\nFebruary 29, 2020\nFebruary 28, 2019 (1)\n(in millions)\nNet sales\n$\n290.2\n$\n48.6\nGross profit (loss)\n$\n45.4\n$\n11.2\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(327.0\n)\n$\n(39.6\n)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Canopy\n$\n(312.6\n)\n$\n(27.8\n)\n(1)\nFor the period November 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018.\nSubsequent event\nIn March 2020, Canopy announced its plans to close two Canadian greenhouse facilities as part of its efforts to align supply and demand while improving production efficiencies over time. In April 2020, Canopy announced its plans to close an additional Canadian greenhouse facility, exit its operations in\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 92\nAfrica, and reduce Latin America and United States cultivation activities. Canopy expects to record an estimated pre-tax loss of approximately C$700 million to C$800 million in their fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 results from the facilities closures as well as other changes related to its organizational and strategic review. We will record our proportional share of Canopy\u2019s estimated pre-tax loss of approximately C$245 million to C$280 million, in our first quarter of fiscal 2021 results.\n11.

The principal changes effected by the 2017 Restatement Agreement were:\n\u2022\nThe refinance and increase of the existing U.S. Term A-1 loan facility by $261.1 million to $500.0 million and extension of its maturity to July 14, 2024;\n\u2022\nThe creation of a new $2.0 billion European Term A loan facility into which the then-existing European Term A loan facility, European Term A-1 loan facility, and European Term A-2 loan facility were combined;\n\u2022\nThe increase of the revolving credit facility by $350.0 million to $1.5 billion and extension of its maturity to July 14, 2022; and\n\u2022\nThe removal of CIHH as a borrower under the 2017 Restatement Agreement.\nIn addition, the Company and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries executed an amended and restated guarantee agreement which, among other things, released certain of our U.S. subsidiaries as guarantors of borrowings under the 2017 Credit Agreement. Furthermore, the European Borrowers executed an amended and restated cross-guarantee agreement which, among other things, removed CIHH as a party to the amended and restated cross-guarantee agreement.\nIn November 2017, we repaid the outstanding obligations under the European Term A loan facility under the 2017 Credit Agreement primarily with proceeds from the November 2017 senior notes.\nIn August 2018, the Company, CIH, CB International, certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries as guarantors, the Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders entered into a Restatement Agreement (the \u201cAugust 2018 Restatement Agreement\u201d) that amended and restated the 2017 Credit Agreement (as amended and restated by the August 2018 Restatement Agreement, the \u201cAugust 2018 Credit Agreement\u201d). The principal changes effected by the August 2018 Restatement Agreement were:\n\u2022\nThe removal of CIH as a borrower under the August 2018 Credit Agreement;\n\u2022\nThe termination of a cross-guarantee agreement by the European Borrowers; and\n\u2022\nThe addition of a mechanism to provide for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative benchmark rate in certain circumstances where LIBOR cannot be adequately ascertained or available.\nIn September 2018, the Company, CB International, certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries as guarantors, the Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders entered into a Restatement Agreement (the \u201c2018 Restatement Agreement\u201d) that amended and restated the August 2018 Credit Agreement (as amended and restated by the 2018 Restatement Agreement, the \u201c2018 Credit Agreement\u201d). The primary change effected by the 2018 Restatement Agreement was the increase of the revolving credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion and extension of its maturity to September 14, 2023. The 2018 Restatement Agreement also modified certain financial covenants in connection with the November 2018 Canopy Transaction and added various representations and warranties, covenants, and an event of default related to the November 2018 Canopy Transaction.\nIn June 2019, we repaid the outstanding obligations under the U.S. Term A-1 loan facility under the 2018 Credit Agreement with proceeds from the 2019 Term Credit Agreement (as defined below).\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 94\nTerm Credit Agreement\nIn September 2018, the Company, the Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders entered into a term loan credit agreement (the \u201cTerm Credit Agreement\u201d). The Term Credit Agreement provides for aggregate credit facilities of $1.5 billion, consisting of a $500.0 million three-year term loan facility (the \u201cThree-Year Term Facility\u201d) and a $1.0 billion five-year term loan facility (the \u201cFive-Year Term Facility\u201d).\nThe Three-Year Term Facility is not subject to amortization payments, with the balance due and payable at maturity. The Five-Year Term Facility will be repaid in quarterly payments of principal equal to 1.25% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Five-Year Term Facility, with the balance due and payable at maturity.\n2019 Term Credit Agreement\nIn June 2019, the Company and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and lender (the \u201cLender\u201d) entered into a term loan credit agreement (the \u201c2019 Term Credit Agreement\u201d). The 2019 Term Credit Agreement provides for the creation of a $491.3 million five-year term loan facility (the \u201c2019 Five-Year Term Facility\u201d). The 2019 Five-Year Term Facility will be repaid in quarterly payments of principal equal to 1.25% of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Five-Year Term Facility, with the balance due and payable at maturity.\nGeneral\nThe obligations under the 2018 Credit Agreement, the Term Credit Agreement, and the 2019 Term Credit Agreement were guaranteed by certain of our U.S. subsidiaries. We and our subsidiaries are subject to covenants that are contained in the 2018 Credit Agreement, the Term Credit Agreement, and the 2019 Term Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness) by subsidiaries that are not guarantors, additional liens, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions, and thresholds. The financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net leverage ratio.\nOur senior credit facility permits us to elect, subject to the willingness of existing or new lenders to fund such increase or term loans and other customary conditions, to increase the revolving credit commitments or add one or more tranches of additional term loans (the \u201cIncremental Facilities\u201d). The Incremental Facilities may be an unlimited amount so long as our leverage ratio, as defined and computed pursuant to our senior credit facility, is no greater than 4.00 to 1.00 subject to certain limitations for the period defined pursuant to our senior credit facility.\nThe 2018 Credit Agreement, the Term Credit Agreement and the 2019 Term Credit Agreement were subsequently amended as described below.\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

Our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the amount available under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 Credit Agreement. As of February 29, 2020, we had $238.9 million of outstanding borrowings, net of unamortized discount, under our commercial paper program with a weighted average annual interest rate of 1.9% and a weighted average remaining term of 8 days.

As of February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, amounts outstanding under these arrangements were $25.3 million and $28.9 million, respectively, the majority of which is classified as long-term as of the respective date. These arrangements primarily support the financing needs of our domestic and foreign subsidiary operations (see \u201cOther long-term debt\u201d for\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

The TCJ Act significantly changes U.S. corporate income taxes by, among other items, lowering the federal statutory rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax, and imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In December 2017, the SEC issued guidance related to the income tax accounting implications of the TCJ Act. This guidance provides a measurement period, which extends no longer than one year from the\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 100\nenactment date of the TCJ Act, during which a company may complete its accounting for the income tax implications of the TCJ Act. In accordance with this guidance, we recognized a provisional net income tax benefit of $351.2 million for the year ended February 28, 2018. This amount is comprised primarily of (i) a benefit of $311.2 million from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new, lower federal statutory rate and (ii) a benefit of $220.0 million from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities previously provided for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries which were not considered to be indefinitely reinvested; partially offset by the recording of the mandatory one-time transition tax of $180.0 million on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed our analysis of the income tax implications of the TCJ Act. We recognized an additional income tax benefit of $37.6 million resulting from a decrease in the mandatory one-time transition tax on unremitted earnings of our foreign businesses.\nA reconciliation of the total tax provision (benefit) to the amount computed by applying the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before provision for (benefit from) income taxes is as follows:\nFor the Years Ended\nFebruary 29, 2020\nFebruary 28, 2019\nFebruary 28, 2018\nAmount\n% of\nPretax\nIncome (Loss)\nAmount\n% of\nPretax\nIncome (Loss)\nAmount\n% of\nPretax\nIncome (Loss)\n(in millions, except % of pretax income (loss) data)\nIncome tax provision (benefit) at statutory rate\n$\n(198.5\n)\n21.0\n%\n$\n870.5\n21.0\n%\n$\n765.4\n32.7\n%\nState and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit (1)\n(82.3\n)\n8.7\n%\n81.3\n2.0\n%\n18.0\n0.8\n%\nNet income tax provision (benefit) from legislative changes (2)\n(547.4\n)\n57.9\n%\n(37.6\n)\n(0.9\n%)\n(351.2\n)\n(15.0\n%)\nEarnings taxed at other than U.S. statutory rate (3)\n(46.5\n)\n5.0\n%\n(81.0\n)\n(1.9\n%)\n(323.9\n)\n(13.9\n%)\nExcess tax benefits from stock-based compensation awards (4)\n(56.2\n)\n5.9\n%\n(82.9\n)\n(2.0\n%)\n(68.6\n)\n(2.9\n%)\nNet income tax provision (benefit) recognized for adjustment to valuation allowance\n(32.8\n)\n3.5\n%\n(74.1\n)\n(1.8\n%)\n4.8\n0.2\n%\nMiscellaneous items, net\n(2.9\n)\n0.3\n%\n9.7\n0.1\n%\n(21.8\n)\n(0.9\n%)\nIncome tax provision (benefit) at effective rate\n$\n(966.6\n)\n102.3\n%\n$\n685.9\n16.5\n%\n$\n22.7\n1.0\n%\n(1)\nIncludes differences resulting from adjustments to the current and deferred state effective tax rates.\n(2)\nThe year ended February 29, 2020, represents the recognition of a net income tax benefit resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets in connection with the September 2019 enactment of tax reform in Switzerland.

In making this assessment, we consider the projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income as well as tax planning strategies. Based upon this assessment, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of any valuation allowances.\nAs of February 29, 2020, operating loss carryforwards, which are primarily state and foreign, totaling $1.5 billion are being carried forward in a number of jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. Of these operating loss carryforwards, $1.4 billion will expire in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2040 and $87.4 million of operating losses in certain jurisdictions may be carried forward indefinitely. Additionally, as of February 29, 2020, federal capital losses totaling $173.2 million are being carried forward and will expire in fiscal 2022.\nWe have recognized valuation allowances for operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, and other deferred tax assets when we believe it is more likely than not that these items will not be realized. The decrease in our valuation allowances as of February 29, 2020, primarily relates to the reversal of valuation allowances for capital loss carryforwards in connection with the Wine and Spirits Transaction.\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

These liabilities are recorded as non-current as payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date.\nAs of February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, we had $249.4 million and $224.3 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefit liabilities that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate in the year of resolution.\nWe file U.S. Federal income tax returns and various state, local, and foreign income tax returns. Major tax jurisdictions where we are subject to examination by tax authorities include Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, and the U.S. Various U.S. Federal, state and foreign income tax examinations are currently in progress. It is reasonably possible that the liability associated with our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities will increase or decrease within the next twelve months as a result of these examinations or the expiration of statutes of limitation. As of February 29, 2020, we estimate that unrecognized tax benefit liabilities could change by a range of $1 million to $19 million. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. Federal, state, local, or foreign income tax examinations for fiscal years prior to February 28, 2013.\nWe provide for additional tax expense based on probable outcomes of ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. While it is often difficult to predict the outcome or the timing of resolution of any tax matter, we believe the reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash.\n15.

FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 103\n16. LEASES\nGeneral\nWe primarily lease certain vineyards, office and production facilities, warehouses, production equipment, and vehicles. We assess service arrangements to determine if an asset is explicitly or implicitly specified in the agreement and if we have the right to control the use of the identified asset. We have concluded that certain grape purchasing arrangements associated with the purchase of grape production yielded from a specified block of a vineyard and certain third-party logistics arrangements contain a lease.\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is primarily comprised of the initial amount of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs and lease payments at or before the lease commencement date, less any lease incentives received, and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term. All right-of-use assets are reviewed periodically for impairment. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, our secured incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rates are determined using a portfolio approach based on publicly available information in connection with our unsecured borrowing rates adjusted for items including collateral, currency, and the timing in which lease payments are made. We elected to recognize expenses for leases with a term of 12 months or less on a straight-line basis over the lease term and not to recognize these short-term leases on the balance sheet.\nOur leases have varying terms with remaining lease terms of up to approximately 30 years. Certain of our lease arrangements provide us with the option to extend or to terminate the lease early.\nThe right-of-use asset and lease liability are calculated including options to extend or to terminate the lease when we determine that it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options. In making that determination, we consider various existing economic and market factors, business strategies as well as the nature, length, and terms of the agreement. Based on our evaluation using these factors, we concluded that the exercise of renewal options or early termination options would not be reasonably certain in determining the lease term at commencement for leases we currently have in place. Assumptions made at the commencement date are re-evaluated upon occurrence of certain events such as a lease modification.\nCertain of our contractual arrangements may contain both lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components are distinct elements of a contract that are not related to securing the use of the leased asset, such as raw materials, common area maintenance, and other management costs. We elected to measure the lease liability by combining the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all asset classes.\nCertain of our leases include variable lease payments, including payments that depend on an index or rate, as well as variable payments for items such as raw materials, labor, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other operating expenses associated with leased assets. Certain grape purchasing arrangements include variable payments based on actual tonnage and price of grapes that will vary depending on certain factors, including weather, time of harvest, overall market conditions, and the agricultural practices and location of the vineyard. In addition, certain third-party logistics arrangements include variable payments that vary depending on throughput. Such variable lease payments are excluded from the calculation of the right-of-use asset and are recognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred.\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nPurchase commitments and contingencies\nWe have entered into various long-term contracts in the normal course of business for the purchase of (i) certain inventory components, (ii) property, plant, and equipment and related contractor and manufacturing services, (iii) processing and warehousing services, (iv) transportation services, and (v) certain energy requirements. As of February 29, 2020, the estimated aggregate minimum purchase commitments under these contracts are as follows:\nType\nLength of Commitment\nAmount\n(in millions)\nRaw materials and supplies (1)\nPackaging, grapes, hops, malts, and other raw materials\nthrough December 2037\n$\n4,789.5\nIn-process inventories\nBulk wine and spirits\nthrough April 2025\n85.8\nContract services\nProcessing and warehousing services, transportation services, and energy contracts\nthrough December 2030\n657.2\nCapital expenditures (2)\nProperty, plant, and equipment and contractor and manufacturing services\nthrough April 2022\n459.6\nOther\nFinished wine case goods\nthrough May 2029\n32.6\n$\n6,024.7\n(1)\nCertain grape purchasing arrangements include the purchase of grape production yielded from specified blocks of a vineyard. The actual tonnage and price of grapes that we purchase will vary each year depending on certain factors, including weather, time of harvest, overall market conditions, and the agricultural practices and location of the vineyard. Amounts included herein for the estimated aggregate minimum grape purchase commitments consist of estimates for the purchase of the grapes and the implicit leases of the land. Upon adoption of the new lease guidance on March 1, 2019, certain grape purchasing arrangements classified as leases have not resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet due to their variable nature.\n(2)\nConsists of purchase commitments entered into primarily in connection with the construction of the Mexicali Brewery, and the expansion project for the brewery located in Obregon, Sonora, Mexico (the \u201cObregon Brewery\u201d).\nAdditionally, we have entered into various contractual arrangements with affiliates of Owens-Illinois primarily for the purchase of glass bottles used largely in our imported and craft beer portfolios. Amounts purchased under these arrangements for the years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019, and February 28, 2018, were $166.6 million, $238.8 million, and $316.6 million, respectively.\nIndemnification liabilities\nIn connection with prior divestitures, we have indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise subsequent to the divestiture. As of February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, these liabilities consist primarily of indemnifications related to certain income tax matters. During the year ended February 28, 2019, in connection with the sale of the Accolade Wine Investment, we were released from certain guarantees and we recognized a gain of $3.7 million as part of the net gain on the sale of this business. This net gain is included in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments. As of February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, the carrying amount of our indemnification liabilities was $9.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively, and is included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities. We do not expect to be required to make material payments under the indemnifications and we believe that the likelihood is remote that the indemnifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.\nLegal matters\nIn the course of our business, we are subject to litigation from time to time. Although the amount of any liability with respect to such litigation cannot be determined, in the opinion of management, such\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 107\nliability will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOther\nIn connection with the write-down of certain bulk wine inventory as a result of smoke damage sustained during the Fall 2017 California wildfires, we have recognized total losses of $20.6 million, with $1.5 million recognized for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and $19.1 million recognized for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020 we recovered $8.6 million from our insurance carriers and do not expect to receive any additional reimbursement.\n18. STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nCommon stock\nWe have two classes of common stock with a material number of shares outstanding: Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock. Class B Convertible Common Stock shares are convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis at any time at the option of the holder. Holders of Class B Convertible Common Stock are entitled to ten votes per share. Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and a cash dividend premium. If we pay a cash dividend on Class B Convertible Common Stock, each share of Class A Common Stock will receive an amount at least ten percent greater than the amount of the cash dividend per share paid on Class B Convertible Common Stock. In addition, the Board of Directors may declare and pay a dividend on Class A Common Stock without paying any dividend on Class B Convertible Common Stock. However, our senior credit facility limits the cash dividends that we can pay on our common stock to a fixed amount per quarter but the fixed amount may be exceeded subject to various conditions set forth in the senior credit facility.\nIn addition, we have a class of common stock with an immaterial number of shares outstanding: Class 1 Common Stock. Shares of Class 1 Common Stock generally have no voting rights. Class 1 Common Stock shares are convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis at any time at the option of the holder, provided that the holder immediately sells the Class A Common Stock acquired upon conversion. Because shares of Class 1 Common Stock are convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock, for each share of Class 1 Common Stock issued, we must reserve one share of Class A Common Stock for issuance upon the conversion of the share of Class 1 Common Stock. Holders of Class 1 Common Stock do not have any preference as to dividends, but may participate in any dividend if and when declared by the Board of Directors. If we pay a cash dividend on Class 1 Common Stock, each share of Class A Common Stock will receive an amount at least ten percent greater than the amount of cash dividend per share paid on Class 1 Common Stock. In addition, the Board of Directors may declare and pay a dividend on Class A Common Stock without paying a dividend on Class 1 Common Stock. The cash dividends declared and paid on Class B Convertible Common Stock and Class 1 Common Stock must always be the same.\nThe number of shares of common stock issued and treasury stock, and associated share activity, are as follows:\nCommon Stock\nTreasury Stock\nClass A\nClass B\nClass 1\nClass A\nClass B\nBalance at February 28, 2017\n257,506,184\n28,358,527\n2,080\n86,262,971\n5,005,800\nShare repurchases\n-\n-\n-\n4,810,061\n-\nConversion of shares\n29,640\n(23,140\n)\n(6,500\n)\n-\n-\nExercise of stock options\n1,182,532\n-\n6,390\n-\n-\nEmployee stock purchases\n-\n-\n-\n(75,023\n)\n-\nGrant of restricted stock awards\n-\n-\n-\n(3,848\n)\n-\nVesting of restricted stock units (1)\n-\n-\n-\n(181,994\n)\n-\nVesting of performance share units (1)\n-\n-\n-\n(68,928\n)\n-\nBalance at February 28, 2018\n258,718,356\n28,335,387\n1,970\n90,743,239\n5,005,800\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 109\n19. STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION\nWe have two stock-based employee compensation plans (as further discussed below).

The aggregate number of shares of our Class A Common Stock and Class 1 Common Stock available for awards under our Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan is 108,000,000 shares.\nThe exercise price, vesting period, and term of nonqualified stock options granted are established by the committee administering the plan (the \u201cCommittee\u201d). The exercise price of any nonqualified stock option may not be less than the fair market value of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. Nonqualified stock options generally vest and become exercisable over a four-year period from the date of grant and expire as established by the Committee, but not later than ten years after the grant date.\nGrants of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units, and other stock-based awards may contain such vesting periods, terms, conditions, and other requirements as the Committee may establish. Restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards are based on service and generally vest over one to four years from the date of grant. Performance share unit awards are based on service and the satisfaction of certain performance conditions, and vest over a required employee service period, generally from one to three years from the date of grant, which closely matches the performance period. The performance conditions include the achievement of specified financial or operational performance metrics, or market conditions which require the achievement of specified levels of shareholder return relative to other companies as defined in the applicable performance share unit agreement. The actual number of shares to be awarded upon vesting of a performance share unit award will range between 0% and 200% of the target award, based upon the measure of performance as certified by the Committee.\nA summary of stock option activity under our Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan is as follows:\nFor the Years Ended\nFebruary 29, 2020\nFebruary 28, 2019\nFebruary 28, 2018\nNumber\nof\nOptions\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nNumber\nof\nOptions\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nNumber\nof\nOptions\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nOutstanding as of March 1\n5,691,219\n$\n81.87\n7,444,701\n$\n56.33\n8,070,255\n$\n44.31\nGranted\n639,957\n$\n206.76\n540,640\n$\n227.91\n624,121\n$\n172.70\nExercised\n(1,618,484\n)\n$\n41.77\n(2,156,508\n)\n$\n23.55\n(1,188,922\n)\n$\n31.86\nForfeited\n(175,917\n)\n$\n201.44\n(133,250\n)\n$\n187.84\n(59,725\n)\n$\n136.08\nExpired\n(11,357\n)\n$\n224.07\n(4,364\n)\n$\n175.86\n(1,028\n)\n$\n36.13\nOutstanding as of last day of February\n4,525,418\n$\n108.87\n5,691,219\n$\n81.87\n7,444,701\n$\n56.33\nExercisable\n3,330,164\n$\n75.61\n4,456,486\n$\n53.18\n5,983,286\n$\n34.12\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK\nNet sales to our five largest customers represented 32.5%, 32.7%, and 32.5% of our net sales for the years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019, and February 28, 2018, respectively. Net sales to our five largest customers are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues. Net sales to an individual customer which amount to 10% or more of our net sales, and the associated amounts receivable from this customer as a percentage of our accounts receivable, are as follows:\nFor the Years Ended\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\nFebruary 28,\nSouthern Glazer\u2019s Wine and Spirits\nNet sales\n10.5\n%\n12.9\n%\n13.0\n%\nAccounts receivable\n27.2\n%\n30.8\n%\n28.1\n%\nNet sales for the above customer are primarily reported within the Wine and Spirits segment. Our arrangements with certain of our customers may, generally, be terminated by either party with prior notice. The majority of our accounts receivable balance is generated from sales to independent distributors with whom we have a predetermined collection date arranged through electronic funds transfer. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers\u2019 financial position, and management is of the opinion that any risk of significant loss is reduced due to the diversity of our customers and geographic sales area.\n23. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThrough February 28, 2019, our internal management financial reporting consisted of two business divisions: (i) Beer and (ii) Wine and Spirits. Beginning March 1, 2019, as a result of our November 2018 Canopy Investment and a change in our chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) on March 1, 2019, we have changed our internal management financial reporting to consist of three business divisions: (i) Beer, (ii) Wine and Spirits, and (iii) Canopy. Consequently, beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we report our operating results in four segments: (i) Beer, (ii) Wine and Spirits, (iii) Corporate Operations and Other, and (iv) Canopy. The Canopy Equity Method Investment makes up the Canopy segment.\nIn the Beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported beer, craft beer, and alternative beverage alcohol brands. We have an exclusive perpetual brand license to import, market, and sell in the U.S. our Mexican beer portfolio. In the Wine and Spirits segment, we sell a portfolio that includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine brands complemented by certain higher-end spirits brands. Amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate growth and strategy, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations, and information technology, as well as our investments made through our corporate venture capital function. All costs included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are therefore not allocated to the other reportable segments. All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in our CODM\u2019s evaluation of the operating income (loss) performance of the other reportable segments. The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting. Long-lived tangible assets and total asset information by segment is not provided to, or reviewed by, our CODM as it is not used to make strategic decisions, allocate resources, or assess performance.\nIn addition, management excludes items that affect comparability (\u201cComparable Adjustments\u201d) from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these Comparable Adjustments are not reflective of core operations of the segments. Segment operating performance and segment\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 116\nmanagement compensation are evaluated based upon core segment operating income (loss). As such, the performance measures for incentive compensation purposes for segment management do not include the impact of these Comparable Adjustments.\nWe evaluate segment operating performance based on operating income (loss) of the respective business units. Comparable Adjustments that impacted comparability in our segment operating income (loss) for each period are as follows:\nFor the Years Ended\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\nFebruary 28,\n(in millions)\nCost of product sold\nStrategic business development costs\n$\n(124.5\n)\n$\n(6.0\n)\n$\n-\nNet gain (loss) on undesignated commodity derivative contracts\n(49.0\n)\n1.8\n7.4\nAccelerated depreciation\n(7.6\n)\n(8.9\n)\n-\nFlow through of inventory step-up\n(1.5\n)\n(4.9\n)\n(18.7\n)\nSettlements of undesignated commodity derivative contracts\n11.7\n(8.6\n)\n2.3\nRecovery of (loss on) on inventory write-down\n8.6\n(3.3\n)\n(19.1\n)\nTotal cost of product sold\n(162.3\n)\n(29.9\n)\n(28.1\n)\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nRestructuring and other strategic business development costs\n(25.3\n)\n(17.1\n)\n(14.0\n)\nImpairment of intangible assets\n(11.0\n)\n(108.0\n)\n(86.8\n)\nTransaction, integration, and other acquisition-related costs\n(9.2\n)\n(10.2\n)\n(11.3\n)\nNet gain (loss) on foreign currency derivative contracts associated with acquisition of investment\n-\n(32.6\n)\n-\nDeferred compensation\n-\n(16.3\n)\n-\nLoss on contract termination (1)\n-\n-\n(59.0\n)\nOther gains (losses) (2)\n5.5\n10.1\n10.5\nTotal selling, general, and administrative expenses\n(40.0\n)\n(174.1\n)\n(160.6\n)\nImpairment of assets held for sale\n(449.7\n)\n-\n-\nGain (loss) on sale of business\n74.1\n-\n-\nComparable Adjustments, Operating income (loss)\n$\n(577.9\n)\n$\n(204.0\n)\n$\n(188.7\n)\n(1)\nRepresents a loss incurred in connection with the early termination of a beer glass supply contract with an affiliate of Owens-Illinois.\n(2)\nIncludes the following:\nFor the Years Ended\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\nFebruary 28,\nIncrease in our ownership interest in Nelson\u2019s Green Brier\n11.8\n-\n-\nRecognition of previously deferred gain upon release of a related guarantee\n6.2\n-\n-\n(Increase) reduction in estimated fair value of a contingent liability associated with a prior period acquisition\n(11.4\n)\n-\n8.1\nSale of certain non-core assets\n(0.3\n)\n8.5\n-\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described for the Company in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT\nCOVID-19\nWe have an existing Crisis Management Committee that has been closely monitoring the impact of the novel strain of a virus, COVID-19, on our Company and our workforce since January 2020. In March 2020, the WHO recognized COVID-19 as a pandemic. COVID-19 has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world. In most of our locations, the beverage alcohol industry has been classified as an essential business and as such we are still able to produce and sell our products. COVID-19 has affected us primarily in the reduction of depletion volume on our products in the on-premise business due to shelter in place mandates and bar and restaurant closures. The on-premise business has historically been about 10% to 15% of our depletion volume for beer, wine, and spirits.\nCurrently, our major breweries, wineries, and bottling facilities are still operating but, in some instances, at lower production levels than planned. We have closed all hospitality, tasting rooms, retail, restaurants, and other non-essential public facilities. However, our supply chains and distribution channels have not been materially impacted and we have adequate supply of products to meet forecasted demand. The March 2020 closure of the U.S. and Mexico border to non-essential travel does not impact the movement of commercial products including the products we manufacture in Mexico and import to the U.S.\nWe have implemented various measures to reduce the spread of the virus including working from home, restricting visitors to our production locations, splitting our production workforces, reducing the on-site production workforce levels, screening workers before they enter facilities, implementing social distancing, and encouraging employees to adhere to prevention measures recommended by the CDC and the WHO.

This section identifies those accounting policies that are considered important to our results of operations and financial condition, require significant judgment and involve significant management estimates. Our significant accounting policies, including those considered to be critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an international beverage alcohol company with a broad portfolio of consumer-preferred high-end imported beer brands, and higher-end wine and spirits brands. Many of our products are recognized as leaders in their respective categories. We are one of the leading U.S. growth drivers at retail among beverage alcohol suppliers. In the U.S. market, we are the third-largest beer company and a leading higher-end wine company.\nThrough February 28, 2019, our internal management financial reporting consisted of two business divisions: (i) Beer and (ii) Wine and Spirits. Beginning March 1, 2019, as a result of our November 2018 Canopy Investment and a change in our CODM on March 1, 2019, we have changed our internal management financial reporting to consist of three business divisions: (i) Beer, (ii) Wine and Spirits, and (iii) Canopy. Consequently, beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we report our operating results in four segments: (i) Beer, (ii) Wine and Spirits, (iii) Corporate Operations and Other, and (iv) Canopy. Our Canopy Equity Method Investment makes up the Canopy segment.\nIn the Beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported and craft beer and alternative beverage alcohol brands. We have an exclusive perpetual brand license to import, market, and sell our\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 31\nMexican beer portfolio in the U.S. In the Wine and Spirits segment, our portfolio includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine brands complemented by certain higher-end spirits brands. Amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate growth and strategy, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations, and information technology, as well as our investments made through our corporate venture capital function. All costs included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are therefore not allocated to the other reportable segments. All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in our CODM\u2019s evaluation of the operating income (loss) performance of the other reportable segments. The new business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting.\nSTRATEGY\nOur overall strategy is to drive industry-leading growth, build unrivaled shareholder value, and shape the future of our industry by building brands that people love. We believe sharing a toast, unwinding after a day, celebrating milestones, and helping people connect, is Worth Reaching For. We position our portfolio to benefit from the consumer-led trend towards premiumization, which we believe will continue to result in faster growth rates in the higher-end of the beer, wine, and spirits categories. We focus on developing our expertise in consumer insights and category management, as well as our strong distributor network, which provides an effective route-to-market. Additionally, we leverage our scale across the total beverage alcohol market and our level of diversification hedges our portfolio risk. In addition to growing our existing business, we focus on targeted acquisitions of, and investments in, businesses that are higher-margin, higher-growth, consumer-led, have a low integration risk, and/or fill a gap in our portfolio. We also strive to identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics (see \u201cInvestments, Acquisitions, and Divestitures - Canopy Investments\u201d below).\nWe strive to strengthen our portfolio of higher-end beer, wine, and spirits brands and differentiate ourselves through:\n\u2022\nleveraging our leading position in total beverage alcohol and our scale with wholesalers and retailers to expand distribution of our product portfolio;\n\u2022\nstrengthening relationships with wholesalers and retailers by providing consumer and beverage alcohol insights;\n\u2022\ninvesting in brand building and innovation activities;\n\u2022\npositioning ourselves for success with consumer-led products that identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics;\n\u2022\nrealizing operating efficiencies through expanding and enhancing production capabilities and maximizing asset utilization; and\n\u2022\ndeveloping employees to enhance performance in the marketplace.\nOur business strategy for the Beer segment focuses on leading the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market and includes continued focus on growing our beer portfolio in the U.S. through expanding distribution for key brands, as well as new product development and innovation within the existing portfolio of brands, and continued expansion, construction, and optimization activities for our Mexico beer operations. Additionally, in an effort to more fully compete in growing sectors of the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, we have leveraged our innovation capabilities to introduce new brands that align with consumer trends. We continue to refine our options to optimize the value of our Beer segment and drive increased focus on our high-performing import portfolio and upcoming new product introductions. See \u201cRecent Developments - Ballast Point Transaction\u201d below.\nIn connection with our business strategy for the Beer segment, we have more than tripled the production capacity of our brewery located in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico since its June 2013 acquisition.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 32\nAdditionally, we are continuing to invest to expand our brewery operations in Obregon, Sonora, Mexico, where expansion is expected to be completed by the end of Fiscal 2021, although containment actions associated with COVID-19 may alter that timeline. See \u201cCapital Expenditures\u201d below for discussion of a recent public consultation on construction of a new brewery in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico. Expansion, construction, and optimization efforts continue under our previously-announced Mexico Beer Expansion Projects (as defined below in \u201cCapital Expenditures\u201d) to align with our anticipated future growth expectations (see \u201cCapital Expenditures\u201d below).\nOur business strategy for the Wine and Spirits segment is to build an industry-leading portfolio of higher-end wine and spirits brands. We are investing to meet the evolving needs of consumers; building brands through consumer insights, sensory expertise, and innovation; and refreshing existing brands, as we continue to focus on moving our branded wine and spirits portfolio towards a higher-margin, higher-growth portfolio of brands. We dedicate a large share of our sales and marketing resources to well-known wine and spirits brands sold in the U.S., which comprise the U.S. Power Brands as they represent a majority of our U.S. wine and spirits revenue and profitability, and generally hold strong positions in their respective price categories. We focus our innovation and investment dollars on those brands within our portfolio which position us to benefit from the consumer-led trend towards premiumization. Additionally, in connection with the New Wine and Spirits Transactions, Other Wine and Spirits Transactions, and the Black Velvet Divestiture, we expect to optimize the value of our wine and spirits portfolio by driving increased focus on our higher-end Power Brands to accelerate growth and improve overall operating margins. In markets where it is feasible, we entered into contractual arrangements to consolidate our U.S. distribution network in order to obtain dedicated distributor selling resources which focus on our U.S. wine and spirits portfolio to drive organic growth. This consolidated U.S. distribution network currently represents about 70% of our branded wine and spirits volume in the U.S. Throughout the terms of these contracts, we generally expect shipments on an annual basis to these distributors to essentially equal the distributors\u2019 shipments to retailers.\nMarketing, sales, and distribution of our products are managed on a geographic basis in order to fully leverage leading market positions. In addition, market dynamics and consumer trends vary across each of our markets. Within our primary market in the U.S., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, craft beer, branded wine, and spirits categories, with generally separate distribution networks utilized for (i) our beer portfolio and (ii) our wine and spirits portfolio. The environment for our products is competitive in each of our markets.\nWe complemented our total beverage alcohol strategy in an adjacent category by making investments in Canopy, a world-leading, diversified cannabis company. These investments are consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics, and they represent a significant expansion of our strategic relationship to position Canopy as a global leader in cannabis production, branding, intellectual property, and retailing.\nWe remain committed to our long-term financial model of: growing sales, expanding margins, and increasing cash flow in order to achieve earnings per share growth, maintain our targeted leverage ratio, and deliver returns to shareholders through the payment of quarterly cash dividends and periodic share repurchases.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19\nWe have an existing Crisis Management Committee that has been closely monitoring the impact of the novel strain of a virus, COVID-19, on our Company and our workforce since January 2020. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) recognized COVID-19 as a pandemic. COVID-19 has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world. In response to COVID-19, the governments of many countries, states, cities, and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations and advising or requiring individuals to\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 33\nlimit or forgo their time outside of their homes. Temporary closures of businesses have been ordered and numerous other businesses have temporarily closed voluntarily. Further, individuals' ability to travel has been curtailed through mandated travel restrictions and may be further limited through additional voluntary or mandated closures of travel-related businesses. In most of our locations, the beverage alcohol industry has been classified as an essential business and as such we are still able to produce and sell our products. COVID-19 has affected us primarily in the reduction of depletion volume on our products in the on-premise business due to shelter in place mandates and bar and restaurant closures. The on-premise business has historically been about 10% to 15% of our depletion volume for beer, wine, and spirits.\nCurrently, our major breweries, wineries, and bottling facilities are still operating but, in some instances, at lower production levels than planned. We have closed all hospitality, tasting rooms, retail, restaurants, and other non-essential public facilities. However, our supply chains and distribution channels have not been materially impacted and we have adequate supply of products to meet forecasted demand. The March 2020 closure of the U.S. and Mexico border to non-essential travel does not impact the movement of commercial products including the products we manufacture in Mexico and import to the U.S.\nWe have implemented various measures to reduce the spread of the virus including working from home, restricting visitors to our production locations, splitting our production workforces, reducing the on-site production workforce levels, screening workers before they enter facilities, implementing social distancing, and encouraging employees to adhere to prevention measures recommended by the Center for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d) and the WHO. Since our non-production workforce is able to work remotely using various technology tools, we are able to maintain our operations and internal controls over financial reporting and disclosures.\nAt this time, we are not able to estimate the long-term impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flow. We believe we have sufficient liquidity available from operating cash flow, cash on hand, and availability under our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. We expect to have continued access to capital markets and to continue to return value to shareholders.\nNew Wine and Spirits Transactions\nIn April 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement with E. & J. Gallo Winery (\u201cGallo\u201d) to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business, including approximately 30 lower-margin, lower-growth wine and spirits brands, wineries, vineyards, offices, and facilities.\nIn December 2019, we agreed to revise and supersede the Wine and Spirits Transaction. The revisions to the transaction address competitive concerns raised by the FTC specifically related to the sparkling wine, brandy, dessert wine, and concentrate categories. As a result, the brands Cook\u2019s California Champagne, J. Roget American Champagne, Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy, and our concentrate business will be excluded from the transaction with Gallo resulting in an adjusted transaction price of approximately $843 million, with the potential to earn an incremental $250 million of contingent consideration if certain brand performance provisions are met over a two-year period after closing. The Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction is expected to close around the end of first quarter of fiscal 2021, and is subject to required regulatory clearances and governmental review and approval. Additionally, in a separate, but related, transaction we agreed that upon execution and delivery of a definitive agreement for the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction, we would enter into an agreement to sell the New Zealand-based Nobilo Wine brand and certain related assets for $130 million to Gallo. The Nobilo Wine Transaction is expected to close by the end of second quarter of fiscal 2021 and is subject to FTC and New Zealand regulatory review and approval. Completion of the Nobilo Transaction is also conditioned on completion of the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction. We expect to use the net cash proceeds from the New Wine and Spirits Transactions primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings. The New Wine and Spirits Transactions are consistent with our strategic focus on higher-margin, higher-growth brands.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 34\nWe have communicated our intent to retain the brands Cook\u2019s California Champagne and J. Roget American Champagne contemplated under the Wine and Spirits Transaction and the FTC is currently reviewing our business plans to support these brands in the future.\nOther Wine and Spirits Transactions\nWe are pursuing other opportunities to divest the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy brand and concentrate business excluded from the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction to companies with more aligned business strategies.\nIn connection with the New Wine and Spirits Transactions and the Other Wine and Spirits Transactions, we have wine and spirits net assets of $1,072.4 million that have met the held for sale criteria as of February 29, 2020.\nSelected financial information included in our results of operations for the portion of the business that we expect will no longer be part of our consolidated results after the closing of the New Wine and Spirits Transactions and Other Wine and Spirits Transactions is as follows:\nNet Sales\nGross Profit\nMarketing (1)\n(in millions)\nFiscal 2020\nWine and Spirits segment results\n$\n$\n$\n(1)\nThis expense is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated results of operations.\nFor additional information regarding the New Wine and Spirits Transactions and the Other Wine and Spirits Transactions, refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nBallast Point Transaction\nIn March 2020, we sold the Ballast Point craft beer business, including a number of its associated production facilities and brewpubs. This divestiture is consistent with our strategic focus on our high-performing import portfolio and upcoming new product introductions. For additional information regarding the Ballast Point Transaction, refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nPrimarily in connection with the Ballast Point Transaction, we have beer net assets of $45.3 million that met the held for sale criteria as of February 29, 2020.\nCanopy production optimization\nIn March 2020, Canopy announced its plans to close two Canadian greenhouse facilities as part of its efforts to align supply and demand while improving production efficiencies over time. In April 2020, Canopy announced its plans to close an additional Canadian greenhouse facility, exit its operations in Africa, and reduce Latin America and United States cultivation activities. Canopy expects to record an estimated pre-tax loss of approximately C$700 million to C$800 million in their fourth quarter fiscal 2020 results from the facilities closures as well as other changes related to its organizational and strategic review. We will record our proportional share of Canopy\u2019s estimated pre-tax loss of approximately C$245 million to C$280 million, in our first quarter fiscal 2021 results.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 35\nInvestments, Acquisitions, and Divestitures\nCanopy Segment\nCanopy Investments\nOur investments in Canopy, and the method of accounting for these investments, consist of the following:\nDate of\nInvestment\nInvestment\nAcquired\nPurchase\nPrice\nMethod of\nAccounting\n(in millions)\nNov 2017\nCommon shares\n$\n130.1\nFair value / equity method (1)\nNov 2017\nWarrants\n61.2\nFair value\n$\n191.3\nJune 2018\nConvertible debt securities\n$\n150.5\nFair value\nNov 2018\nCommon shares\n$\n2,740.3\nEquity method\nNov 2018\nWarrants (3)\n1,146.8\nFair value\n$\n3,887.1\n(2)\nWe recognized an unrealized net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of these investments accounted for at fair value in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments, as follows:\nDate of\nInvestment\nInvestment\nFiscal 2020\nFiscal 2019\n(in millions)\nNov 2017\nCommon shares (1)\n$\n-\n$\n292.5\nNov 2017\nWarrants\n(543.7\n)\n465.5\nJune 2018\nConvertible debt securities\n(94.6\n)\n55.5\nNov 2018\nWarrants (3)\n(1,488.1\n)\n1,157.7\n$\n(2,126.4\n)\n$\n1,971.2\n(1)\nAccounted for at fair value from the date of investment in November 2017 through October 31, 2018.

Excludes $7.3 million of direct acquisition costs associated with the investment in warrants which are expensed as incurred in selling, general, and administrative expenses.\n(3)\nIn June 2019, the Canopy Shareholders approved the modification of the terms of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants. For additional information refer to Note 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. Fiscal 2020 includes a $1,176.0 million unrealized gain resulting from the June 2019 Warrant Modification.\nWe expect the value of the Canopy investments accounted for at fair value to be volatile in future periods. We evaluated the Canopy investments as of February 29, 2020, and determined that there was not an other-than-temporary-impairment. Additionally, since November 1, 2018, we recognize equity in earnings (losses) and related activities for our Canopy Equity Method Investment on a two-month lag. Accordingly, we recognized our share of Canopy\u2019s earnings (losses) from January through December 2019, in our Fiscal 2020 results. We recognized our share of Canopy\u2019s losses from November and December 2018, in our Fiscal 2019 results. We expect Canopy\u2019s earnings to be volatile in future periods.\nAs of February 29, 2020, the conversion of Canopy equity securities held by its employees and/or held by other third parties, excluding our November 2017 Canopy Warrants, New November 2018 Canopy Warrants, Canopy Debt Securities, and the Acreage Call Option, would not have a significant effect on our share of Canopy\u2019s reported earnings or losses. Additionally, under an amended and restated investor\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 36\nrights agreement, we have the option to purchase additional common shares of Canopy at the then-current price of the underlying equity security to allow us to maintain our relative ownership interest. If we exercised all of our outstanding November 2017 Canopy Warrants and New November 2018 Canopy Warrants, it could have a significant effect on our share of Canopy\u2019s reported earnings or losses and our ownership interest in Canopy would be expected to increase to greater than 50 percent. In connection with the Acreage Transaction, Canopy has the Acreage Call Option, which would require the issuance of Canopy shares. If Canopy exercised the Acreage Call Option it could have a significant effect on our share of Canopy\u2019s reported earnings or losses and our ownership interest in Canopy would decrease and no longer be expected to be greater than 50 percent.\nAs previously noted, these investments are consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics, and they represent a significant expansion of our strategic relationship to position Canopy as a global leader in cannabis production, branding, intellectual property, and retailing.\nBeer Segment\nFour Corners acquisition\nIn July 2018, we acquired Four Corners, which primarily included the acquisition of operations, goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, and trademarks. This acquisition included a portfolio of high-quality, dynamic, and bicultural, Texas-based craft beers which further strengthened our position in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market. The results of operations of Four Corners are reported in the Beer segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.\nWine and Spirits Segment\nBlack Velvet Divestiture\nOn November 1, 2019, we sold the Black Velvet Canadian Whisky business and the brand\u2019s associated production facility, along with a subset of Canadian whisky brands produced at that facility, and related inventory at a transaction value of $266.3 million. Accordingly, our consolidated results of operations include the results of operations of our Canadian whisky business through the date of divestiture. We received cash proceeds of $269.7 million, subject to estimated working capital adjustments. This divestiture is consistent with our strategic focus on higher-margin, higher-growth brands. We recognized a net gain of $74.1 million on the sale of the business for the year ended February 29, 2020.\nNelson\u2019s Green Brier acquisition\nIn May 2019, we increased our ownership interest in Nelson\u2019s Green Brier to 75%, resulting in consolidation of the business and recognition of a 25% noncontrolling interest. This acquisition included a portfolio of award-winning, Tennessee-based craft bourbon and whiskey products. The preliminary fair value of the business combination was allocated primarily to goodwill, trademarks, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment. The results of operations of Nelson\u2019s Green Brier are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.\nSale of Accolade Wine Investment\nIn May 2018, we completed the sale of our remaining interest in our previously-owned Australian and European business for A$149.1 million, or $113.6 million. We received cash proceeds, net of direct costs to sell, of $111.7 million. This interest consisted of an investment accounted for under the cost method and AFS debt securities. We recognized net gains of $0.4 million and $99.8 million in connection with this transaction for the years ended February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, respectively. These net gains are included in income from unconsolidated investments.\nFor additional information on these recent developments, investments, acquisitions, and divestitures refer to Notes 2, 7, and 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 37\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nReferences to organic throughout the following discussion exclude the impact of divested brand activity in connection with the Black Velvet Divestiture (wine and spirits), as appropriate.\nFinancial Highlights for Fiscal 2020:\n\u2022\nOur results of operations were negatively impacted by (i) an unrealized net loss from the changes in fair value of our investments in Canopy, (ii) equity in losses from Canopy\u2019s results of operations and related activities, and (iii) an impairment of long-lived assets held for sale primarily in connection with the New Wine and Spirits Transactions, partially offset by (i) an unrealized gain resulting from the June 2019 modification of the terms of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants and (ii) the continued improvements within the Beer segment.\n\u2022\nNet sales increased 3% primarily due to an increase in Beer net sales driven predominantly by volume growth and a favorable impact from pricing within our Mexican beer portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in Wine and Spirits net sales led by branded volume decline largely from brands to be divested.\n\u2022\nOperating income (loss) decreased 11% largely due to an impairment of long-lived assets held for sale primarily in connection with the New Wine and Spirits Transactions and restructuring and other strategic business development costs incurred in connection with ongoing efforts to gain efficiencies and reduce our cost structure primarily within the Wine and Spirits segment, partially offset by the net sales volume growth and favorable impact from pricing within our Mexican beer portfolio and a net gain related to the Black Velvet Divestiture.\n\u2022\nNet income (loss) attributable to CBI and diluted net income (loss) per common share attributable to CBI decreased significantly primarily due to an unrealized net loss on our investments in Canopy for Fiscal 2020, as compared with an unrealized net gain from the changes in fair value on our investments for Fiscal 2019, partially offset by a net income tax benefit recognized as a result of tax reform enacted in Switzerland.\nCOMPARABLE ADJUSTMENTS\nManagement excludes items that affect comparability from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these Comparable Adjustments are not reflective of core operations of the segments. Segment operating performance and segment management compensation are evaluated based on core segment operating income (loss). As such, the performance measures for incentive compensation purposes for segment management do not include the impact of these Comparable Adjustments.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 38\nAs more fully described herein and in the related Notes to the Financial Statements, the Comparable Adjustments that impacted comparability in our segment results for each period are as follows:\nFiscal 2020\nFiscal 2019\n(in millions)\nCost of product sold\nStrategic business development costs\n$\n(124.5\n)\n$\n(6.0\n)\nNet gain (loss) on undesignated commodity derivative contracts\n(49.0\n)\n1.8\nAccelerated depreciation\n(7.6\n)\n(8.9\n)\nFlow through of inventory step-up\n(1.5\n)\n(4.9\n)\nSettlements of undesignated commodity derivative contracts\n11.7\n(8.6\n)\nRecovery of (loss on) inventory write-down\n8.6\n(3.3\n)\nTotal cost of product sold\n(162.3\n)\n(29.9\n)\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nRestructuring and other strategic business development costs\n(25.3\n)\n(17.1\n)\nImpairment of intangible assets\n(11.0\n)\n(108.0\n)\nTransaction, integration, and other acquisition-related costs\n(9.2\n)\n(10.2\n)\nNet gain (loss) on foreign currency derivative contracts associated with acquisition of investment\n-\n(32.6\n)\nDeferred compensation\n-\n(16.3\n)\nOther gains (losses)\n5.5\n10.1\nTotal selling, general, and administrative expenses\n(40.0\n)\n(174.1\n)\nImpairment of assets held for sale\n(449.7\n)\n-\nGain (loss) on sale of business\n74.1\n-\nComparable Adjustments, Operating income (loss)\n$\n(577.9\n)\n$\n(204.0\n)\nIncome (loss) from unconsolidated investments\n$\n(2,480.1\n)\n$\n2,084.9\nCost of Product Sold\nStrategic Business Development Costs\nWe recognized costs primarily in connection with losses on write-downs of excess inventory, bulk wine sales, and contract terminations resulting from our ongoing efforts to optimize our portfolio, gain efficiencies, and reduce our cost structure within the Wine and Spirits segment.\nUndesignated Commodity Derivative Contracts\nNet gain (loss) on undesignated commodity derivative contracts represents a net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of undesignated commodity derivative contracts. The net gain (loss) is reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is recognized in the segment operating results. At settlement, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the undesignated commodity derivative contracts is reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing the results of our operating segments to reflect the economic effects of the commodity derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.\nAccelerated Depreciation\nWe recognized accelerated depreciation for certain assets primarily in connection with our current multi-year implementation of a new ERP system which is intended to replace our existing operating and financial systems.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 39\nInventory Step-Up\nIn connection with acquisitions, the allocation of purchase price in excess of book value for certain inventories on hand at the date of acquisition is referred to as inventory step-up. Inventory step-up represents an assumed manufacturing profit attributable to the acquired business prior to acquisition.\nRecovery of (Loss on) Inventory Write-Down\nWe recognized a reimbursement from our insurance carriers for losses recognized on the write-down of certain bulk wine inventory as a result of smoke damage sustained during the Fall 2017 California wildfires (Fiscal 2020). We recognized a loss on the write-down of certain bulk wine inventory as a result of smoke damage sustained during the Fall 2017 California wildfires (Fiscal 2019). For additional information, refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nRestructuring and Other Strategic Business Development Costs\nWe recognized costs primarily in connection with (i) costs from our ongoing efforts to gain efficiencies and reduce our cost structure in connection with a program intended to optimize the Wine and Spirits segment (Fiscal 2020) and (ii) costs recognized in connection with the development of a program specifically intended to identify opportunities for further streamlining of processes and improving capabilities, linking strategy with execution, prioritizing resources, and enabling a new ERP system.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nWe recognized trademark impairment losses related to our Beer segment\u2019s Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset. For additional information, refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nTransaction, Integration, and Other Acquisition-Related Costs\nWe recognized transaction, integration, and other acquisition-related costs in connection with our acquisitions, divestitures, and investments.\nNet Gain (Loss) on Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts Associated with Acquisition of Investment\nWe recognized a net loss in connection with the settlement of foreign currency option contracts entered into to fix the U.S. dollar cost of the November 2018 Canopy Transaction.\nDeferred Compensation\nWe recognized an adjustment related to prior periods to correct for previously unrecognized deferred compensation costs associated with certain employment agreements.\nOther Gains (Losses)\nWe recognized other gains (losses) primarily in connection with (i) a gain on the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in Nelson\u2019s Green Brier to the acquisition-date fair value (Fiscal 2020), (ii) an increase in estimated fair value of a contingent liability associated with a prior period acquisition (Fiscal 2020), (iii) recognition of previously deferred gain upon release of a related guarantee (Fiscal 2020), and (iv) a gain primarily in connection with the sale of certain non-core assets (Fiscal 2019).\nImpairment of Assets Held for Sale\nWe recognized an impairment of long-lived assets held for sale in connection with the New Wine and Spirits Transactions, Other Wine and Spirits Transactions, and the Ballast Point Transaction.\nGain (Loss) on Sale of Business\nWe recognized a net gain on sale of the Black Velvet Canadian Whisky business.\nIncome (Loss) from Unconsolidated Investments\nWe recognized an unrealized gain (loss) primarily from (i) the changes in fair value of our securities measured at fair value, (ii) the increase in fair value resulting from the June 2019 modification\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 41\nThe decrease in Wine and Spirits net sales is primarily due to (i) $193.0 million decline in branded wine and spirits volume and (ii) $26.0 million decrease in net sales from the Black Velvet Divestiture, partially offset by (i) $20.0 million of favorable product mix shift and (ii) $7.7 million favorable impact from pricing. The Wine and Spirits Fiscal 2020 results have been negatively impacted by transition activities with distributors who are repositioning for ownership of brands upon closing the New Wine and Spirits Transactions and the Black Velvet Divestiture.\nCanopy Segment\nOur ownership interest in Canopy allows us to exercise significant influence, but not control, and, therefore, we account for our investment in Canopy under the equity method. Amounts included for the Canopy segment represent 100% of Canopy\u2019s reported results on a two-month lag, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and converted from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars. Although we own less than 100% of the outstanding shares of Canopy, 100% of the Canopy results are included and subsequently eliminated in order to reconcile to our consolidated financial statements. Canopy segment amounts reflect twelve months of activity for Fiscal 2020 as compared with two months of activity for Fiscal 2019, due to the timing of the November 2018 Canopy Investment. See \u201cIncome (Loss) from Unconsolidated Investments\u201d below for a discussion of Canopy\u2019s net sales, gross profit (loss), selling, general, and administrative expenses, and operating income (loss).\nGross Profit\nFiscal 2020\nFiscal 2019\nDollar\nChange\nPercent\nChange\n(in millions)\nBeer\n$\n3,125.2\n$\n2,830.7\n$\n294.5\n%\nWine and Spirits\n1,189.0\n1,279.5\n(90.5\n)\n(7\n%)\nCanopy\n45.4\n11.2\n34.2\nNM\nConsolidation and Eliminations\n(45.4\n)\n(11.2\n)\n(34.2\n)\nNM\nComparable Adjustments\n(162.3\n)\n(29.9\n)\n(132.4\n)\nNM\nConsolidated gross profit\n$\n4,151.9\n$\n4,080.3\n$\n71.6\n%\nThe increase in Beer is primarily due to $183.4 million of volume growth, $118.4 million of favorable impact from pricing, and $17.5 million of lower cost of product sold for our Mexican beer business, partially offset by a decline of $14.0 million in our craft beer portfolio. The lower cost of product sold is largely due to foreign currency transactional benefits of $24.2 million and decreased operational costs of $3.9 million, partially offset by increased warehousing and transportation costs of $10.6 million.\nThe decrease in Wine and Spirits is largely due to (i) $83.1 million of decline in branded wine and spirits volume, (ii) $27.2 million higher cost of product sold, and (iii) $12.3 million decrease in gross profit from the Black Velvet Divestiture, partially offset by $27.3 million of favorable product mix shift. The higher cost of product sold is largely attributable to higher grape raw material and processing costs as well as increased transportation costs.\nGross profit as a percent of net sales decreased to 49.8% for Fiscal 2020 compared with 50.3% for Fiscal 2019. This was largely due to an unfavorable change of 155 basis points in Comparable Adjustments and higher cost of product sold within the Wine and Spirits segment, which resulted in approximately 30 basis points of rate decline, partially offset by rate growth from (i) the favorable impact from Beer pricing in select markets, which contributed approximately 70 basis points, (ii) favorable impact from Wine and Spirits product mix shift, which resulted in 20 basis points, (iii) lower cost of product sold within the Beer segment, which resulted in 20 basis points of rate growth, and (iv) favorable volume growth from Beer which resulted in approximately 20 basis points.\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

The increase in marketing spend is due to planned investment to support the growth of our Mexican beer portfolio, including support of the new product introductions. The increase in general and administrative expenses is largely driven by increased headcount supporting the growth of the business, partially offset by favorable foreign currency transaction gains.\nThe decrease in Wine and Spirits is largely due to a decrease of $19.4 million in general and administrative expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is driven by certain cost saving initiatives including decreased compensation and benefits.\nThe increase in Corporate Operations and Other is due to an increase of approximately $17 million in insurance related costs, $13 million in compensation and benefits, and higher information technology costs supporting the implementation of our new ERP system, partially offset by a reduction in consulting costs.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 19.4% for Fiscal 2020 as compared with 20.6% for Fiscal 2019. The decrease is driven largely by (i) a favorable change of 170 basis points in Comparable Adjustments.

This decrease is driven largely by an unrealized net loss of $2,126.4 million for Fiscal 2020, which consists of an unrealized net loss from the changes in fair value of our securities measured at fair value of $3,302.4 million, partially offset by an unrealized gain of $1,176.0 million from the June 2019 modification of the terms of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants, as compared with an unrealized net gain of $1,971.2 million recognized for Fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2020 was also negatively impacted by $575.9 million of equity in losses from Canopy\u2019s results of operations, and related activities, while Fiscal 2019 benefited from a net gain in connection with the sale of our Accolade Wine Investment of $99.8 million.\nCanopy Segment\nCanopy\u2019s Fiscal 2020 net sales; gross profit (loss); selling, general, and administrative expenses; and operating income (loss) are not comparable against Fiscal 2019 due the timing of the November 2018 Canopy Investment and recognizing equity in earnings (losses) and related activities on a two-month lag. We have recognized twelve months of activity for Fiscal 2020 as compared with two months of activity for Fiscal 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased to $428.7 million for Fiscal 2020 from $367.1 million for Fiscal 2019, an increase of $61.6 million, or 17%. This increase is predominantly due to higher average borrowings of approximately $1.7 billion primarily attributable to the November 2018 Canopy Transaction.\n(Provision For) Benefit From Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for Fiscal 2020 was 102.3% of tax benefit as compared with 16.5% of tax expense for Fiscal 2019. The change in effective tax rate was driven primarily by the recognition of a $547.4 million net income tax benefit resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets for Fiscal 2020 in connection with the September 2019 enactment of tax reform in Switzerland. The Fiscal 2020 rate also benefited from (i) a higher effective rate of tax benefit from our foreign businesses including the tax benefits recorded on the net unrealized loss from the changes in fair value of our investments in Canopy and the tax benefits recorded on the Canopy equity in losses and related activities and (ii) recognition of net income tax benefits from stock-based compensation award activity.\nFor additional information, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nWe expect our reported effective tax rate for the next fiscal year to be in the range of 17% to 19%. This includes an estimated impact for (i) benefits related to the recognition of the income tax effect of stock-based compensation awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled and (ii) lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses. This range does not reflect (i) any potential impacts from COVID-19, (ii) any future changes in the fair value of our Canopy investments measured at fair value and any future equity in earnings (losses) and related activities from the Canopy Equity Method Investment, and (iii) any additional gain (loss) recognized in connection with the New Wine and Spirits Transactions, Other Wine and Spirits Transactions, and the Ballast Point Transaction since these estimates are not currently available.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 44\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to CBI\nNet income (loss) attributable to CBI decreased to $(11.8) million for Fiscal 2020 from $3,435.9 million for Fiscal 2019. This decrease of $3,447.7 million is largely attributable to the significant decrease in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments discussed above, an impairment of long-lived assets held for sale as well as the decline in operating performance from Wine and Spirits. These decreases were partially offset by solid operating performance from Beer contributing an additional $205.0 million of operating income.\nFINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nGeneral\nOur ability to consistently generate cash flow from operating activities is one of our most significant financial strengths. Our strong cash flows enable us to invest in our people and our brands, make appropriate capital investments, provide a quarterly cash dividend program, and from time-to-time, repurchase shares of our common stock and make strategic investments and acquisitions that we believe will enhance shareholder value. Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operating activities. Our principal use of cash in our operating activities is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable. Historically, we have used cash flow from operating activities to repay our short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures. Additionally, we have a commercial paper program which we use to fund our short-term borrowing requirements and to maintain our access to the capital markets. We will continue to use our short-term borrowings, including our commercial paper program, to support our working capital requirements and capital expenditures. COVID-19 has negatively impacted the global economy and financial markets which could interfere with our ability to access sources of liquidity at favorable rates and generate operating cash flows. We are currently evaluating recent COVID-19 related legislation and governmental initiatives and expect to take advantage of opportunities to temporarily defer some payments including certain excise and payroll taxes.\nWe have maintained adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. Absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, primarily short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share repurchases, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs.\nWe have plans to sell a portion of our U.S. wine and spirits business. We expect to use the net cash proceeds from closing these transactions primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings.\nThe November 2017 Canopy Warrants with an exercise price of C$12.98 per warrant share will expire on May 1, 2020. We will evaluate exercise of the warrants immediately prior to expiration. If a decision is made to exercise the November 2017 Canopy Warrants, we expect to fund the C$245 million transaction with cash from operations.\nCash Flows\nFiscal 2020\nFiscal 2019\nDollar Change\n(in millions)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n2,551.1\n$\n2,246.3\n$\n304.8\nInvesting activities\n(531.0\n)\n(4,831.8\n)\n4,300.8\nFinancing activities\n(2,031.4\n)\n2,593.3\n(4,624.7\n)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n(0.9\n)\n(4.5\n)\n3.6\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n(12.2\n)\n$\n3.3\n$\n(15.5\n)\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 45\nOperating Activities\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities for Fiscal 2020 is largely due to strong cash flow from the Beer segment driven primarily by the segment\u2019s solid operating results, combined with the timing of collections for recoverable value-added taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities also benefited from lower income tax payments largely due to a change in estimated taxable income and the receipt of a higher federal tax refund for Fiscal 2020 as compared with Fiscal 2019. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by higher cash outflows from accounts payable primarily attributable to the timing of payments for the Wine and Spirits segment.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2020 decreased primarily due to the $3,869.9 million November 2018 Canopy Transaction, proceeds of $269.7 million from the November 2019 Black Velvet Divestiture, and lower Fiscal 2020 capital expenditures of $159.8 million. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by proceeds received in Fiscal 2019 of $110.2 million from the May 2018 sale of our Accolade Wine Investment.\nBusiness acquisitions, divestitures, and investments consist primarily of the following:\nAcquisitions\nDivestitures\nInvestments\nFiscal 2020\n\u25cf Nelson\u2019s Green Brier\n\u25cf Black Velvet Canadian Whisky\nFiscal 2019\n\u25cf Four Corners\n\u25cf Accolade Wine Investment\n\u25cf November 2018 Canopy Investment\nFinancing Activities\nThe increase in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities consists of:\nFiscal 2020\nFiscal 2019\nDollar\nChange\n(in millions)\nNet proceeds from (payments of) debt, current and long-term, and related activities\n$\n(1,464.8\n)\n$\n3,605.7\n$\n(5,070.5\n)\nDividends paid\n(569.2\n)\n(557.7\n)\n(11.5\n)\nPurchases of treasury stock\n(50.0\n)\n(504.3\n)\n454.3\nNet cash provided by stock-based compensation activities\n63.9\n49.6\n14.3\nPayment of contingent consideration\n(11.3\n)\n-\n(11.3\n)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n$\n(2,031.4\n)\n$\n2,593.3\n$\n(4,624.7\n)\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 46\nDebt\nTotal debt outstanding as of February 29, 2020, amounted to $12,184.6 million, a decrease of $1,431.9 million from February 28, 2019. The decrease consisted of:\nBank Facilities\nIn June 2019, we entered into the 2019 Term Credit Agreement which resulted in the creation of a $491.3 million five-year term loan facility. We utilized the proceeds from the borrowings under the 2019 Term Credit Agreement to repay in full the U.S. Term A-1 Facility under the 2018 Credit Agreement.\nIn March 2020, we entered into the 2020 Restatement Agreement that amended and restated the 2018 Credit Agreement. The 2020 Restatement Agreement resulted in (i) the removal of the subsidiary guarantees and termination of the guarantee agreement, (ii) the inclusion of the parent guaranty provisions in connection with the termination of the guarantee agreement, (iii) the removal of certain provisions pertaining to term loans since no term loans are outstanding, and (iv) the revision of the LIBOR successor rate provisions to permit the use of rates based on the SOFR administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nIn March 2020, we entered into the Term Loan Restatement Agreement and the 2020 Term Loan Restatement Agreement, that amended and restated the Term Credit Agreement and the 2019 Term Credit Agreement, respectively. The Term Loan Restatement Agreement and the 2020 Term Loan Restatement Agreement each resulted in (i) the removal of the subsidiary guarantees and termination of the respective guarantee agreements and (ii) the revision of the LIBOR successor rate provisions in each to permit the use of rates based on SOFR.\nSenior Notes\nIn July 2019, we issued the July 2019 Senior Notes. Proceeds from this offering, net of discount and debt issuance costs, of $793.0 million were used for the repayment of our 3.875% November 2014 Senior Notes and a portion of the outstanding obligations under the Five-Year Term Facility under our Term Credit Agreement.\nGeneral\nThe majority of our outstanding borrowings as of February 29, 2020, consisted of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, with maturities ranging from calendar 2020 to calendar 2048, and variable-rate senior unsecured term loan facilities under our Term Credit Agreement and 2019 Term Credit Agreement, with maturities ranging from calendar 2021 to calendar 2024.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 47\nAdditionally, we have a commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion of commercial paper. Our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the amount available under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 Credit Agreement.\nWe do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper and, therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. If the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding commercial paper borrowings mature, we will utilize unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 Credit Agreement to repay commercial paper borrowings. We do not expect that fluctuations in demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 Credit Agreement.\nWe had the following borrowing capacity available under our 2018 Credit Agreement:\nRemaining Borrowing Capacity\nFebruary 29,\nApril 15,\n(in millions)\nRevolving Credit Facility (1)\n$\n1,749.2\n$\n1,988.2\n(1)\nNet of outstanding revolving credit facility borrowings and outstanding letters of credit under our 2018 Credit Agreement and outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program.\nThe financial institutions participating in our 2018 Credit Agreement have complied with prior funding requests and we believe such financial institutions will comply with any future funding requests. However, there can be no assurances that any particular financial institution will continue to do so.\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to covenants that are contained in the 2018 Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness) by subsidiaries, additional liens, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions, and thresholds. The financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 48\nleverage ratio, both as defined in the 2018 Credit Agreement. As of February 29, 2020, under the 2018 Credit Agreement, the minimum interest coverage ratio was 2.5x and the maximum net leverage ratio was 5.0x.\nThe representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default set forth in our Term Credit Agreement and our 2019 Term Credit Agreement are substantially similar to those set forth in our 2018 Credit Agreement.\nOur indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes contain certain covenants, including, but not limited to: (i) a limitation on liens on certain assets, (ii) a limitation on certain sale and leaseback transactions, and (iii) restrictions on mergers, consolidations, and the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to another person. Upon the March 2020 removal of all of the subsidiary guarantors from our 2018 Credit Agreement, the subsidiary guarantors were automatically released from the indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes.\nAs of February 29, 2020, we were in compliance with our covenants under the 2018 Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement, 2019 Term Credit Agreement, and our indentures, and have met all debt payment obligations.\nFor a complete discussion and presentation of all borrowings and available sources of borrowing, refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nCommon Stock Dividends\nOn April 2, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per share of Class A Common Stock, $0.68 per share of Class B Convertible Common Stock, and $0.68 per share of Class 1 Common Stock payable on May 19, 2020, to stockholders of record of each class on May 5, 2020. We expect to return approximately $565 million to stockholders in Fiscal 2021 through cash dividends.\nWe currently expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of our common stock in the future, but such payments are subject to approval of our Board of Directors and are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors, including those set forth under Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur Board of Directors have authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock under the 2018 Authorization. Shares repurchased under this authorization have become treasury shares.\nAs of February 29, 2020, total shares repurchased under this authorization are as follows:\nClass A Common Shares\nRepurchase Authorization\nDollar Value of Shares Repurchased\nNumber of Shares Repurchased\n(in millions, except share data)\n2018 Authorization\n$\n3,000.0\n$\n1,045.9\n4,897,605\nShare repurchases under the 2018 Authorization may be accomplished at management\u2019s discretion from time to time based on market conditions, our cash and debt position, and other factors as determined by management. Shares may be repurchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions. We may fund future share repurchases with cash generated from operations and/or proceeds from borrowings. Any repurchased shares will become treasury shares.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 49\nWe currently expect to continue to repurchase shares in the future, but such repurchases are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors, including those set forth under Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor additional information, refer to Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table sets forth information about our contractual obligations outstanding at February 29, 2020. It brings together data for easy reference from our balance sheet and Notes to the Financial Statements. For a detailed discussion of the items noted in the following table, refer to Notes 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nPayments Due By Period\nTotal\nLess than\n1 year\n1-3 years\n3-5 years\nAfter\n5 years\n(in millions)\nShort-term borrowings\n$\n238.9\n$\n238.9\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nLong-term debt (excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized discounts)\n12,021.8\n736.2\n3,511.1\n2,174.5\n5,600.0\nInterest payments on long-term debt (1)\n3,770.6\n426.0\n732.4\n515.4\n2,096.8\nOperating leases\n686.8\n94.1\n150.7\n112.3\n329.7\nOther long-term liabilities (2)\n302.9\n97.7\n94.0\n78.6\n32.6\nPurchase obligations (3)\n6,024.7\n1,413.7\n2,266.4\n1,166.7\n1,177.9\nTotal contractual obligations\n$\n23,045.7\n$\n3,006.6\n$\n6,754.6\n$\n4,047.5\n$\n9,237.0\n(1)\nInterest rates on long-term debt obligations range from 2.3% to 5.3% as of February 29, 2020. Interest payments on long-term debt do not include interest related to finance lease obligations, which represent approximately 0.2% of our total long-term debt, as amounts are not material.\n(2)\nIncludes $45.8 million associated with expected payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as of February 29, 2020, $0.5 million of which is expected to be paid in the less than one year period. The payments are reflected in the period in which we believe they will ultimately be settled based on our experience in these matters. Other long-term liabilities do not include payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $203.6 million due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. In addition, other long-term liabilities do not include expected payments for interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as amounts are not material. For a detailed discussion of these items, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\n(3)\nConsists primarily of $4,789.5 million for contracts to purchase certain raw materials and supplies over the next eighteen fiscal years and approximately $115 million for contracts to purchase equipment and services related to the construction of the Mexicali Brewery. For further information about these purchase obligations, and others, refer to \u201cCapital Expenditures\u201d below and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 50\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring Fiscal 2020, we incurred $726.5 million for capital expenditures, including $571.7 million for the Beer segment primarily for (i) our Obregon Brewery optimization and expansion, (ii) our Nava Brewery and glass production plant expansions, and (iii) our Mexicali Brewery construction (collectively, the \u201cMexico Beer Expansion Projects\u201d). Management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current business needs. We do not believe it is prudent at this time to provide capital expenditure guidance for Fiscal 2021 as we are not able to estimate the long-term impact of COVID-19, including the demand for our products and the impact on the timeframes for completion of our Mexico Beer Expansion Projects.\nIn fiscal 2017, we began construction of the Mexicali Brewery. In March 2020, a public consultation on the construction of our Mexicali Brewery was held. We have initiated early stage discussions with government officials in Mexico regarding next steps for our brewery construction project and options elsewhere in the country following the result of the public consultation. These discussions have been positive and we will continue working with government officials to mutually agree upon a path forward. In the medium-term, we have ample capacity, based on current growth forecasts and production capabilities at the Nava and Obregon breweries, to meet consumer needs. As of February 29, 2020, we recognized approximately $700 million of capital expenditures for construction in progress related to the Mexicali Brewery.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nOur results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices. We intend to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices, subject to normal competitive conditions. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices. In addition, we continue to identify on-going cost savings initiatives.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. However, certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying those policies, management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical experience, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business. Our critical accounting estimates include:\n\u2022\nFair value of financial instruments. Certain inputs and assumptions to models used to determine fair value measurements require judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. The use of certain inputs may include information derived through extrapolation or interpolation which involves management assumptions as well as valuation\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 51\ntechniques. The fair values of our financial instruments that require the application of significant judgment by management are as follows:\nCanopy investments\nEquity securities, Warrants - estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement) and Monte Carlo simulations (Level 2 fair value measurement). These valuation models use various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining contractual term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable. Management applies significant judgment in its determination of expected volatility. We consider both historical and implied volatility levels of the underlying equity security and apply limited consideration of historical peer group volatility levels.\nDebt securities, Convertible - estimated using a binomial lattice option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement), which includes an estimate of the credit spread based on the implied spread as of the issuance date of the notes. This valuation model uses various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable.\nManagement\u2019s estimate of fair value requires significant management judgment and is subject to a high degree of variability based upon market conditions, the availability of specific information and management\u2019s assumptions.\n\u2022\nGoodwill and other intangible assets. We account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories: (i) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, (ii) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization, and (iii) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. We perform annual impairment tests and re-evaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of January 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment or change in useful life might exist.\nThe guidance for goodwill impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or to proceed directly to performing a quantitative impairment test. Under the quantitative assessment, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value, including goodwill. The estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally calculated based on an income approach using the discounted cash flow method. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, a goodwill impairment will be recognized. The amount of impairment charge for goodwill is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. Our reporting units with goodwill include the Beer segment and the Wine and Spirits segment. In estimating the fair value of the reporting units, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings, and other factors. The assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are based on historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans. These assumptions reflect management\u2019s estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss for these assets. The recognition of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 52\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis using the quantitative assessment. No indication of impairment was noted for any of our reporting units, as the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value. Based on this analysis, the reporting unit with the lowest amount of estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value was the Wine and Spirits reporting unit with approximately 107% excess fair value. For Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analyses, we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for either of our reporting units.\nThe most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculation to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units in connection with the impairment testing are: (i) the discount rate, (ii) the expected long-term growth rate, and (iii) the annual cash flow projections. As of January 1, 2020, if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of goodwill, then the changes individually would not have resulted in the carrying value of the respective reporting unit\u2019s net assets, including its goodwill, exceeding its estimated fair value, which would indicate the potential for impairment and the requirement to measure the amount of impairment, if any.\nOur other intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. Customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The trademarks that were determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. The guidance for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. Under the quantitative assessment, our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method. The estimate of fair value is then compared to the carrying value of each trademark. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the trademark, then an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value. In estimating the fair value of the trademarks, management must make assumptions and projections regarding future cash flows based upon future revenues and other factors. The assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans. These assumptions reflect management\u2019s estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss for these assets. The recognition of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2020, certain continuing negative trends within our Beer segment\u2019s Ballast Point craft beer portfolio, including increased rate of revenue decline and increased competition, indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the Ballast Point craft beer trademarks might be below its carrying value. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment. As a result of this assessment, the Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset recognized an impairment loss of $11.0 million. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Beer segment\u2019s Ballast Point business recognized a trademark impairment loss of $108.0 million in connection with certain continuing negative trends within its craft beer portfolio and a change in strategy for this portfolio focused on improving profitability by rationalizing the number of product offerings while targeting distribution growth in select strategic markets. In the first\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 53\nquarter of fiscal 2018, the Beer segment\u2019s Ballast Point business recognized a trademark impairment loss of $86.8 million in connection with certain negative trends within its craft beer portfolio.\nThe most significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are: (i) the estimated royalty rate, (ii) the discount rate, (iii) the expected long-term growth rate, and (iv) the annual revenue projections. As of January 1, 2020, if we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower or used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives, then each change individually would not have resulted in any unit of accounting\u2019s carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value.\nThe guidance for divestitures requires that when some, but not all of a reporting unit is disposed of, some of the goodwill of the reporting unit should be allocated to the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of, if that portion constitutes a business. The allocation of goodwill shall be based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit remaining. This approach requires a determination of the fair value of both the business being disposed and the businesses retained within the reporting unit.\nOur estimate of fair value for the New Wine and Spirits Transactions was determined based on the expected proceeds from the transactions. The components being sold are a part of the Wine and Spirits segment and were included in our wine and spirits reporting unit. Accordingly, goodwill was allocated to the New Wine and Spirits Transactions assets held for sale based on the relative fair value of the businesses being sold compared to the relative fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill not allocated to assets held for sale remains in the wine and spirits reporting unit.\n\u2022\nAccounting for income taxes. We estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities, income taxes payable, provision for income taxes, and unrecognized tax benefit liabilities based upon various factors including, but not limited to, historical pretax operating income, future estimates of pretax operating income, differences between book and tax treatment of various items of income and expense, interpretation of tax laws, and tax planning strategies. We are subject to income taxes in Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, the U.S., and other jurisdictions. We are regularly audited by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, is audited and finally resolved.\nWe believe that all tax positions are fully supported. However, we recognize tax assets and liabilities in accordance with the FASB guidance for income tax accounting. Accordingly, we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. We measure and recognize the tax benefit from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. In addition, changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. Changes in current estimates, if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.\nWe recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our results of operations. If necessary, we recognize a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 54\nrealized. We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, historical, and projected operating results, and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The realization of deferred tax assets is evaluated by jurisdiction and the realizability of these assets can vary based on the character of the tax attribute and the carryforward periods specific to each jurisdiction. We believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our existing deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. Changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets will be reflected in our effective tax rate in the period in which they are determined.\nACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nAccounting guidance adopted for Fiscal 2020 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

    "item_7A": "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs a result of our global operating, investment, acquisition and financing activities, we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, and equity prices. To manage the volatility relating to these risks, we periodically purchase and/or sell derivative instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity swap contracts, interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock contracts. We use derivative instruments to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates, as well as to hedge economic exposures. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nForeign Currency and Commodity Price Risk\nForeign currency derivative instruments are or may be used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, forecasted foreign currency denominated sales/purchases to/from third parties as well as intercompany sales/purchases, intercompany principal and interest payments, and in connection with investments, acquisitions, or divestitures outside the U.S. As of February 29, 2020, we had exposures to foreign currency risk primarily related to the Mexican peso, euro, Canadian dollar, and New Zealand dollar. Approximately 84% of our balance sheet exposures and forecasted transactional exposures for the year ending February 28, 2021, were hedged as of February 29, 2020.\nCommodity derivative instruments are or may be used to hedge forecasted commodity purchases from third parties as either economic hedges or accounting hedges. As of February 29, 2020, exposures to commodity price risk which we are currently hedging include aluminum, corn, diesel fuel, natural gas, and wheat prices. Approximately 83% of our forecasted transactional exposures for the year ending February 28, 2021, were hedged as of February 29, 2020.\nWe have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of foreign exchange rates and commodity prices reflecting the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market. The volatility of the applicable rates and prices is dependent on many factors which cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. Losses or gains from the revaluation or settlement of the related underlying positions would substantially offset such losses or gains on the derivative instruments. The aggregate notional value, estimated fair value, and sensitivity analysis for our open foreign currency and commodity derivative instruments are summarized as follows:\nAggregate\nNotional Value\nFair Value,\nNet Asset (Liability)\nIncrease (Decrease)\nin Fair Value -\nHypothetical\n10% Adverse Change\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\n(in millions)\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n3,011.2\n$\n2,039.6\n$\n61.9\n$\n22.5\n$\n(193.3\n)\n$\n(166.5\n)\nCommodity derivative contracts\n$\n282.8\n$\n284.7\n$\n(40.3\n)\n$\n(2.9\n)\n$\n21.7\n$\n24.4\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe estimated fair value of our fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk, credit risk, and foreign currency risk. In addition, we also have variable interest rate debt outstanding (primarily LIBOR-based), certain of which includes a fixed margin subject to the same risks identified for our fixed interest rate debt.\nAs of February 29, 2020, we had $375.0 million of outstanding cash flow designated interest rate swap agreements which fixed LIBOR interest rates (to minimize interest rate volatility) on our floating LIBOR rate debt. There were no cash flow designated interest rate swap contracts outstanding as of February 28, 2019. As of February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, there were no undesignated interest rate swap contracts outstanding.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 56\nAs of February 29, 2020, we had $300.0 million of outstanding cash flow designated treasury lock agreements which fixed 10-year Treasury interest rates (to minimize interest rate volatility) on our future debt issuances. There were no cash flow designated treasury lock contracts outstanding as of February 28, 2019. As of February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, there were no undesignated treasury lock contracts outstanding.\nWe have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates reflecting the impact of a hypothetical 1% increase in the prevailing interest rates. The volatility of the applicable rates is dependent on many factors which cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy.

These investments are recognized at fair value utilizing various option-pricing models and have the potential to fluctuate from, among other items, changes in the quoted market price of the underlying equity security. We manage our equity price risk exposure by closely monitoring the financial condition, performance and outlook of Canopy Growth Corporation.\nAs of February 29, 2020, the fair value of our investments in the Canopy warrants and the Canopy convertible debt securities was $1,117.1 million, with an unrealized net gain (loss) on these investments of $(2,126.4) million recognized in our results of operations for the year ended February 29, 2020. We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of the equity price reflecting the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the quoted market price of the underlying equity security. As of February 29, 2020, such a hypothetical 10% adverse change would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of $172.0 million.\nFor additional discussion on our market risk, refer to Notes 6 and 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February 29, 2020.\nThe effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 59\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nConstellation Brands, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Constellation Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries\u2019 (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of February 29, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 29, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 29, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated April 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 60\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nRochester, New York\nApril 21, 2020\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 61\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nConstellation Brands, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Constellation Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 29, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 29, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of February 29, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated April 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAssessment of the accounting for the modification of Canopy warrants\nAs discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company modified the terms of the November 2018 Canopy warrants and certain other rights in June 2019 (the \u201cJune 2019 Warrant Modification\u201d). The accounting impacts of the June 2019 Warrant Modification included the\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 62\nrecognition of a $1,176.0 million unrealized gain on the increase in fair value of the November 2018 Canopy warrants and a $409.0 million charge against equity in earnings (losses) from the Canopy equity method investment and related activities, among other impacts described in Note 10.\nWe identified the assessment of the accounting for the June 2019 Warrant Modification as a critical audit matter because interpretation and application of the relevant accounting literature requires significant auditor judgment. In particular, the accounting for the modification involved assessments of the different types of warrants, their particular features, and the impact of those features on the classification in the financial information of Canopy.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s process to account for the June 2019 Warrant Modification, including controls related to the Company\u2019s accounting considerations of the warrants features. We assessed the accounting treatment of the June 2019 Warrant Modification through:\n\u2022\nevaluating the Company\u2019s accounting memoranda and other documentation, including application of the relevant accounting guidance;\n\u2022\ncomparing the underlying terms of the relevant documents and agreements to the Company\u2019s accounting memoranda; and\n\u2022\nindependently interpreting and applying the accounting literature to the transaction, considering alternative accounting treatments and evaluating the relative merits of the possible alternatives.\nAssessment of the measurement of fair value of the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company established policies for measuring the fair value of financial instruments, including the Canopy warrants. As of February 29, 2020, the recorded balance of the Company\u2019s investment in the Canopy warrants was $991.5 million, of which a majority relates to the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants. The Company uses option pricing models to estimate the fair value of the Canopy warrants using various market-based inputs.\nWe identified the assessment of the measurement of fair value of New November 2018 Canopy Warrants as a critical audit matter. Specifically, there was a high degree of subjectivity and judgment in evaluating the determination of the expected volatility inputs used in the option pricing models for the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants. Historical, implied, and peer group volatility levels provide a range of possible expected volatility inputs and the fair value estimates for the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants are sensitive to the expected volatility inputs.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s process to measure the fair value of the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants. This included controls related to the evaluation of observable market information used in the determination of the expected volatility inputs. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n\u2022\nevaluating the expected volatility inputs by comparing them against a volatility range that was independently developed in consideration of historical, implied, and peer group volatility information; and\n\u2022\ndeveloping an estimate of the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants\u2019 fair value using the independently developed volatility range and comparing it to the value calculated by the Company.\nEvaluation of gross unrecognized tax benefits\nAs discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. The Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest, of $249.4 million as of February 29, 2020.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 63\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company\u2019s gross unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter. Complex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the Company\u2019s interpretation of tax law and its estimate of the ultimate resolution of its tax positions.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s unrecognized tax benefit process, including controls related to the interpretation of tax law, its application in the liability estimation process, and the review of activity that could result in changes to the Company\u2019s unrecognized tax benefits. Since tax law is complex and often subject to interpretations, we involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n\u2022\nevaluating the Company\u2019s interpretation of tax laws and tax authority rulings;\n\u2022\nassessing transfer pricing studies for compliance with applicable laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nperforming an assessment of the Company\u2019s tax positions, including using sensitivity analysis, and comparing the results to the Company\u2019s assessment.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2002.\nRochester, New York\nApril 21, 2020\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFEBRUARY 29, 2020\n1.\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDescription of business\nConstellation Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries operate primarily in the beverage alcohol industry. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cCBI,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d refer to Constellation Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries. We are an international beverage alcohol company with a broad portfolio of consumer-preferred, high-end imported and craft beer brands, and higher-end wine and spirits brands.\nBasis of presentation\nPrinciples of consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our majority-owned and controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we have an equally-owned joint venture with Owens-Illinois. The joint venture owns and operates a state-of-the-art glass production plant which provides bottles exclusively for our brewery located in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico (the \u201cNava Brewery\u201d). We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of this variable interest entity and accordingly, the results of operations of the joint venture are reported in the Beer segment and are included in our consolidated results of operations. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nEquity method investments\nIf we are not required to consolidate our investment in another entity, we use the equity method when we (i) can exercise significant influence over the other entity and (ii) hold common stock and/or in-substance common stock of the other entity. Under the equity method, investments are carried at cost, plus or minus our equity in the increases and decreases in the investee\u2019s net assets after the date of acquisition. We monitor our equity method investments for factors indicating other-than-temporary impairment. Dividends received from the investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment.\nManagement\u2019s use of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSummary of significant accounting policies\nRevenue recognition\nOur revenue (referred to in our financial statements as \u201csales\u201d) consists primarily of the sale of beer, wine, and spirits domestically in the U.S. Sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed-upon credit terms. Our payment terms vary by location and customer, however, the time period between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. Our customers consist primarily of wholesale distributors. Our revenue generating activities have a single performance obligation and are recognized at the point in time when control transfers and our obligation has been fulfilled, which is when the related goods are shipped or delivered to the customer, depending upon the method of distribution, and shipping terms. We have elected to treat shipping as a fulfillment activity. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the sale of our product. Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in sales.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 70\nAs noted, the majority of our revenues are generated from the domestic sale of beer, wine, and spirits to wholesale distributors in the U.S. Our other revenue generating activities include the export of certain of our products to select international markets, as well as the sale of our products through state alcohol beverage control agencies and on-premise, retail locations in certain markets. We have evaluated these other revenue generating activities under the disaggregation disclosure criteria outlined within the amended guidance and concluded that these other revenue generating activities are immaterial for separate disclosure. See Note 23 for disclosure of net sales by product type.\nSales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs, including pricing discounts on single transactions, volume discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, coupons, and rebates. This variable consideration is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price based upon expected amounts at the time revenue for the corresponding product sale is recognized. For example, customer promotional discount programs are entered into with certain distributors for certain periods of time. The amount ultimately reimbursed to distributors is determined based upon agreed-upon promotional discounts which are applied to distributors\u2019 sales to retailers. Other common forms of variable consideration include volume rebates for meeting established sales targets, and coupons and mail-in rebates offered to the end consumer. The determination of the reduction of the transaction price for variable consideration requires that we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the timing and amounts of revenue and liabilities recognized. We estimate this variable consideration by taking into account factors such as the nature of the promotional activity, historical information, and current trends, availability of actual results and expectations of customer and consumer behavior.\nExcise taxes remitted to tax authorities are government-imposed excise taxes on our beverage alcohol products. Excise taxes are shown on a separate line item as a reduction of sales and are recognized in our results of operations when the related product sale is recognized. Excise taxes are recognized as a current liability in other accrued expenses and liabilities, with the liability subsequently reduced when the taxes are remitted to the tax authority.\nCost of product sold\nThe types of costs included in cost of product sold are raw materials, packaging materials, manufacturing costs, plant administrative support and overheads, and freight and warehouse costs (including distribution network costs). Distribution network costs include inbound freight charges and outbound shipping and handling costs, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing and internal transfer costs.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nThe types of costs included in selling, general, and administrative expenses consist predominately of advertising and non-manufacturing administrative and overhead costs. Distribution network costs are included in cost of product sold. We expense advertising costs as incurred, shown, or distributed. Advertising expense for the years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019, and February 28, 2018, was $769.5 million, $700.8 million, and $615.7 million, respectively.\nForeign currency translation\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the respective local currency. The translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recognized as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (\u201cAOCI\u201d). Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency denominated transactions are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity when purchased of three months or less and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 71\nFair value of financial instruments\nWe calculate the estimated fair value of financial instruments using quoted market prices whenever available. When quoted market prices are not available, we use standard pricing models for various types of financial instruments (such as forwards, options, swaps, and convertible debt) which take into account the present value of estimated future cash flows (see Note 7).\nDerivative instruments\nWe enter into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. We enter into derivatives for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships as well as those derivatives utilized as economic hedges. We do not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at estimated fair value (see Notes 6 and 7). We present our derivative positions gross on our balance sheets.\nThe change in the fair value of outstanding cash flow hedges is deferred in stockholders\u2019 equity as a component of AOCI. For all periods presented herein, gains or losses deferred in stockholders\u2019 equity as a component of AOCI are recognized in our results of operations in the same period in which the hedged items are recognized and on the same financial statement line item as the hedged items.\nChanges in fair values for derivative instruments not designated in a hedge accounting relationship are recognized directly in our results of operations each period and on the same financial statement line item as the hedged item. For purposes of measuring segment operating performance, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of our undesignated commodity derivative contracts, prior to settlement, is reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is recognized in the segment operating results. Upon settlement, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the undesignated commodity derivative contracts is reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing our operating segment results to reflect the economic effects of the commodity derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.\nCash flows from the settlement of derivatives, including both economic hedges and those designated in hedge accounting relationships, appear on our statements of cash flows in the same categories as the cash flows of the hedged items.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Elements of cost include materials, labor, and overhead.\nBulk wine inventories are included as in-process inventories within current assets, in accordance with the general practices of the wine industry, although a portion of such inventories may be aged for periods greater than one year. A substantial portion of barreled whiskey and brandy will not be sold within one year because of the duration of the aging process. All barreled whiskey and brandy are classified as in-process inventories and are included in current assets, in accordance with industry practice. Warehousing, insurance, value added taxes, and other carrying charges applicable to barreled whiskey and brandy held for aging are included in inventory costs.\nWe assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand, and market requirements.\nProperty, plant, and equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment is stated at cost. Major additions and improvements are recognized as an increase to the property accounts, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost of properties sold or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 72\nare eliminated from the balance sheet accounts at the time of disposal and resulting gains and losses are included as a component of operating income.\nInterest incurred relating to expansion, construction, and optimization of facilities is capitalized to construction in progress. We cease the capitalization of interest when construction activities are substantially completed and the facility and related assets are available for their intended use. At this point, construction in progress is transferred to the appropriate asset class.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:\nYears\nLand improvements\n15 to 32\nVineyards\n16 to 26\nBuildings and improvements\n10 to 50\nMachinery and equipment\n3 to 35\nMotor vehicles\n3 to 8\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\nGoodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. We review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually for impairment, or sooner, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We use January 1 as our annual impairment test measurement date. Indefinite lived intangible assets consist principally of trademarks. Intangible assets determined to have a finite life, primarily customer relationships, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to review for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Note 9 provides a summary of intangible assets segregated between amortizable and nonamortizable amounts.\nIndemnification liabilities\nWe have indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures. Indemnification liabilities are recognized when probable and estimable and included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities (see Note 17).\nIncome taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method accounts for deferred income taxes by applying statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries (\u201cGILTI\u201d) is subject to U.S. tax. We treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current period tax expense when incurred. We provide deferred income taxes, consisting primarily of foreign withholding and state taxes, on all applicable unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Interest and penalties are recognized as a component of (provision for) benefit from income taxes.\nNet income (loss) per common share attributable to CBI\nWe have two classes of common stock with a material number of shares outstanding: Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock (see Note 18). In addition, we have another class of common stock with an immaterial number of shares outstanding: Class 1 Common Stock (see Note 18). If we pay a cash dividend on Class B Convertible Common Stock, each share of Class A Common Stock will receive an amount at least ten percent greater than the amount of the cash dividend per share paid on Class B Convertible Common Stock. Class B Convertible Common Stock shares are convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis at any time at the option of the holder.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 73\nWe use the two-class method for the computation and presentation of net income (loss) per common share attributable to CBI (hereafter referred to as \u201cnet income (loss) per common share\u201d) (see Note 20). The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that calculates basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share for each class of common stock separately based on dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period. Under the two-class method, Class A Common Stock is assumed to receive a ten percent greater participation in undistributed earnings (losses) than Class B Convertible Common Stock, in accordance with the respective minimum dividend rights of each class of stock.\nNet income (loss) per common share - basic excludes the effect of common stock equivalents and is computed using the two-class method. Net income (loss) per common share - diluted for Class A Common Stock reflects the potential dilution that could result if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Net income (loss) per common share - diluted for Class A Common Stock is computed using the more dilutive of the if-converted or two-class method. Net income (loss) per common share - diluted for Class A Common Stock is computed using the if-converted method and assumes the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method and the conversion of Class B Convertible Common Stock as this method is more dilutive than the two-class method. Net income (loss) per common share - diluted for Class B Convertible Common Stock is computed using the two-class method and does not assume conversion of Class B Convertible Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock.\nStock-based employee compensation\nWe have two stock-based employee compensation plans (see Note 19). We apply grant date fair-value-based measurement methods in accounting for our stock-based payment arrangements and recognize all costs resulting from stock-based payment transactions, net of expected forfeitures, ratably over the requisite service period. Stock-based awards are subject to specific vesting conditions, generally time vesting, or upon retirement, disability, or death of the employee (as defined by the plan), if earlier. For awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, we recognize compensation expense ratably over the period from the date of grant to the date of retirement-eligibility.\nRecently adopted accounting guidance\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance for the accounting for leases. Under this guidance, a lessee recognizes assets and liabilities on its balance sheet for most leases. Lease expense continues to be consistent with previous guidance. Additionally, this guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements.\nWe adopted this guidance on March 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach, accordingly, prior period balances and disclosures have not been restated. We elected the package of transition practical expedients for expired or existing contracts, which retains prior conclusions reached on lease identification, classification, and initial direct costs incurred.\nWe finalized the implementation of changes to our accounting policies, systems and controls, including a new leasing software to capture the required data for accounting and disclosure. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets of $585.4 million and operating lease liabilities of $619.7 million as of March 1, 2019, and did not have a material impact on our results of operations or liquidity.\nFor additional information on leases, refer to Note 16.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 74\n2. ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION\nAcquisitions\nNelson\u2019s Green Brier\nIn May 2019, we increased our ownership interest in Nelson\u2019s Green Brier Distillery, LLC (\u201cNelson\u2019s Green Brier\u201d) to 75%, resulting in consolidation of the business and recognition of a 25% noncontrolling interest. This acquisition included a portfolio of award-winning, Tennessee-based craft bourbon and whiskey products. The preliminary fair value of the business combination was allocated primarily to goodwill, trademarks, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment. The results of operations of Nelson\u2019s Green Brier are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.\nWe recognized a gain of $11.8 million for the year ended February 29, 2020, related to the remeasurement of our previously held 20% equity interest in Nelson\u2019s Green Brier to the acquisition-date fair value. This gain is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated results of operations.\nOther acquisitions\nDuring the year ended February 28, 2019, we completed the acquisitions of other businesses, including the Four Corners Brewing Company LLC business, which included a portfolio of high-quality, dynamic, and bicultural, Texas-based craft beers (\u201cFour Corners\u201d), and a business in Italy, which provided additional processing and sourcing capabilities for our Italian wine portfolio. The purchase price for the Four Corners acquisition was primarily allocated to goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, and trademarks, plus an earn-out over five years based on the performance of the brands. The purchase price for the acquired business in Italy was primarily allocated to a production facility, vineyards, and inventory. The results of operations of these acquired businesses are reported in the respective segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from their respective date of acquisition.\nDuring the year ended February 28, 2018, we completed the acquisitions of other businesses, including the Funky Buddha Brewery LLC business, which included a portfolio of high-quality, Florida-based craft beers (\u201cFunky Buddha\u201d), and the Schrader Cellars, LLC business, which included a collection of highly-rated, limited-production fine wines. The total combined purchase price for these acquisitions was $149.8 million. The purchase price for each acquisition was primarily allocated to goodwill and trademarks. In addition, the purchase price for Funky Buddha includes an earn-out over five years based on the performance of the brands. The results of operations of these acquired businesses are reported in the respective segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from their respective date of acquisition.\nDivestitures\nBlack Velvet Divestiture\nOn November 1, 2019, we sold the Black Velvet Canadian Whisky business and the brand\u2019s associated production facility, along with a subset of Canadian whisky brands produced at that facility, and related inventory at a transaction value of $266.3 million (the \u201cBlack Velvet Divestiture\u201d). We received cash proceeds of $269.7 million, subject to estimated working capital adjustments. The cash proceeds were utilized to partially repay the 2.00% November 2017 Senior Notes (as defined in Note 13). The following table summarizes the net gain recognized in connection with this divestiture:\n(in millions)\nCash received from buyer\n$\n269.7\nNet assets sold\n(213.3\n)\nAOCI reclassification adjustments, primarily foreign currency translation\n20.9\nDirect costs to sell\n(3.2\n)\nGain on sale of business\n$\n74.1\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 75\nSale of Accolade Wine Investment\nIn May 2018, we completed the sale of our remaining interest in our previously-owned Australian and European business (the \u201cAccolade Wine Investment\u201d) for A$149.1 million, or $113.6 million. We received cash proceeds, net of direct costs to sell, of $111.7 million. This interest consisted of an investment accounted for under the cost method and available-for-sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) debt securities. We recognized net gains of $0.4 million and $99.8 million in connection with this transaction for the years ended February 29, 2020, and February 28,2019, respectively. These net gains are included in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments.\nBusiness transformation\nWe have committed to a business transformation strategy which aligns our portfolio with consumer-led premiumization trends and growing segments of the Wine and Spirits and Beer markets.\nWine and Spirits Transaction\nIn April 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business, including approximately 30 lower-margin, lower-growth wine and spirits brands, wineries, vineyards, offices, and facilities (the \u201cWine and Spirits Transaction\u201d).\nNew Wine and Spirits Transactions\nIn December 2019, we agreed to revise and supersede the Wine and Spirits Transaction. The revisions to the transaction address competitive concerns raised by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) specifically related to the sparkling wine, brandy, dessert wine, and concentrate categories. As a result, the brands Cook\u2019s California Champagne, J. Roget American Champagne, Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy, and our concentrate business will be excluded from the transaction resulting in an adjusted transaction price of approximately $843 million, with the potential to earn an incremental $250 million of contingent consideration if certain brand performance provisions are met over a two-year period after closing (the \u201cRevised Wine and Spirits Transaction\u201d). The Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction is expected to close around the end of first quarter of fiscal 2021, and is subject to required regulatory clearances and governmental review and approval. Additionally, in a separate, but related, transaction, we agreed that upon execution and delivery of a definitive agreement for the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction, we would enter into an agreement to sell the New Zealand-based Nobilo Wine brand and certain related assets for $130 million (the \u201cNobilo Wine Transaction\u201d). The Nobilo Wine Transaction is expected to close by the end of second quarter of fiscal 2021 and is subject to FTC and New Zealand regulatory review and approval. Completion of the Nobilo Transaction is also conditioned on completion of the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction. We expect to use the net cash proceeds from the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction and the Nobilo Wine Transaction (collectively, the \u201cNew Wine and Spirits Transactions\u201d) primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings.\nWe have communicated our intent to retain the brands Cook\u2019s California Champagne and J. Roget American Champagne contemplated under the Wine and Spirits Transaction and the FTC is currently reviewing our business plans to support these brands in the future.\nOther Wine and Spirits Transactions\nWe are pursuing other opportunities to divest the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy brand and concentrate business excluded from the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction to companies with more aligned business strategies (the \u201cOther Wine and Spirits Transactions\u201d).\nBallast Point Transaction\nIn December 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Ballast Point craft beer business, including a number of its associated production facilities and brewpubs, (the \u201cBallast Point Transaction\u201d). See \u201cSubsequent Event - Divestiture\u201d below.\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 76\nAssets held for sale\nIn contemplation of the transactions noted above, certain net assets have met the held for sale criteria as of February 29, 2020.

FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 78\nSubsequent event\nMexicali Brewery\nIn fiscal 2017, we began construction of a new, state-of-the-art brewery located in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico (the \u201cMexicali Brewery\u201d). In March 2020, a public consultation was held on the construction of the Mexicali Brewery. We have initiated early stage discussions with government officials in Mexico regarding next steps for our brewery construction project and options elsewhere in the country following the result of the public consultation. These discussions have been positive and we will continue working with government officials to mutually agree upon a path forward. In the medium-term, we have ample capacity, based on current growth forecasts and production capabilities at the Nava and Obregon breweries, to meet consumer needs. As of February 29, 2020, we recognized approximately $700 million of capital expenditures for construction in progress and had an additional $275 million of committed costs, a portion of which are included in purchase commitments as they have a remaining contract term greater than one year (see Note 17).\n6. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nOverview\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, and equity prices that could affect our results of operations and financial condition. The impact on our results and financial position and the amounts reported in our financial statements will vary based upon the currency, commodity, interest rate, and equity market movements during the period, the effectiveness and level of derivative instruments outstanding, and whether they are designated and qualify for hedge accounting.\nThe estimated fair values of our derivative instruments change with fluctuations in currency rates, commodity prices, interest rates, and/or equity prices and are expected to offset changes in the values of the underlying exposures. Our derivative instruments are held solely to manage our exposures to the aforementioned market risks as part of our normal business operations. We follow strict policies to manage these risks and do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe have investments in certain equity securities and other rights which provide us with the option to purchase an additional ownership interest in the equity securities of Canopy (see Note 10). These investments are included in securities measured at fair value and are accounted for at fair value, with the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of these investments recognized in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments (see Note 7).\nThe aggregate notional value of outstanding derivative instruments is as follows:\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\n(in millions)\nDerivative instruments designated as hedging instruments\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n1,831.0\n$\n1,579.3\nInterest rate swap contracts\n$\n375.0\n$\n-\nTreasury lock contracts\n$\n300.0\n$\n-\nDerivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n1,180.2\n$\n460.3\nCommodity derivative contracts\n$\n282.8\n$\n284.7\nCash flow hedges\nOur derivative instruments designated in hedge accounting relationships are designated as cash flow hedges. We are exposed to foreign denominated cash flow fluctuations primarily in connection with third party and intercompany sales and purchases. We primarily use foreign currency forward contracts\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 79\nto hedge certain of these risks. In addition, we utilize interest rate swap and treasury lock contracts periodically to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivatives managing our cash flow exposures generally mature within three years or less, with a maximum maturity of five years.\nTo qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the details of the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risk that is being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed, and how ineffectiveness will be measured. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the risk being hedged. Throughout the term of the designated cash flow hedge relationship on at least a quarterly basis, a retrospective evaluation and prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is performed based on quantitative and qualitative measures. All components of our derivative instruments\u2019 gains or losses are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\nWhen we determine that a derivative instrument which qualified for hedge accounting treatment has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. In the event the relationship is no longer effective, we recognize the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative instrument from the date the hedging derivative instrument became no longer effective immediately in our results of operations. We also discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (i) a derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (ii) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (iii) we determine that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, but the original forecasted transaction continues to be probable of occurring, the existing gain or loss of the derivative instrument remains in AOCI and is reclassified into earnings (losses) when the forecasted transaction occurs. When it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, any remaining gain or loss in AOCI is recognized immediately in our results of operations.\nWe expect $39.5 million of net gains, net of income tax effect, to be reclassified from AOCI to our results of operations within the next 12 months.\nUndesignated hedges\nCertain of our derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment; for others, we choose not to maintain the required documentation to apply hedge accounting treatment. These undesignated instruments are primarily used to economically hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables; foreign currency investments, primarily consisting of loans to subsidiaries and foreign-denominated investments, and cash flows related primarily to the repatriation of those loans or investments; and commodity prices, including aluminum, corn, diesel fuel, natural gas, and wheat prices. We primarily use foreign currency forward and option contracts, generally less than 12 months in duration, and commodity swap contracts, generally less than 36 months in duration, with a maximum maturity of five years, to hedge some of these risks. In addition, from time to time, we utilize interest rate swap contracts, generally less than six months in duration, to economically hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates associated with the financing of significant investments and acquisitions. Our derivative policy permits the use of undesignated derivatives as approved by senior management.\nCredit risk\nWe are exposed to credit-related losses if the counterparties to our derivative contracts default. This credit risk is limited to the fair value of the derivative contracts. To manage this risk, we contract only with major financial institutions that have earned investment-grade credit ratings and with whom we have standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements which allow for net settlement of the derivative contracts. We have also established counterparty credit guidelines that are regularly monitored. Because of these safeguards, we believe the risk of loss from counterparty default to be immaterial.\nIn addition, our derivative instruments are not subject to credit rating contingencies or collateral requirements. As of February 29, 2020, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments in a net liability\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nAuthoritative guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value, including a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy includes three levels:\n\u2022\nLevel 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n\u2022\nLevel 2 inputs include data points that are observable such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) such as volatility, interest\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 82\nrates and yield curves that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly; and\n\u2022\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.\nFair value methodology\nThe following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value for each class of our financial instruments:\nForeign currency and commodity derivative contracts\nThe fair value is estimated using market-based inputs, obtained from independent pricing services, entered into valuation models. These valuation models require various inputs, including contractual terms, market foreign exchange prices, market commodity prices, interest-rate yield curves, and currency volatilities, as applicable (Level 2 fair value measurement).\nInterest rate swap and treasury lock contracts\nThe fair value is estimated based on quoted market prices from respective counterparties. Quotes are corroborated by using discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interest-rate yield curves, which are obtained from independent pricing services (Level 2 fair value measurement).\nCanopy investments\nEquity securities, Warrants - The terms of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants were modified in June 2019 and now consist of three tranches of warrants: New Tranche A Warrants, New Tranche B Warrants, and New Tranche C Warrants. The exercise price for the New Tranche C Warrants is based on the volume-weighted average of the closing market price of Canopy\u2019s common shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange (\u201cTSX\u201d) for the five trading days immediately preceding the exercise date (\u201cVWAP Exercise Price\u201d), accordingly, no fair value is assigned.

We have elected the fair value option to account for the Canopy Debt Securities, which, at that time, provided the greatest level of consistency with the accounting treatment for the November 2017 Canopy Warrants. Interest income on the Canopy Debt Securities is calculated using the effective interest method and is recognized separately from the changes in fair value in interest expense. The Canopy Debt Securities have a contractual maturity of five years from the date of issuance, but may be converted prior to maturity by either party upon the occurrence of certain events. At settlement, the Canopy Debt Securities can be settled at the option of the issuer, in cash, equity shares of the issuer, or a combination thereof. The fair value is estimated using a binomial lattice option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement), which includes an estimate of the credit spread based on the implied spread as of the issuance date of the notes.\nThe inputs used to estimate the fair value of the Canopy Debt Securities are as follows:\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\nConversion price (1)\nC$\n48.17\nC$\n48.17\nValuation date stock price (2)\nC$\n25.17\nC$\n62.38\nRemaining term (3)\n3.4 years\n4.4 years\nExpected volatility (4)\n58.2\n%\n45.9\n%\nRisk-free interest rate (5)\n1.1\n%\n1.8\n%\nExpected dividend yield (6)\n0.0\n%\n0.0\n%\n(1)\nBased on the rate which the Canopy Debt Securities may be converted into equity shares, or the equivalent amount of cash, at the option of the issuer.\n(2)\nBased on the closing market price for Canopy common stock on the TSX as of the applicable date.\n(3)\nBased on the contractual maturity date of the notes.\n(4)\nBased on historical volatility levels of the underlying equity security reduced to account for certain risks not incorporated into the option-pricing model.\n(5)\nBased on the implied yield currently available on Canadian Treasury zero coupon issues with a term equal to the remaining contractual term of the debt securities.\n(6)\nBased on historical dividend levels.\nShort-term borrowings\nThe revolving credit facility under our senior credit facility is a variable interest rate bearing note which includes a fixed margin which is adjustable based upon our debt rating (as defined in our senior credit facility). Its fair value is estimated by discounting cash flows using LIBOR plus a margin reflecting current market conditions obtained from participating member financial institutions (Level 2 fair value measurement). The remaining instruments, including our commercial paper, are variable interest rate bearing notes for which the carrying value approximates the fair value.\nLong-term debt\nThe term loans under our Term Credit Agreement and 2019 Term Credit Agreement (both as defined in Note 13) are variable interest rate bearing notes which include a fixed margin which is adjustable based upon our debt rating. The senior floating rate notes are variable interest rate bearing notes which include a fixed margin. The fair value of the term loans and the senior floating rate notes are estimated by discounting cash flows using LIBOR plus a margin reflecting current market conditions obtained from participating member financial institutions (Level 2 fair value measurement). The fair value of the remaining long-term debt, which is primarily fixed interest rate, is estimated by discounting cash\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 84\nflows using interest rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities (Level 2 fair value measurement).\nThe carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings, approximate fair value as of February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. As of February 29, 2020, the carrying amount of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $11,945.7 million, compared with an estimated fair value of $12,935.9 million. As of February 28, 2019, the carrying amount of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $12,825.0 million, compared with an estimated fair value of $12,768.5 million.\nRecurring basis measurements\nThe following table presents our financial assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis:\nFair Value Measurements Using\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive\nMarkets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3)\nTotal\n(in millions)\nFebruary 29, 2020\nAssets:\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n-\n$\n96.3\n$\n-\n$\n96.3\nCommodity derivative contracts\n$\n-\n$\n0.6\n$\n-\n$\n0.6\nEquity securities (1)\n$\n-\n$\n991.5\n$\n-\n$\n991.5\nCanopy Debt Securities (1)\n$\n-\n$\n125.6\n$\n-\n$\n125.6\nLiabilities:\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n-\n$\n34.4\n$\n-\n$\n34.4\nCommodity derivative contracts\n$\n-\n$\n40.9\n$\n-\n$\n40.9\nInterest rate swap contracts\n$\n-\n$\n0.8\n$\n-\n$\n0.8\nTreasury lock contracts\n$\n-\n$\n7.6\n$\n-\n$\n7.6\nFebruary 28, 2019\nAssets:\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n-\n$\n38.2\n$\n-\n$\n38.2\nCommodity derivative contracts\n$\n-\n$\n8.7\n$\n-\n$\n8.7\nEquity securities (1)\n$\n-\n$\n3,023.2\n$\n-\n$\n3,023.2\nCanopy Debt Securities (1)\n$\n-\n$\n211.5\n$\n-\n$\n211.5\nLiabilities:\nForeign currency contracts\n$\n-\n$\n15.7\n$\n-\n$\n15.7\nCommodity derivative contracts\n$\n-\n$\n11.6\n$\n-\n$\n11.6\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

For the third quarter and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, in connection with the New Wine and Spirits Transactions, additional losses of $340.0 million and $20.0 million were recognized, respectively. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, in connection with the Other Wine and Spirits Transactions, long-lived assets held for sale were written down to their estimated fair value, less costs to sell, resulting in a loss of $20.0 million. Of the total Wine and Spirits segment long-lived assets held for sale with a carrying value of $1,479.4 million, $1,291.2 million were written down to their current estimated fair value of $908.2 million, less costs to sell, resulting in a total loss of $407.0 million for the year ended February 29, 2020. This loss is included in impairment of assets held for sale. These assets consisted primarily of goodwill, intangible assets, and certain winery and vineyard assets which had satisfied the conditions necessary to be classified as held for sale. Our estimate of fair value was\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 86\ndetermined based on the expected proceeds from the New Wine and Spirits Transactions and Other Wine and Spirits Transactions, excluding the contingent consideration, which we will recognize when it is determined to be realizable.\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2020, in connection with the Ballast Point Transaction, long-lived assets held for sale were written down to their estimated fair value, less costs to sell, resulting in a loss of $50.0 million. Subsequently, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, a reduction to the loss on long-lived assets held for sale of $7.3 million was recognized. The long-lived assets held for sale with a carrying value of $77.8 million were written down to their estimated fair value of $41.1 million, less costs to sell. As a result, a loss of $42.7 million, inclusive of costs to sell and other losses is included in impairment of assets held for sale for the year ended February 29, 2020. These assets consisted primarily of intangible assets and certain production and warehouse assets which had satisfied the conditions necessary to be classified as held for sale. Our estimate of fair value was determined based on the expected proceeds from the Ballast Point Transaction. The Ballast Point craft beer portfolio is a component of the Beer segment and was included in our beer reporting unit. Accordingly, goodwill was allocated to the Ballast Point craft beer portfolio assets held for sale based on the relative fair value of the business being sold compared to the relative fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill not allocated to assets held for sale remains in the beer reporting unit.\nTrademarks\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2020, certain continuing negative trends within our Beer segment\u2019s Ballast Point craft beer portfolio, including increased rate of revenue decline and increased competition, indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the Ballast Point craft beer trademarks might be below its carrying value. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment. As a result of this assessment, the Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset with a carrying value of $28.0 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $17.0 million, resulting in an impairment of $11.0 million. This impairment is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended February 29, 2020. The Ballast Point craft beer trademarks have been reclassified to assets held for sale as of February 29, 2020.\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, in connection with certain continuing negative trends within our Beer segment\u2019s Ballast Point craft beer portfolio, including slower growth rates and increased competition, we implemented a change in strategy for our Ballast Point craft beer portfolio. This change in strategy, when combined with the continuing negative trends, indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset associated with the craft beer trademarks might be below its carrying value. The change in strategy for our Ballast Point craft beer portfolio focuses on improving profitability by rationalizing the number of product offerings while targeting distribution growth in select strategic markets. This change in strategy resulted in updated long-term financial forecasts with lower revenues, and cash flows for the related portfolio. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment of the Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset. As a result of this assessment, the Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset with a carrying value of $136.0 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $28.0 million, resulting in an impairment of $108.0 million.\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we identified certain negative trends within our Beer segment\u2019s Ballast Point craft beer portfolio which, when combined with the then-recent negative craft beer industry trends, including slower growth rates and increased competition, indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset associated with the craft beer trademarks might be below its carrying value. These negative trends were the result of (i) a disruption in our distribution network transition plan, (ii) an unexpected decrease in sales from product innovations, and (iii) a significant shift in market conditions for our craft beer portfolio, all of which resulted in a decline in net sales and depletion trends, which represent distributor shipments of our branded products to retail customers, for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Additionally, net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were below our forecasted net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment of the craft beer trademark asset. As a result of this assessment, the craft beer trademark asset with a carrying value of\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 87\n$222.8 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $136.0 million, resulting in an impairment of $86.8 million.\nWhen performing a quantitative assessment for impairment of a trademark asset, we measure the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of the trademark asset exceeds its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is determined based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method, which assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of the trademark asset. The cash flow projections we use to estimate the fair value of our trademark assets involve several assumptions, including (i) projected revenue growth rates, (ii) estimated royalty rates, (iii) after-tax royalty savings expected from ownership of the trademarks, and (iv) discount rates used to derive the estimated fair value of the trademark assets.\n8.

The November 2017 Canopy Warrants have been accounted for at fair value from the date of investment.\nOn November 1, 2018, we increased our ownership interest in Canopy by acquiring an additional 104.5 million common shares (the \u201cNovember 2018 Canopy Investment\u201d) (see Canopy Equity Method Investment below), plus warrants which give us the option to purchase an additional 139.7 million common shares of Canopy (the \u201cNovember 2018 Canopy Warrants\u201d, and together with the November 2018 Canopy Investment, the \u201cNovember 2018 Canopy Transaction\u201d) for C$5,078.7 million, or $3,869.9 million.\nOn November 1, 2018, our ownership interest in Canopy increased to 36.6% which allows us to exercise significant influence, but not control, over Canopy. Therefore, we account for the November 2017 Canopy Investment and the November 2018 Canopy Investment, each of which represents an investment in common shares of Canopy, collectively, under the equity method (the \u201cCanopy Equity Method Investment\u201d). We recognize equity in earnings (losses) and related activities for this investment on a two-month lag. Accordingly, we recognized equity in earnings (losses) and related activities of $(575.9) million for the period January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2019, in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended February 29, 2020, and $(2.6) million for the period November 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018, in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended February 28, 2019. Equity in earnings (losses) from the Canopy Equity Method Investment and related activities for the years ended February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, include, among other items, the amortization of the fair value adjustments associated with the definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, the flow through of inventory step-up, and unrealized gains (losses) associated with changes in our Canopy ownership percentage resulting from periodic equity issuances made by Canopy. In addition to the items noted above, the year ended February 29, 2020, includes our share of the additional loss resulting from the June 2019 Warrant Modification (as defined below) of $(409.0) million (the \u201cJune 2019 Warrant Modification Loss\u201d).\nThe November 2018 Canopy Warrants originally consisted of 88.5 million warrants (the \u201cTranche A Warrants\u201d) and 51.2 million warrants (the \u201cTranche B Warrants\u201d). The Tranche A Warrants were immediately exercisable at an exercise price of C$50.40 per warrant share. The Tranche B Warrants were exercisable upon the exercise, in full, of the Tranche A Warrants and at an exercise price based on the volume-weighted average of the closing market price of Canopy\u2019s common shares on the TSX for the five trading days immediately preceding the exercise date. The November 2018 Canopy Warrants originally expired in November 2021 and have been accounted for at fair value from the date of investment.\nIn June 2019, the Canopy shareholders approved the modification of the terms of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants and certain other rights (the \u201cJune 2019 Warrant Modification\u201d), and the other required approvals necessary for the modifications to be effective were granted. These changes are the result of Canopy\u2019s intention to acquire Acreage Holdings, Inc. (\u201cAcreage\u201d) upon U.S. Federal cannabis legalization, subject to certain conditions (the \u201cAcreage Transaction\u201d). As a result of the modifications, we continue to have the option to purchase an additional 139.7 million common shares of Canopy upon exercise of the warrants originally received in November 2018; however, this option now consists of three tranches of warrants, including 88.5 million warrants (the \u201cNew Tranche A Warrants\u201d), 38.4 million warrants (the \u201cNew Tranche B Warrants\u201d), and 12.8 million warrants (the \u201cNew Tranche C Warrants\u201d, and collectively with the New Tranche A Warrants and the New Tranche B Warrants, the \u201cNew November 2018 Canopy Warrants\u201d). The New Tranche A Warrants have an exercise price of C$50.40 per warrant share and are currently exercisable, but now expire November 1, 2023. The New Tranche B Warrants now have an exercise price of C$76.68 per warrant share and the New Tranche C Warrants have a VWAP Exercise\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 90\nPrice. The New Tranche B Warrants and the New Tranche C Warrants now have an expiration date of November 1, 2026.\nThe other rights obtained in June 2019 in connection with the Acreage Transaction include a share repurchase credit and the ability to purchase Canopy common shares on the open market or in private agreement transactions. If for any reason Canopy has not purchased the lesser of 27,378,866 Canopy common shares or C$1,583.0 million worth of Canopy common shares for cancellation between April 18, 2019 and two-years after the full exercise of the New Tranche A Warrants, we will be credited an amount that will reduce the aggregate exercise price otherwise payable upon each exercise of the New Tranche B Warrants and New Tranche C Warrants. The credit will be an amount equal to the difference between the actual price paid by Canopy in purchasing its common shares for cancellation and C$1,583.0 million. If we choose to purchase Canopy common shares on the open market or in private agreement with existing holders, the number of New Tranche B Warrants or New Tranche C Warrants shall be decreased by one for each Canopy common share acquired, up to an aggregate maximum reduction of 20 million warrants. The likelihood of receiving the share repurchase credit if we were to fully exercise the New Tranche A Warrants is remote, therefore, no fair value has been assigned.\nThe inputs used to estimate the fair value of the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants as of the June 27, 2019 modification date, are as follows:\nNew\nTranche A Warrants (1)\nNew\nTranche B Warrants (1)\nExercise price\nC$\n50.40\nC$\n76.68\nValuation date stock price\nC$\n53.36\nC$\n53.36\nRemaining contractual term\n4.3 years\n7.3 years\nExpected volatility\n66.7\n%\n66.7\n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n1.4\n%\n1.4\n%\nExpected dividend yield\n0.0\n%\n0.0\n%\n(1)\nRefer to Note 7 for input descriptions.\nAccordingly, we recognized a $1,176.0 million unrealized gain from unconsolidated investments in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 from the June 2019 Warrant Modification. Approximately $322.5 million of the unrealized gain was associated with the New Tranche A Warrants and $853.5 million was associated with the New Tranche B Warrants. No value was associated with the New Tranche C Warrants as they have a VWAP Exercise Price. As the expiration dates of the New Tranche A Warrants and New Tranche B Warrants were extended, we now utilize a blend of Canopy\u2019s historical volatility, implied volatility, and limited consideration of historical peer group volatility in our valuations to supplement the limited trading history.\nCanopy has various convertible equity securities outstanding, including primarily equity awards granted to its employees and options and warrants issued to various third parties, including our November 2017 Canopy Warrants, New November 2018 Canopy Warrants, Canopy Debt Securities, and the Acreage Call Option (as defined below). As of February 29, 2020, the conversion of Canopy equity securities held by its employees and/or held by other third parties, excluding our November 2017 Canopy Warrants, New November 2018 Canopy Warrants, Canopy Debt Securities, and the Acreage Call Option, would not have a significant effect on our share of Canopy\u2019s reported earnings or losses. Additionally, under an amended and restated investor rights agreement, we have the option to purchase additional common shares of Canopy at the then-current price of the underlying equity security to allow us to maintain our relative ownership interest. If we exercised all of our outstanding November 2017 Canopy Warrants and New November 2018 Canopy Warrants, it could have a significant effect on our share of Canopy\u2019s reported earnings or losses and our ownership interest in Canopy would be expected to increase to greater than 50 percent. In connection with the Acreage Transaction, Canopy has a call option to acquire 100% of the shares of Acreage (the \u201cAcreage Call Option\u201d), which would require the issuance of\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 91\nCanopy shares. If Canopy exercised the Acreage Call Option it could have a significant effect on our share of Canopy\u2019s reported earnings or losses and our ownership interest in Canopy would decrease and no longer be expected to be greater than 50 percent.\nAs of February 29, 2020, the exercise of all Canopy warrants held by us would have required a cash outflow of approximately $6.0 billion based on the terms of the November 2017 Canopy Warrants and the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants. Additionally, as of February 29, 2020, the fair value of the Canopy Equity Method Investment was $2,316.3 million based on the closing price of the underlying equity security as of that date. When compared to the carrying value of the Canopy Equity Method Investment, this fair value indicates that the investment was impaired by $595.4 million. We have evaluated the Canopy Equity Method Investment as of February 29, 2020, and determined that there was not an other-than-temporary-impairment. Our conclusion was based on several contributing factors, including: (i) the period of time for which the fair value has been less than the carrying value, (ii) an expectation that Canopy\u2019s operating results will improve, (iii) an expectation that the Canopy stock price will recover in the near term, and (iv) our ability and intent to hold the investment until that recovery. We will continue to review the Canopy Equity Method Investment for an other-than-temporary-impairment. There may be a future impairment of our Canopy Equity Method Investment if Canopy\u2019s stock price does not recover in the near term or our expectations about Canopy\u2019s prospective operating results and cash flows decline, which could be influenced by a variety of factors including adverse market conditions and the economic impact of COVID-19.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information for Canopy presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We recognize our equity in earnings (losses) for Canopy on a two-month lag. Accordingly, we recognized our share of Canopy\u2019s earnings (losses) for the period January through December 2019 in our year ended February 29, 2020 results. We recognized our share of Canopy\u2019s earnings (losses) from November and December 2018, in our year ended February 28, 2019 results. The amounts shown represent 100% of Canopy\u2019s financial position and results of operations, however, they exclude the impact of the June 2019 Warrant Modification Loss from the year ended February 29, 2020 results, as it was recorded by Canopy within equity.\nFebruary 29, 2020\nFebruary 28, 2019\n(in millions)\nCurrent assets\n$\n2,232.9\n$\n3,800.7\nNoncurrent assets\n$\n3,751.6\n$\n2,466.0\nCurrent liabilities\n$\n322.0\n$\n216.8\nNoncurrent liabilities\n$\n867.9\n$\n668.2\nNoncontrolling interests\n$\n210.5\n$\n143.3\nFor the Years Ended\nFebruary 29, 2020\nFebruary 28, 2019 (1)\n(in millions)\nNet sales\n$\n290.2\n$\n48.6\nGross profit (loss)\n$\n45.4\n$\n11.2\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(327.0\n)\n$\n(39.6\n)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Canopy\n$\n(312.6\n)\n$\n(27.8\n)\n(1)\nFor the period November 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018.\nSubsequent event\nIn March 2020, Canopy announced its plans to close two Canadian greenhouse facilities as part of its efforts to align supply and demand while improving production efficiencies over time. In April 2020, Canopy announced its plans to close an additional Canadian greenhouse facility, exit its operations in\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 92\nAfrica, and reduce Latin America and United States cultivation activities. Canopy expects to record an estimated pre-tax loss of approximately C$700 million to C$800 million in their fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 results from the facilities closures as well as other changes related to its organizational and strategic review. We will record our proportional share of Canopy\u2019s estimated pre-tax loss of approximately C$245 million to C$280 million, in our first quarter of fiscal 2021 results.\n11.

The principal changes effected by the 2017 Restatement Agreement were:\n\u2022\nThe refinance and increase of the existing U.S. Term A-1 loan facility by $261.1 million to $500.0 million and extension of its maturity to July 14, 2024;\n\u2022\nThe creation of a new $2.0 billion European Term A loan facility into which the then-existing European Term A loan facility, European Term A-1 loan facility, and European Term A-2 loan facility were combined;\n\u2022\nThe increase of the revolving credit facility by $350.0 million to $1.5 billion and extension of its maturity to July 14, 2022; and\n\u2022\nThe removal of CIHH as a borrower under the 2017 Restatement Agreement.\nIn addition, the Company and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries executed an amended and restated guarantee agreement which, among other things, released certain of our U.S. subsidiaries as guarantors of borrowings under the 2017 Credit Agreement. Furthermore, the European Borrowers executed an amended and restated cross-guarantee agreement which, among other things, removed CIHH as a party to the amended and restated cross-guarantee agreement.\nIn November 2017, we repaid the outstanding obligations under the European Term A loan facility under the 2017 Credit Agreement primarily with proceeds from the November 2017 senior notes.\nIn August 2018, the Company, CIH, CB International, certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries as guarantors, the Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders entered into a Restatement Agreement (the \u201cAugust 2018 Restatement Agreement\u201d) that amended and restated the 2017 Credit Agreement (as amended and restated by the August 2018 Restatement Agreement, the \u201cAugust 2018 Credit Agreement\u201d). The principal changes effected by the August 2018 Restatement Agreement were:\n\u2022\nThe removal of CIH as a borrower under the August 2018 Credit Agreement;\n\u2022\nThe termination of a cross-guarantee agreement by the European Borrowers; and\n\u2022\nThe addition of a mechanism to provide for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative benchmark rate in certain circumstances where LIBOR cannot be adequately ascertained or available.\nIn September 2018, the Company, CB International, certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries as guarantors, the Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders entered into a Restatement Agreement (the \u201c2018 Restatement Agreement\u201d) that amended and restated the August 2018 Credit Agreement (as amended and restated by the 2018 Restatement Agreement, the \u201c2018 Credit Agreement\u201d). The primary change effected by the 2018 Restatement Agreement was the increase of the revolving credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion and extension of its maturity to September 14, 2023. The 2018 Restatement Agreement also modified certain financial covenants in connection with the November 2018 Canopy Transaction and added various representations and warranties, covenants, and an event of default related to the November 2018 Canopy Transaction.\nIn June 2019, we repaid the outstanding obligations under the U.S. Term A-1 loan facility under the 2018 Credit Agreement with proceeds from the 2019 Term Credit Agreement (as defined below).\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 94\nTerm Credit Agreement\nIn September 2018, the Company, the Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders entered into a term loan credit agreement (the \u201cTerm Credit Agreement\u201d). The Term Credit Agreement provides for aggregate credit facilities of $1.5 billion, consisting of a $500.0 million three-year term loan facility (the \u201cThree-Year Term Facility\u201d) and a $1.0 billion five-year term loan facility (the \u201cFive-Year Term Facility\u201d).\nThe Three-Year Term Facility is not subject to amortization payments, with the balance due and payable at maturity. The Five-Year Term Facility will be repaid in quarterly payments of principal equal to 1.25% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Five-Year Term Facility, with the balance due and payable at maturity.\n2019 Term Credit Agreement\nIn June 2019, the Company and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and lender (the \u201cLender\u201d) entered into a term loan credit agreement (the \u201c2019 Term Credit Agreement\u201d). The 2019 Term Credit Agreement provides for the creation of a $491.3 million five-year term loan facility (the \u201c2019 Five-Year Term Facility\u201d). The 2019 Five-Year Term Facility will be repaid in quarterly payments of principal equal to 1.25% of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Five-Year Term Facility, with the balance due and payable at maturity.\nGeneral\nThe obligations under the 2018 Credit Agreement, the Term Credit Agreement, and the 2019 Term Credit Agreement were guaranteed by certain of our U.S. subsidiaries. We and our subsidiaries are subject to covenants that are contained in the 2018 Credit Agreement, the Term Credit Agreement, and the 2019 Term Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness) by subsidiaries that are not guarantors, additional liens, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions, and thresholds. The financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net leverage ratio.\nOur senior credit facility permits us to elect, subject to the willingness of existing or new lenders to fund such increase or term loans and other customary conditions, to increase the revolving credit commitments or add one or more tranches of additional term loans (the \u201cIncremental Facilities\u201d). The Incremental Facilities may be an unlimited amount so long as our leverage ratio, as defined and computed pursuant to our senior credit facility, is no greater than 4.00 to 1.00 subject to certain limitations for the period defined pursuant to our senior credit facility.\nThe 2018 Credit Agreement, the Term Credit Agreement and the 2019 Term Credit Agreement were subsequently amended as described below.\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

Our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the amount available under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 Credit Agreement. As of February 29, 2020, we had $238.9 million of outstanding borrowings, net of unamortized discount, under our commercial paper program with a weighted average annual interest rate of 1.9% and a weighted average remaining term of 8 days.

As of February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, amounts outstanding under these arrangements were $25.3 million and $28.9 million, respectively, the majority of which is classified as long-term as of the respective date. These arrangements primarily support the financing needs of our domestic and foreign subsidiary operations (see \u201cOther long-term debt\u201d for\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

The TCJ Act significantly changes U.S. corporate income taxes by, among other items, lowering the federal statutory rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax, and imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In December 2017, the SEC issued guidance related to the income tax accounting implications of the TCJ Act. This guidance provides a measurement period, which extends no longer than one year from the\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 100\nenactment date of the TCJ Act, during which a company may complete its accounting for the income tax implications of the TCJ Act. In accordance with this guidance, we recognized a provisional net income tax benefit of $351.2 million for the year ended February 28, 2018. This amount is comprised primarily of (i) a benefit of $311.2 million from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new, lower federal statutory rate and (ii) a benefit of $220.0 million from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities previously provided for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries which were not considered to be indefinitely reinvested; partially offset by the recording of the mandatory one-time transition tax of $180.0 million on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed our analysis of the income tax implications of the TCJ Act. We recognized an additional income tax benefit of $37.6 million resulting from a decrease in the mandatory one-time transition tax on unremitted earnings of our foreign businesses.\nA reconciliation of the total tax provision (benefit) to the amount computed by applying the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before provision for (benefit from) income taxes is as follows:\nFor the Years Ended\nFebruary 29, 2020\nFebruary 28, 2019\nFebruary 28, 2018\nAmount\n% of\nPretax\nIncome (Loss)\nAmount\n% of\nPretax\nIncome (Loss)\nAmount\n% of\nPretax\nIncome (Loss)\n(in millions, except % of pretax income (loss) data)\nIncome tax provision (benefit) at statutory rate\n$\n(198.5\n)\n21.0\n%\n$\n870.5\n21.0\n%\n$\n765.4\n32.7\n%\nState and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit (1)\n(82.3\n)\n8.7\n%\n81.3\n2.0\n%\n18.0\n0.8\n%\nNet income tax provision (benefit) from legislative changes (2)\n(547.4\n)\n57.9\n%\n(37.6\n)\n(0.9\n%)\n(351.2\n)\n(15.0\n%)\nEarnings taxed at other than U.S. statutory rate (3)\n(46.5\n)\n5.0\n%\n(81.0\n)\n(1.9\n%)\n(323.9\n)\n(13.9\n%)\nExcess tax benefits from stock-based compensation awards (4)\n(56.2\n)\n5.9\n%\n(82.9\n)\n(2.0\n%)\n(68.6\n)\n(2.9\n%)\nNet income tax provision (benefit) recognized for adjustment to valuation allowance\n(32.8\n)\n3.5\n%\n(74.1\n)\n(1.8\n%)\n4.8\n0.2\n%\nMiscellaneous items, net\n(2.9\n)\n0.3\n%\n9.7\n0.1\n%\n(21.8\n)\n(0.9\n%)\nIncome tax provision (benefit) at effective rate\n$\n(966.6\n)\n102.3\n%\n$\n685.9\n16.5\n%\n$\n22.7\n1.0\n%\n(1)\nIncludes differences resulting from adjustments to the current and deferred state effective tax rates.\n(2)\nThe year ended February 29, 2020, represents the recognition of a net income tax benefit resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets in connection with the September 2019 enactment of tax reform in Switzerland.

In making this assessment, we consider the projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income as well as tax planning strategies. Based upon this assessment, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of any valuation allowances.\nAs of February 29, 2020, operating loss carryforwards, which are primarily state and foreign, totaling $1.5 billion are being carried forward in a number of jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. Of these operating loss carryforwards, $1.4 billion will expire in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2040 and $87.4 million of operating losses in certain jurisdictions may be carried forward indefinitely. Additionally, as of February 29, 2020, federal capital losses totaling $173.2 million are being carried forward and will expire in fiscal 2022.\nWe have recognized valuation allowances for operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, and other deferred tax assets when we believe it is more likely than not that these items will not be realized. The decrease in our valuation allowances as of February 29, 2020, primarily relates to the reversal of valuation allowances for capital loss carryforwards in connection with the Wine and Spirits Transaction.\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

These liabilities are recorded as non-current as payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date.\nAs of February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, we had $249.4 million and $224.3 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefit liabilities that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate in the year of resolution.\nWe file U.S. Federal income tax returns and various state, local, and foreign income tax returns. Major tax jurisdictions where we are subject to examination by tax authorities include Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, and the U.S. Various U.S. Federal, state and foreign income tax examinations are currently in progress. It is reasonably possible that the liability associated with our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities will increase or decrease within the next twelve months as a result of these examinations or the expiration of statutes of limitation. As of February 29, 2020, we estimate that unrecognized tax benefit liabilities could change by a range of $1 million to $19 million. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. Federal, state, local, or foreign income tax examinations for fiscal years prior to February 28, 2013.\nWe provide for additional tax expense based on probable outcomes of ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. While it is often difficult to predict the outcome or the timing of resolution of any tax matter, we believe the reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash.\n15.

FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 103\n16. LEASES\nGeneral\nWe primarily lease certain vineyards, office and production facilities, warehouses, production equipment, and vehicles. We assess service arrangements to determine if an asset is explicitly or implicitly specified in the agreement and if we have the right to control the use of the identified asset. We have concluded that certain grape purchasing arrangements associated with the purchase of grape production yielded from a specified block of a vineyard and certain third-party logistics arrangements contain a lease.\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is primarily comprised of the initial amount of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs and lease payments at or before the lease commencement date, less any lease incentives received, and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term. All right-of-use assets are reviewed periodically for impairment. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, our secured incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rates are determined using a portfolio approach based on publicly available information in connection with our unsecured borrowing rates adjusted for items including collateral, currency, and the timing in which lease payments are made. We elected to recognize expenses for leases with a term of 12 months or less on a straight-line basis over the lease term and not to recognize these short-term leases on the balance sheet.\nOur leases have varying terms with remaining lease terms of up to approximately 30 years. Certain of our lease arrangements provide us with the option to extend or to terminate the lease early.\nThe right-of-use asset and lease liability are calculated including options to extend or to terminate the lease when we determine that it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options. In making that determination, we consider various existing economic and market factors, business strategies as well as the nature, length, and terms of the agreement. Based on our evaluation using these factors, we concluded that the exercise of renewal options or early termination options would not be reasonably certain in determining the lease term at commencement for leases we currently have in place. Assumptions made at the commencement date are re-evaluated upon occurrence of certain events such as a lease modification.\nCertain of our contractual arrangements may contain both lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components are distinct elements of a contract that are not related to securing the use of the leased asset, such as raw materials, common area maintenance, and other management costs. We elected to measure the lease liability by combining the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all asset classes.\nCertain of our leases include variable lease payments, including payments that depend on an index or rate, as well as variable payments for items such as raw materials, labor, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other operating expenses associated with leased assets. Certain grape purchasing arrangements include variable payments based on actual tonnage and price of grapes that will vary depending on certain factors, including weather, time of harvest, overall market conditions, and the agricultural practices and location of the vineyard. In addition, certain third-party logistics arrangements include variable payments that vary depending on throughput. Such variable lease payments are excluded from the calculation of the right-of-use asset and are recognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred.\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nPurchase commitments and contingencies\nWe have entered into various long-term contracts in the normal course of business for the purchase of (i) certain inventory components, (ii) property, plant, and equipment and related contractor and manufacturing services, (iii) processing and warehousing services, (iv) transportation services, and (v) certain energy requirements. As of February 29, 2020, the estimated aggregate minimum purchase commitments under these contracts are as follows:\nType\nLength of Commitment\nAmount\n(in millions)\nRaw materials and supplies (1)\nPackaging, grapes, hops, malts, and other raw materials\nthrough December 2037\n$\n4,789.5\nIn-process inventories\nBulk wine and spirits\nthrough April 2025\n85.8\nContract services\nProcessing and warehousing services, transportation services, and energy contracts\nthrough December 2030\n657.2\nCapital expenditures (2)\nProperty, plant, and equipment and contractor and manufacturing services\nthrough April 2022\n459.6\nOther\nFinished wine case goods\nthrough May 2029\n32.6\n$\n6,024.7\n(1)\nCertain grape purchasing arrangements include the purchase of grape production yielded from specified blocks of a vineyard. The actual tonnage and price of grapes that we purchase will vary each year depending on certain factors, including weather, time of harvest, overall market conditions, and the agricultural practices and location of the vineyard. Amounts included herein for the estimated aggregate minimum grape purchase commitments consist of estimates for the purchase of the grapes and the implicit leases of the land. Upon adoption of the new lease guidance on March 1, 2019, certain grape purchasing arrangements classified as leases have not resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet due to their variable nature.\n(2)\nConsists of purchase commitments entered into primarily in connection with the construction of the Mexicali Brewery, and the expansion project for the brewery located in Obregon, Sonora, Mexico (the \u201cObregon Brewery\u201d).\nAdditionally, we have entered into various contractual arrangements with affiliates of Owens-Illinois primarily for the purchase of glass bottles used largely in our imported and craft beer portfolios. Amounts purchased under these arrangements for the years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019, and February 28, 2018, were $166.6 million, $238.8 million, and $316.6 million, respectively.\nIndemnification liabilities\nIn connection with prior divestitures, we have indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise subsequent to the divestiture. As of February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, these liabilities consist primarily of indemnifications related to certain income tax matters. During the year ended February 28, 2019, in connection with the sale of the Accolade Wine Investment, we were released from certain guarantees and we recognized a gain of $3.7 million as part of the net gain on the sale of this business. This net gain is included in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments. As of February 29, 2020, and February 28, 2019, the carrying amount of our indemnification liabilities was $9.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively, and is included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities. We do not expect to be required to make material payments under the indemnifications and we believe that the likelihood is remote that the indemnifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.\nLegal matters\nIn the course of our business, we are subject to litigation from time to time. Although the amount of any liability with respect to such litigation cannot be determined, in the opinion of management, such\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 107\nliability will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOther\nIn connection with the write-down of certain bulk wine inventory as a result of smoke damage sustained during the Fall 2017 California wildfires, we have recognized total losses of $20.6 million, with $1.5 million recognized for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and $19.1 million recognized for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020 we recovered $8.6 million from our insurance carriers and do not expect to receive any additional reimbursement.\n18. STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nCommon stock\nWe have two classes of common stock with a material number of shares outstanding: Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock. Class B Convertible Common Stock shares are convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis at any time at the option of the holder. Holders of Class B Convertible Common Stock are entitled to ten votes per share. Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and a cash dividend premium. If we pay a cash dividend on Class B Convertible Common Stock, each share of Class A Common Stock will receive an amount at least ten percent greater than the amount of the cash dividend per share paid on Class B Convertible Common Stock. In addition, the Board of Directors may declare and pay a dividend on Class A Common Stock without paying any dividend on Class B Convertible Common Stock. However, our senior credit facility limits the cash dividends that we can pay on our common stock to a fixed amount per quarter but the fixed amount may be exceeded subject to various conditions set forth in the senior credit facility.\nIn addition, we have a class of common stock with an immaterial number of shares outstanding: Class 1 Common Stock. Shares of Class 1 Common Stock generally have no voting rights. Class 1 Common Stock shares are convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis at any time at the option of the holder, provided that the holder immediately sells the Class A Common Stock acquired upon conversion. Because shares of Class 1 Common Stock are convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock, for each share of Class 1 Common Stock issued, we must reserve one share of Class A Common Stock for issuance upon the conversion of the share of Class 1 Common Stock. Holders of Class 1 Common Stock do not have any preference as to dividends, but may participate in any dividend if and when declared by the Board of Directors. If we pay a cash dividend on Class 1 Common Stock, each share of Class A Common Stock will receive an amount at least ten percent greater than the amount of cash dividend per share paid on Class 1 Common Stock. In addition, the Board of Directors may declare and pay a dividend on Class A Common Stock without paying a dividend on Class 1 Common Stock. The cash dividends declared and paid on Class B Convertible Common Stock and Class 1 Common Stock must always be the same.\nThe number of shares of common stock issued and treasury stock, and associated share activity, are as follows:\nCommon Stock\nTreasury Stock\nClass A\nClass B\nClass 1\nClass A\nClass B\nBalance at February 28, 2017\n257,506,184\n28,358,527\n2,080\n86,262,971\n5,005,800\nShare repurchases\n-\n-\n-\n4,810,061\n-\nConversion of shares\n29,640\n(23,140\n)\n(6,500\n)\n-\n-\nExercise of stock options\n1,182,532\n-\n6,390\n-\n-\nEmployee stock purchases\n-\n-\n-\n(75,023\n)\n-\nGrant of restricted stock awards\n-\n-\n-\n(3,848\n)\n-\nVesting of restricted stock units (1)\n-\n-\n-\n(181,994\n)\n-\nVesting of performance share units (1)\n-\n-\n-\n(68,928\n)\n-\nBalance at February 28, 2018\n258,718,356\n28,335,387\n1,970\n90,743,239\n5,005,800\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 109\n19. STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION\nWe have two stock-based employee compensation plans (as further discussed below).

The aggregate number of shares of our Class A Common Stock and Class 1 Common Stock available for awards under our Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan is 108,000,000 shares.\nThe exercise price, vesting period, and term of nonqualified stock options granted are established by the committee administering the plan (the \u201cCommittee\u201d). The exercise price of any nonqualified stock option may not be less than the fair market value of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. Nonqualified stock options generally vest and become exercisable over a four-year period from the date of grant and expire as established by the Committee, but not later than ten years after the grant date.\nGrants of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units, and other stock-based awards may contain such vesting periods, terms, conditions, and other requirements as the Committee may establish. Restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards are based on service and generally vest over one to four years from the date of grant. Performance share unit awards are based on service and the satisfaction of certain performance conditions, and vest over a required employee service period, generally from one to three years from the date of grant, which closely matches the performance period. The performance conditions include the achievement of specified financial or operational performance metrics, or market conditions which require the achievement of specified levels of shareholder return relative to other companies as defined in the applicable performance share unit agreement. The actual number of shares to be awarded upon vesting of a performance share unit award will range between 0% and 200% of the target award, based upon the measure of performance as certified by the Committee.\nA summary of stock option activity under our Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan is as follows:\nFor the Years Ended\nFebruary 29, 2020\nFebruary 28, 2019\nFebruary 28, 2018\nNumber\nof\nOptions\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nNumber\nof\nOptions\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nNumber\nof\nOptions\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nOutstanding as of March 1\n5,691,219\n$\n81.87\n7,444,701\n$\n56.33\n8,070,255\n$\n44.31\nGranted\n639,957\n$\n206.76\n540,640\n$\n227.91\n624,121\n$\n172.70\nExercised\n(1,618,484\n)\n$\n41.77\n(2,156,508\n)\n$\n23.55\n(1,188,922\n)\n$\n31.86\nForfeited\n(175,917\n)\n$\n201.44\n(133,250\n)\n$\n187.84\n(59,725\n)\n$\n136.08\nExpired\n(11,357\n)\n$\n224.07\n(4,364\n)\n$\n175.86\n(1,028\n)\n$\n36.13\nOutstanding as of last day of February\n4,525,418\n$\n108.87\n5,691,219\n$\n81.87\n7,444,701\n$\n56.33\nExercisable\n3,330,164\n$\n75.61\n4,456,486\n$\n53.18\n5,983,286\n$\n34.12\nConstellation Brands, Inc.

SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK\nNet sales to our five largest customers represented 32.5%, 32.7%, and 32.5% of our net sales for the years ended February 29, 2020, February 28, 2019, and February 28, 2018, respectively. Net sales to our five largest customers are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues. Net sales to an individual customer which amount to 10% or more of our net sales, and the associated amounts receivable from this customer as a percentage of our accounts receivable, are as follows:\nFor the Years Ended\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\nFebruary 28,\nSouthern Glazer\u2019s Wine and Spirits\nNet sales\n10.5\n%\n12.9\n%\n13.0\n%\nAccounts receivable\n27.2\n%\n30.8\n%\n28.1\n%\nNet sales for the above customer are primarily reported within the Wine and Spirits segment. Our arrangements with certain of our customers may, generally, be terminated by either party with prior notice. The majority of our accounts receivable balance is generated from sales to independent distributors with whom we have a predetermined collection date arranged through electronic funds transfer. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers\u2019 financial position, and management is of the opinion that any risk of significant loss is reduced due to the diversity of our customers and geographic sales area.\n23. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThrough February 28, 2019, our internal management financial reporting consisted of two business divisions: (i) Beer and (ii) Wine and Spirits. Beginning March 1, 2019, as a result of our November 2018 Canopy Investment and a change in our chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) on March 1, 2019, we have changed our internal management financial reporting to consist of three business divisions: (i) Beer, (ii) Wine and Spirits, and (iii) Canopy. Consequently, beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we report our operating results in four segments: (i) Beer, (ii) Wine and Spirits, (iii) Corporate Operations and Other, and (iv) Canopy. The Canopy Equity Method Investment makes up the Canopy segment.\nIn the Beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported beer, craft beer, and alternative beverage alcohol brands. We have an exclusive perpetual brand license to import, market, and sell in the U.S. our Mexican beer portfolio. In the Wine and Spirits segment, we sell a portfolio that includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine brands complemented by certain higher-end spirits brands. Amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate growth and strategy, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations, and information technology, as well as our investments made through our corporate venture capital function. All costs included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are therefore not allocated to the other reportable segments. All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in our CODM\u2019s evaluation of the operating income (loss) performance of the other reportable segments. The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting. Long-lived tangible assets and total asset information by segment is not provided to, or reviewed by, our CODM as it is not used to make strategic decisions, allocate resources, or assess performance.\nIn addition, management excludes items that affect comparability (\u201cComparable Adjustments\u201d) from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these Comparable Adjustments are not reflective of core operations of the segments. Segment operating performance and segment\nConstellation Brands, Inc. FY 2020 Form 10-K\n#WORTHREACHINGFOR I 116\nmanagement compensation are evaluated based upon core segment operating income (loss). As such, the performance measures for incentive compensation purposes for segment management do not include the impact of these Comparable Adjustments.\nWe evaluate segment operating performance based on operating income (loss) of the respective business units. Comparable Adjustments that impacted comparability in our segment operating income (loss) for each period are as follows:\nFor the Years Ended\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\nFebruary 28,\n(in millions)\nCost of product sold\nStrategic business development costs\n$\n(124.5\n)\n$\n(6.0\n)\n$\n-\nNet gain (loss) on undesignated commodity derivative contracts\n(49.0\n)\n1.8\n7.4\nAccelerated depreciation\n(7.6\n)\n(8.9\n)\n-\nFlow through of inventory step-up\n(1.5\n)\n(4.9\n)\n(18.7\n)\nSettlements of undesignated commodity derivative contracts\n11.7\n(8.6\n)\n2.3\nRecovery of (loss on) on inventory write-down\n8.6\n(3.3\n)\n(19.1\n)\nTotal cost of product sold\n(162.3\n)\n(29.9\n)\n(28.1\n)\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nRestructuring and other strategic business development costs\n(25.3\n)\n(17.1\n)\n(14.0\n)\nImpairment of intangible assets\n(11.0\n)\n(108.0\n)\n(86.8\n)\nTransaction, integration, and other acquisition-related costs\n(9.2\n)\n(10.2\n)\n(11.3\n)\nNet gain (loss) on foreign currency derivative contracts associated with acquisition of investment\n-\n(32.6\n)\n-\nDeferred compensation\n-\n(16.3\n)\n-\nLoss on contract termination (1)\n-\n-\n(59.0\n)\nOther gains (losses) (2)\n5.5\n10.1\n10.5\nTotal selling, general, and administrative expenses\n(40.0\n)\n(174.1\n)\n(160.6\n)\nImpairment of assets held for sale\n(449.7\n)\n-\n-\nGain (loss) on sale of business\n74.1\n-\n-\nComparable Adjustments, Operating income (loss)\n$\n(577.9\n)\n$\n(204.0\n)\n$\n(188.7\n)\n(1)\nRepresents a loss incurred in connection with the early termination of a beer glass supply contract with an affiliate of Owens-Illinois.\n(2)\nIncludes the following:\nFor the Years Ended\nFebruary 29,\nFebruary 28,\nFebruary 28,\nIncrease in our ownership interest in Nelson\u2019s Green Brier\n11.8\n-\n-\nRecognition of previously deferred gain upon release of a related guarantee\n6.2\n-\n-\n(Increase) reduction in estimated fair value of a contingent liability associated with a prior period acquisition\n(11.4\n)\n-\n8.1\nSale of certain non-core assets\n(0.3\n)\n8.5\n-\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described for the Company in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT\nCOVID-19\nWe have an existing Crisis Management Committee that has been closely monitoring the impact of the novel strain of a virus, COVID-19, on our Company and our workforce since January 2020. In March 2020, the WHO recognized COVID-19 as a pandemic. COVID-19 has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world. In most of our locations, the beverage alcohol industry has been classified as an essential business and as such we are still able to produce and sell our products. COVID-19 has affected us primarily in the reduction of depletion volume on our products in the on-premise business due to shelter in place mandates and bar and restaurant closures. The on-premise business has historically been about 10% to 15% of our depletion volume for beer, wine, and spirits.\nCurrently, our major breweries, wineries, and bottling facilities are still operating but, in some instances, at lower production levels than planned. We have closed all hospitality, tasting rooms, retail, restaurants, and other non-essential public facilities. However, our supply chains and distribution channels have not been materially impacted and we have adequate supply of products to meet forecasted demand. The March 2020 closure of the U.S. and Mexico border to non-essential travel does not impact the movement of commercial products including the products we manufacture in Mexico and import to the U.S.\nWe have implemented various measures to reduce the spread of the virus including working from home, restricting visitors to our production locations, splitting our production workforces, reducing the on-site production workforce levels, screening workers before they enter facilities, implementing social distancing, and encouraging employees to adhere to prevention measures recommended by the CDC and the WHO.
