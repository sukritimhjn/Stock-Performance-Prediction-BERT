    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nSet forth below is a discussion of certain risks affecting our business. The categorization of risks set forth below is meant to help you better understand the risks facing our business and is not intended to limit your consideration of the possible effects of these risks to the listed categories.Any adverse effects arising from the realization of any of the risks discussed, including our financial condition and results of operation, may, and likely will, adversely affect many aspects of our business.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the responses thereto and the economic consequences flowing therefrom, may adversely impact our business, income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, ability to service our debt obligations, and our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders.\nWe have faced, and continue to face, challenges resulting from the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The economic consequences of the pandemic, among other things, have adversely affected the ability of some of our residents to pay rent (due to furloughs, layoffs and/or the expiration of, or reduction in, unemployment benefits). If current economic conditions worsen or continue for an extended period, a significant number of residents may be unable to pay rent, and our ability to pay dividends and/or the debt service on our mortgages will be adversely affected. The impact of the pandemic on our properties has and will continue to vary based on, among other things, the markets in which such properties are located and the significant economic drivers in such markets. For example, some of our properties (e.g., Silvana Oaks Apartments-N. Charleston, SC and Crestmont at Thornblade-Greenville, SC.), offer housing near manufacturing and other facilities (e.g., Boeing and BMW, respectively), and reductions in employment at these or other manufacturing or employment centers located close to our properties may make it more difficult for residents that separated from such employers to pay rent. Other properties (e.g., Parkway Grande-San Marcos, TX and Chatham Court and Reflections-Dallas, TX), offer housing for students at nearby colleges or universities; changes to the programs offered at such institutions (i.e., offering on-line classes as opposed to in-person classes) have resulted in reduced rental demand at such properties. The pandemic (i) has limited our ability to raise rents and market our properties, (ii) delayed efforts to implement value add programs and acquire or dispose of properties, (iii) may result in reduced revenues due to rent accommodations offered to current or prospective tenants and (iv) may require us to incur additional real estate operating expenses to maintain our properties and promote the health and safety of our residents. The occurrence or recurrence of any one or more of the foregoing may adversely impact our results of operations and liquidity and capital resource position. Further, the governmental response to the pandemic has resulted in legislation and orders which, among other things, limit (i) our ability to exercise various remedies (including evicting non-paying tenants) with respect to residents that do not pay rent or other charges and (ii) the rents or ancillary fees we charge or collect. The ultimate impact of the pandemic on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\nRisks Related to our Business\nMost of our multi-family properties are located in the Southeast and Texas which makes us susceptible to adverse developments in such markets.\nThe operating performance of our multi-family properties is impacted by the economic, environmental and other conditions of the specific markets in which our properties are concentrated. Properties owned by consolidated joint ventures generated approximately 23%, 20%, 15% and 15% of our 2020 revenues from properties located in Georgia, Texas, Florida and Virginia, respectively, and properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures generated 28%, 13%, 13% and 11% of our 2020 JV Rental Revenues at properties located in Texas, Georgia, South Carolina and Florida, respectively. Accordingly, adverse developments in such markets, including economic developments, pandemics, or natural or man-made disasters, could adversely impact the operations of these properties and therefore our operating results and cash flow. The concentration of our properties in the Southeast United States and Texas exposes us to risks of adverse developments which are greater than the risks of owning properties with a more geographically diverse portfolio.\nRisks involved in conducting real estate activity through joint ventures.\nMost of our multi-family properties are owned through joint ventures with other persons or entities. Joint venture investments involve risks not otherwise present when acquiring real estate directly, including the following:\nTable of Content\n\u2022our joint venture partners may have economic or business interests or objectives which are or become inconsistent with our business interests or objectives, including differing objectives relating to the sale or refinancing of properties held by the joint venture or the timing of the termination or liquidation of the joint venture;\n\u2022the more successful a joint venture project, the more likely that profits or distributions generated above a negotiated threshold will be allocated disproportionately in favor of our joint venture partner at a rate greater than that implied by our partner's equity interest in the venture;\n\u2022several of our joint venture partners have other competing real estate interests in the markets in which our properties are located that could influence such partners to take actions favoring their properties to the detriment of the jointly owned properties;\n\u2022our joint venture partners obtain blanket property casualty and business interruption insurance insuring properties we own jointly and other properties in which we have no ownership interest and as a result, claims or losses with respect to properties owned by our joint venture partners but in which we have no interest could significantly reduce or eliminate the insurance available to properties in which we have an interest;\n\u2022our joint venture partner might become bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise refuse or be unable to meet their obligations to us or the venture (including their obligation to make capital contributions or property distributions when due);\n\u2022we may incur liabilities as a result of action taken by our joint venture partner;\n\u2022our joint venture partner may not perform its property oversight responsibilities;\n\u2022our joint venture partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests, including actions that may make it more difficult to maintain our qualification as a REIT;\n\u2022our joint venture partner might engage in unlawful or fraudulent conduct with respect to our jointly owned properties or other properties in which they have an ownership interest;\n\u2022changes in personnel managing our joint venture partners have resulted in greater difficulty in working with the new personnel;\n\u2022our joint venture partner may trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner's interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction;\n\u2022disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and divert management's attention from operating our business; and\n\u2022disagreements with our joint venture partners with respect to property management (including with respect to whether a property should be sold, refinanced, or improved) could result in an impasse resulting in the inability to operate the property effectively.\nJoint venture partners have acted without our authorization (e.g., a partner modified a mortgage term without our consent). We also have had, and expect to continue to have, disagreements with joint venture partners over various issues including, among others, as to whether, and the extent to which, value add programs should be implemented at a property, whether a mortgage debt on a property should be refinanced and the terms and conditions of such refinancing, and, because our joint venture structure may incentivize our joint venture partner to sell the property sooner than we would otherwise desire, the timing and terms and conditions of property sales.\nWe own 17 multi-family properties with three joint venture partners or their affiliates and may be adversely effected if we are unable to maintain a satisfactory working relationship with any one or more of these joint venture partners.\nJoint ventures that own seven multi-family properties are owned with one joint venture partner or its affiliates, joint ventures that own six multi-family properties are owned with a second joint venture partner or its affiliates and joint ventures that own four multi-family properties are owned with a third joint venture partner or its affiliates. This concentration of ownership of properties with a limited number of joint venture partners exposes us to risks of adverse developments, and in particular, disputes or disagreements with such joint venture partners, which are greater than the risks of owning properties with a more diverse group of joint venture partners.\nTable of Content\nThe failure of third party property management companies to properly manage our properties or obtain sufficient insurance coverage could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe and our joint venture partners rely on property management companies to manage our properties. At December 31, 2020, approximately 25 properties are managed by a management company owned by or affiliated with a joint venture partner. These management companies are responsible for, among other things, leasing and marketing rental units, selecting tenants (including an evaluation of the creditworthiness of tenants), collecting rent, paying operating expenses, maintaining the property and obtaining insurance coverage for the properties they manage. If these property management companies do not perform their duties properly or we or our joint venture partners do not effectively supervise the activities of these managers, the occupancy rates and rental rates at the properties managed by such property managers may decline and the expenses at such properties may increase. At December 31, 2020, one property manager manages ten of our properties, a second property manager manages six of our properties, a third property manager manages six of our properties and seven other property managers manage five or fewer properties. The loss of our property managers, and in particular, the managers that manage multiple properties, could result in a decrease in occupancy rates, rental rates or both or an increase in expenses. Further, property managers are also responsible for obtaining insurance coverage with respect to the properties they manage, which coverage is often obtained pursuant to blanket policies covering many properties in which we have no interest. Losses at properties managed by our property managers but in which we have no interest could reduce significantly the insurance coverage available at our properties managed by these property managers. It may be difficult to terminate a non-performing management company, particularly a management company owned or affiliated with a joint venture because such termination may require the approval of the mortgagee, our joint venture partner or both. If we are unable to terminate an underperforming property manager on a timely basis, our occupancy and rental rates may decrease and our expenses may increase.\nIncreasing real estate taxes, utilities and insurance premiums may negatively impact operating results.\nThe cost of real estate taxes, utilities and insuring our multi-family properties is a significant component of real estate operating expense. These expenses are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which we may be unable to control. For example, our share of the insurance premiums at joint venture properties is determined by our joint venture partner at such properties; further, casualty losses at certain properties have resulted in significant increases in the insurance premiums we pay for insurance coverage at such properties. Real estate taxes may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities and as property tax rates change. Our real estate taxes have increased over time; further, they have fluctuated and may not be comparable year-over-year because of, among other things, (i) the timing difference as to when we accrue real estate taxes and the results of any tax appeals with respect to such accrued taxes and (ii) determinations, over which we have no control, by governmental authorities to increase tax rates, assessments or procedures. If the costs associated with real estate taxes, utilities and insurance premiums should rise, without being offset by a corresponding increase in revenues, our results of operations could be negatively impacted, and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to compete with competitors, many of which have greater financial and other resources than we possess.\nWe compete with many third parties engaged in the ownership and operation of multi-family properties, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private investors, investment and pension funds and other entities. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Larger and more established competitors enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, enhanced operating efficiencies and more extensive networks providing greater and more favorable access to capital, financing and tax credit allocations and more favorable acquisition opportunities.\nOur operating results are significantly influenced by demand for multi-family properties generally, and a decrease in such demand will likely have a greater adverse effect on our revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio.\nOur current portfolio is focused on multi-family properties, and we expect that going forward we will continue to focus on the acquisition, disposition and operation of such properties. As a result, we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry, and a decrease in the demand for multi-family properties would likely have a greater adverse effect on our rental revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio.\nOur value-add activities involve greater risks than more conservative investment strategies.\nIn many cases, we seek to acquire properties at which we believe our investment of additional capital to enhance such properties will result in increased rental rates and higher resale value. These efforts involve greater risks than more conservative investment strategies. The risks related to these value-add activities include risks related to delays in the repositioning or improvement process, higher than expected capital improvement costs, the additional capital needed to execute our value-add program, the possibility that these value-add activities may not result in the anticipated higher rents and occupancy rates and the\nTable of Content\nloss of revenue while these properties or units are undergoing capital improvements. We may also be unable to complete the improvements of these properties and may be forced to hold or sell these properties at a loss. For these and other reasons, we cannot assure you that we will realize growth in the value of our value-add multifamily properties, and as a result, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected.\nIncreased competition and increased affordability of residential homes could limit our ability to retain our tenants or increase or maintain rents.\nOur multi-family properties compete with numerous housing alternatives, including other multi-family and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single and multi-family homes. Our ability to retain tenants and increase or maintain rents or occupancy levels could be adversely affected by the alternative housing in a particular area and, due to declining housing prices, mortgage interest rates and government programs to promote home ownership, the increasing affordability of owner occupied single and multi-family homes.\nOur operating results and assets may be negatively affected if our insurance coverage is insufficient to compensate us for casualty events occurring at our properties.\nOur multi-family properties, including the properties owned by the joint ventures in which we are members, carry all risk property insurance covering the property and improvements thereto for the cost of replacement in the event of a casualty. Though we maintain insurance coverage, such coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses sustained as a result of a casualty because, among other things:\n\u2022the amount of insurance coverage maintained for any property may be insufficient to pay the full replacement cost following a casualty event;\n\u2022 the rent loss coverage under a policy may not extend for the full period of time that a tenant or tenants may be entitled to a rent abatement that is a result of, or that may be required to complete restoration following, a casualty event;\n\u2022certain types of losses, such as those arising from earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and terrorist attacks, may be uninsurable or may not be economically feasible to insure;\n\u2022changes in zoning, building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors may make it impossible or impracticable, to use insurance proceeds to replace damaged or destroyed improvements at a property;\n\u2022insurance coverage is part of blanket insurance policies in which losses on properties in which we have no ownership interest could reduce significantly or eliminate the coverage available on our properties; and\n\u2022the deductibles applicable to one or more buildings at a property may be greater than the losses sustained at such buildings.\nIf our insurance coverage is insufficient to cover losses sustained as a result of one or more casualty events, our operating results and the value of our portfolio will be adversely affected.\nDevelopment, redevelopment and construction risks could affect our operating results.\nWe may continue to develop and redevelop multi-family properties. These activities may be exposed to the following risks:\n\u2022we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions or increases in construction or financing costs, and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in exploring those opportunities\n\u2022occupancy rates and rents at development properties may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons, including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development by competitors of competing properties\u037e\n\u2022we may be unable to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, occupancy, or other required governmental or third party permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of development opportunities\u037e\n\u2022we may incur costs that exceed our original estimates due to increased material, labor or other costs\u037e\n\u2022we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a development project on schedule, resulting in increased construction and financing costs and a decrease in expected rental revenues\u037e\nTable of Content\n\u2022we may be unable to obtain financing with favorable terms, or at all, for the proposed development of a property, which may cause us to delay or abandon a development opportunity; and\n\u2022we may be unable to refinance with favorable terms, or at all, any construction or other financing obtained for a development property, which may cause us to sell the property on less favorable terms or surrender the property to the lender.\nIf we are unable to address effectively these and other risks associated with development projects, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely effected.\nRisks Related to Our Financing Activities, Indebtedness and Capital Resources\nIf we are unable to refinance $177.0 million in balloon payments on mortgage debt maturing through 2023, we may be forced to sell properties on disadvantageous terms.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have balloon payments of $177.0 million on mortgage debt (including $102.4 million of mortgage debt on properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures) due through 2023 (including $14.0 million, $127.7 and $35.3 million due in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively). The weighted average interest rate of this debt is 3.87%. Our operating cash flow and funds available under our credit facility will be insufficient to discharge this debt when due. Accordingly, we may seek to refinance this debt or sell the related property prior to the maturity of such debt. Increases in interest rates, or reduced access to credit markets due, among other things, to more stringent lending requirements or our high level of leverage, may make it difficult for us to refinance this mortgage debt on terms as favorable as the current debt. If we are unsuccessful in refinancing such debt, or if the terms of the refinanced debt are less favorable that the current debt, we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms or convey properties secured by such mortgages to the mortgagees, which would reduce our income and impair the value of our portfolio.\nThe expiration of our $10 million credit facility in April 2021 will adversely affect our liquidity\nWe depend on our $10 million credit facility to provide us with liquidity, among other things, to fund acquisitions and working capital needs. Our facility matures April 18, 2021. Though we are negotiating an extension to this facility, if we are unsuccessful in such regard, our ability to acquire additional properties and address our working capital and other cash requirements will be adversely affected.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to make required or desired capital improvements.\nOur multi-family properties face competition from newer and updated properties. At December 31, 2020 the weighted average age (based on the number of units) of our multi-family properties is approximately 18 years. To remain competitive and increase occupancy at these properties and/or make them attractive to potential tenants or purchasers, we may have to make significant capital improvements and/or incur deferred maintenance costs with respect to these properties. At December 31, 2020, we have $8.8 million of restricted cash that can only be used for improvements at specific properties. The cost of future improvements and deferred maintenance is uncertain and the amounts earmarked for specific properties may be insufficient to effectuate needed improvements. Our results of operations and financial conditions may be adversely affected if we are required to expend significant funds (other than funds earmarked for such purposes) to repair or improve our properties.\nOur acquisition, development and value-add activities are limited by the funds available to us.\nOur ability to acquire additional multi-family properties, develop new properties and improve the properties in our portfolio is limited by the funds available to us and our ability to obtain, on acceptable terms, equity contributions from joint venture partners and mortgage debt from lenders. At December 31, 2020, we had $19.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $8.8 million designated as restricted cash for improvements at 18 multi-family properties. Our multi-family acquisition and value-add activities are constrained by funds available to us which will limit growth in our revenues and operating results.\nIf we are required to make payments under any \u201cbad boy\u201d carve out guarantees that we have provided in connection with certain mortgages and related loans, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nIn obtaining certain non-recourse loans, we have provided our lenders with standard carve out guarantees. These guarantees are only applicable if and when the borrower directly, or indirectly through an agreement with an affiliate, joint venture partner or other third party, voluntarily files a bankruptcy or similar liquidation or reorganization action or takes other actions that are fraudulent or improper (commonly referred to as \u201cbad boy\u201d guarantees). Although we believe that \u201cbad boy\u201d carve out guarantees are not guarantees of payment in the event of foreclosure or other actions of the foreclosing lender that are beyond the borrower\u2019s control, some lenders in the real estate industry have recently sought to make claims for payment under such guarantees. In the event such a claim were made against us under a \u201cbad boy\u201d carve out guarantee, following foreclosure\nTable of Content\non mortgages or related loans, and such claim were successful, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe could be negatively impacted by changes in our relationship with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, changes in the condition of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and by changes in government support for multi-family housing.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been a major source of financing for multi-family real estate in the United States and we have used loan programs sponsored by these agencies to finance most of our acquisitions of multi-family properties. There have been ongoing discussion by the government and other interested parties with regard to the long term structure and viability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which could result in adjustments to guidelines for their loan products. Should these agencies have their mandates changed or reduced, lose key personnel, be disbanded or reorganized by the government or otherwise discontinue providing liquidity for the multi-family sector, our ability to obtain financing through loan programs sponsored by the agencies could be negatively impacted. In addition, changes in our relationships with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the lenders that participate in these loan programs, with respect to our existing mortgage financing could impact our ability to obtain comparable financing for new acquisitions or refinancing for our existing multi-family real estate investments. Should our access to financing provided through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan programs be reduced or impaired, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and/or increase borrowing costs and could significantly limit our ability to acquire properties on acceptable terms and reduce the values to be realized upon property sales.\nThe phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect our cash flow and financial results.\nAt December 31, 2020, we have (i) $37.4 million in principal amount of junior subordinated notes with an interest rate which resets quarterly and is based on three-month LIBOR plus 200 basis points and (ii) $74.0 million of variable rate mortgage debt (including $73.0 million, of which $47.4 million is construction financing, at our unconsolidated joint ventures) which resets monthly and is generally based on one-month LIBOR rate plus a negotiated spread (collectively, the \u201cLIBOR Debt\u201d). Our exposure to fluctuating interest payments on the junior subordinated notes is unhedged and $26.6 million of variable rate mortgage debt is hedged by two interest rate swaps. The swaps effectively fix our interest payments under the related debt. At December 31, 2020, we have two interest swaps (one at a consolidated joint venture and the other at an unconsolidated joint venture) with separate counterparties in aggregate notional amount of $ 26.6 million. The authority regulating LIBOR announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after June 2023 and it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable at an earlier date. Approximately $37.4 million of the LIBOR Debt matures after 2023. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to how the interest rate on the LIBOR Debt and the related swaps, if any, will be determined when LIBOR is unavailable. Though the LIBOR Debt and, as applicable, the related swaps, provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate if LIBOR is unavailable, such alternative rates may be unavailable (or the alternative rate provide for in the LIBOR Debt may be inconsistent with the alternative rate provided for by the related swap, if any), in which case we may have to negotiate an alternative rate with the counterparties to the LIBOR Debt and, as applicable, the related swaps - we can provide no assurance that we and our counterparties will be able to agree to alternative rates. Even if alternative rates are available, the swaps may not effectively hedge our interest payment obligation under the variable rate mortgage debt and may result in fluctuating interest payments. Our cash flow and financial results may be adversely affected if we are unable to arrange a mutually satisfactory alternative rate to LIBOR for our LIBOR Debt. Further, the absence of LIBOR or a generally acceptable alternative thereto may make it more challenging to hedge our interest rate exposure on variable rate debt that we may incur in the future which in turn may make it more difficult to acquire properties.\nWe depend on our subsidiaries for cash flow and will be adversely impacted if these subsidiaries are prohibited from distributing cash to us.\nWe conduct, and intend to conduct, all our business operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our only source of cash to fund our operations and pay our obligations are distributions from our subsidiaries. We cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us that will enable us to fund our operations. Each of our subsidiaries is or will be a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions, limit our ability to obtain cash from such entities. In addition, because we operate through our subsidiaries, your claims as stockholders will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and those of our subsidiaries will be able to satisfy your claims as stockholders only after all our and our subsidiaries' liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.\nRegulatory and Tax Risks\nChanges to the U.S. federal income tax laws could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nAt any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. We cannot predict when or if any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, or any\nTable of Content\namendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. We and our stockholders could be adversely affected by any such change in the U.S. federal income tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations.\nLiabilities relating to environmental matters may impact the value of our properties.\nWe may be subject to environmental liabilities arising from the ownership of properties. Under various federal, state and local laws, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal of certain hazardous substances released on its property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances.\nThe presence of hazardous substances on our properties may adversely affect our ability to finance or sell the property and we may incur substantial remediation costs. The discovery of material environmental liabilities attached to such properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCompliance or failure to comply with the ADA or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.\nThe ADA generally requires that public buildings, including the public areas at our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. Non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or the award of damages to private litigants. From time-to-time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the ADA. If, under the ADA, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected if we or any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d).\nWe conduct our operations so that neither we, nor any of our subsidiaries is required to register as investment companies under the 1940 Act. If we or any of our subsidiaries is required to register as an investment company but fail to do so, the unregistered entity would be prohibited from engaging in certain business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against such entity. In addition, the contracts of such entity would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of the entity and liquidate its business.\nRisks Associated with the Real Estate Industry and REITs.\nWe face numerous risks associated with the real estate industry that could adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs.\nAs a real estate company, we are subject to various changes in real estate conditions, and any negative trends in such real estate conditions may adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs. These conditions include:\n\u2022changes in national, regional and local economic conditions, which may be negatively impacted by concerns about inflation, deflation, government deficits, unemployment rates and decreased consumer confidence particularly in markets in which we have a high concentration of properties;\n\u2022increases in interest rates, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing or to buy or sell properties on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022the inability of tenants to pay rent;\n\u2022the existence and quality of the competition, such as the attractiveness of our properties as compared to our competitors' properties based on considerations such as convenience of location, rental rates, amenities and safety record;\n\u2022increased operating costs, including increased real property taxes, maintenance, insurance and utility costs (including increased prices for fossil fuels);\nTable of Content\n\u2022weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather-related expenses;\n\u2022oversupply of apartments or single-family housing or a reduction in demand for real estate in the markets in which our properties are located;\n\u2022a favorable interest rate environment that may result in a significant number of residents or potential residents of our multi-family properties deciding to purchase homes instead of renting;\n\u2022changes in, or increased costs of compliance with, laws and/or governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes; and\n\u2022rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs.\nMoreover, other factors may adversely affect our results of operations, including potential liability under environmental and other laws and other unforeseen events, many of which are discussed elsewhere in the following risk factors. Any or all of these factors could materially adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs.\nCompliance with REIT requirements may hinder our ability to maximize profits.\nWe must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our common stock, to qualify as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes. We may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. Accordingly, compliance with REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits.\nTo qualify as a REIT, we must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets. The remainder of our investment in securities cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of such issuer. In addition, no more than 5% of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer, other than a qualified REIT security. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we must dispose of the portion of our assets in excess of such amounts within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our REIT status and suffering adverse tax consequences. This requirement could cause us to dispose of assets for consideration of less than their true value and could lead to a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause real estate investments are illiquid, we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio on a timely basis.\nReal estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions. Further, even if we are able to sell properties, we may be unable to reinvest the proceeds of such sales in opportunities that are as favorable as the properties sold. Our inability to reconfigure our portfolio to profitably reinvest the proceeds of property sales promptly could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur impairment charges in 2021.\nWe evaluate on a quarterly basis our real estate portfolio for indicators of impairment. Impairment charges reflect management's judgment of the probability and severity of the decline in the value of real estate assets we own. These charges and provisions may be required in the future as a result of factors beyond our control, including, among other things, changes in the economic environment and market conditions affecting the value of real property assets or natural or man-made disasters. In 2020, we incurred a $3.6 million impairment charge related to the proposed sale of our Daytona land parcel. If we are required to take additional impairment charges, our results of operations will be adversely impacted.\nIf we do not continue to pay cash dividends, the price of our common stock may decline.\nREIT's are generally required to distribute annually at least 90% of their ordinary taxable income to maintain our REIT status under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, which we refer to as the Code. Because we continue to generate operating losses primarily due to the impact of depreciation, we are not currently required, and may not be required in the future, to pay dividends to maintain our REIT status. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will pay dividends in the future. If we do not continue to pay cash dividends, the price of our common stock may decline.\nTable of Content\nRisks Related to BRT's Organization, Structure and Ownership of its Stock\nOur transactions with affiliated entities involve conflicts of interest.\nEntities affiliated with us and with certain of our executive officers provide services to us and on our behalf. These transactions may not be on terms as favorable as those that we would receive if the transactions were entered into with unaffiliated entities and persons. Among other things, we retain certain executive officers and others to provide the Services. The aggregate fees to be paid for the Services in 2021, and paid in 2020 and 2019, are $1.4 million, $1.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively. We obtain certain executive, administrative, legal, accounting and clerical personnel and the use of certain facilities pursuant to the shared services agreement. During 2020 and 2019, we reimbursed Gould Investors $761,000 and $575,000, respectively, for the personnel and facilities provided pursuant to the shared services agreement. We also obtain certain insurance in conjunction with Gould Investors and reimbursed Gould Investors $39,000 and $40,000, in 2020 and 2019, respectively, for our share of the insurance cost.\nSenior management and other key personnel are critical to our business and our future success may depend on our ability to retain them.\nWe depend on the services of Jeffrey A. Gould, our president and chief executive officer, and other members of senior management to carry out our business and investment strategies. Although Jeffrey A. Gould devotes substantially all of his business time to our affairs, he devotes a limited amount of his business time to entities affiliated with us. In addition to Jeffrey A. Gould, only three other senior executive officers, Mitchell Gould, our executive vice president, Ryan Baltimore, senior vice president-corporate strategy and finance, and George Zweier, vice president and chief financial officer, devote all or substantially all of their business time to us. Many of our executives (i) also provide the Services (see \"Item 1. Business-Human Capital Resources\") and (ii) provide their services on a part-time basis pursuant to the shared services agreement. We rely on part-time executive officers to provide certain services to us, including legal and certain accounting services, since we do not employ full-time executive officers to handle all of these services. If the shared services agreement is terminated or the executives performing Services are unwilling to continue to do so, we will have to obtain such services from other sources or hire employees to perform them. We may not be able to replace these services or hire such employees in a timely manner or on terms, including cost and level of expertise, that are equivalent to or better than those we receive pursuant to the Services and the shared services agreement.\nIn addition, in the future we may need to attract and retain qualified senior management and other key personnel, both on a full-time and part-time basis. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could impair our ability to carry out our business and our investment strategies.\nWe do not carry key man life insurance on members of our senior management.\nCertain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation, our Bylaws and Maryland law may inhibit a change in control that stockholders consider favorable and could also limit the market price of our common stock\nCertain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation (the \"Charter\"), our Bylaws and Maryland law may impede, or prevent, a third party from acquiring control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions:\n\u2022provide for a staggered board of directors consisting of three classes, with one class of directors being elected each year and each class being elected for three-year terms and until their successors are duly elected and qualify;\n\u2022impose restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock (such provisions being intended to, among other purposes, facilitate our compliance with certain requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), relating to our qualification as a REIT under the Code);\n\u2022prevent our stockholders from amending the Bylaws;\n\u2022limit who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022establish advance notice and informational requirements and time limitations on any director nomination or proposal that a stockholder wishes to make at a meeting of stockholders;\nTable of Content\n\u2022provide that directors may be removed only for cause and only by the vote of at least two-thirds of all votes generally entitled to be cast in the election of directors;\n\u2022do not permit cumulative voting in the election of our board of directors, which would otherwise permit holders of less than a majority of outstanding shares to elect one or more directors; and\n\u2022authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to amend the Charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of our stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares.\nCertain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the \u201cMGCL\u201d) may impede a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or inhibit a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could be in the best interest of holders of shares of our common stock, including:\n\u2022\u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions that, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of BRT who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of our then outstanding voting stock) or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter impose two super-majority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations;\n\u2022\u201ccontrol share\u201d provisions that provide that, subject to certain exceptions, holders of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of BRT (defined as voting shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the holder to exercise voting power in the election of directors within one of three increasing ranges) acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding \u201ccontrol shares,\u201d subject to certain exceptions) have no voting rights with respect to the control shares except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares; and\n\u2022additionally, Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL permits our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in the Charter or the Bylaws, to implement certain corporate governance provisions.\nWe have (1) exempted all business combinations between us and any other person, provided that each such business combination is first approved by our board of directors (including a majority of directors who are not affiliates or associates of such other person), from the Maryland Business Combination Act and (2) opted out of the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act.\nOwnership of less than 6.0% of our outstanding shares or less than 6.0% of the aggregate outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock could violate the restrictions on ownership and transfer in our Charter, which would result in the transfer of the shares owned or acquired in violation of such restrictions to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and loss of the right to receive dividends and other distributions on, and the economic benefit of any appreciation of, such shares, and you may not have sufficient information to determine at any particular time whether an acquisition of our shares will result in the loss of the economic benefit of such shares.\nIn order for us to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Code, no more than 50% of the value of the outstanding shares of our stock may be owned, directly or indirectly or through application of certain attribution rules, by five or fewer \u201cindividuals\u201d (as defined in the Code) at any time during the last half of a taxable year. To facilitate our qualification as a REIT under the Code, among other purposes, the Charter generally prohibits any person from actually or constructively owning more than 6.0%, in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding shares of common stock, or more than 6.0% in value of the aggregate outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock, which we refer to as the \u201cownership limits,\u201d unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limit. In addition, the Charter prohibits any person from beneficially or constructively owning shares of our stock that would result in more than 50% of the\nTable of Content\nvalue of the outstanding shares of our stock to be beneficially owned by five or fewer individuals, regardless of whether such ownership is during the last half of any taxable year, which we refer to as the \u201cFive or Fewer Limit.\u201d Shares owned or acquired in violation of either of these restrictions will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary selected by us. The person that owned or acquired our stock in violation of the restrictions in the Charter will not be entitled to any dividends or distributions paid after the date of the transfer to the trust and, upon a sale of such shares by the trust, will generally be entitled to receive only the lesser of the market value on the date of the event that resulted in the transfer to the trust or the net proceeds of the sale by the trust to a person who could own the shares without violating the ownership limits.\nOur board of directors has exempted Gould Investors, Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould and Jeffrey A. Gould from the ownership limits and has not established a limitation on ownership for such persons. Based on information supplied to us, as of December 31, 2020, Gould Investors owns approximately 17.41% of the outstanding shares of common stock and, by virtue of the applicable attribution rules under the Code, one individual currently beneficially owns 22.3% of outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, the acquisition by each of four other individuals of 6.0% of our outstanding common stock, when combined with the ownership of our common stock of Gould Investors, Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould and Jeffrey A. Gould, generally would not result in a violation of the Five or Fewer Limit.\nHowever, there is no limitation on Gould Investors, Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould, Jeffrey A. Gould acquiring additional shares of our common stock or otherwise increasing their percentage of ownership of our common stock, meaning that the amount of our stock that other persons or entities may acquire without violating the Five or Fewer Limit could be reduced in the future and without notice. To the extent that Gould Investors, Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould and Jeffrey A. Gould, or their affiliates, acquire additional shares or our stock, or any other event occurs (including a repurchase of shares of our stock), that results in an individual beneficially or constructively owning 26.0% or more of the outstanding shares of our stock within the meaning of the Charter, the acquisition by four other individuals of 6.0% or less of our outstanding stock would violate the Five or Fewer Limit and, therefore, could cause the stock acquired by one or more of these other individuals to be transferred to the charitable trust, despite their compliance with the 6.0% ownership limits. If any of the foregoing occurs, compliance with the 6.0% ownership limit will not ensure that your ownership of our stock does not cause a violation of the Five or Fewer Limit or that your shares of our stock are not transferred to the charitable trust.\nGould Investors, Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould and Jeffrey A. Gould will be required by the Exchange Act and regulations promulgated thereunder to report, with certain exceptions, their acquisition of additional shares of our stock within two days of such acquisitions, and all holders of our stock will be required to file reports of their acquisition of beneficial ownership (as defined in the Exchange Act) of more than 5% of our outstanding stock. However, beneficial ownership for purposes of the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act is calculated differently than beneficial ownership for purposes of determining compliance with the Five or Fewer Limit. Further, to the extent that any one or more of Gould Investors, Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould or Jeffrey A. Gould acquires 30% or more of our outstanding stock, ownership of five percent or less of our outstanding stock could still result in a violation of the Five or Fewer Limit and, therefore, cause newly-acquired stock in our company to be transferred to the charitable trust. As a result, you may not have enough information currently available to you at any time to determine the percentage of ownership of our stock that you can acquire without violating the Five or Fewer Limit and losing the economic benefit of the ownership of such newly-acquired shares.\nThe stock market is volatile, and fluctuations in our operating results, removal from various indices and other factors could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe stock market has experienced, and may continue to experience, fluctuations that significantly impact the market prices of securities issued by many companies. Market fluctuations could adversely affect our stock price. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions, such as pandemics, recessions, loss of investor confidence, interest rate changes, government shutdowns, or trade wars, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Moreover, our operating results may fluctuate and vary from period to period due to the risk factors set forth herein.\nAlthough our common stock is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, the volume of trades on any given day has been limited historically, as a result of which stockholders might not have been able to sell or purchase our common stock at the volume, price or time desired. In June 2018, our common stock was added to the Russell 3000\u00ae Index. In the short term this may have favorably impacted the price, trading volume, and liquidity of our common stock, in part, because holders attempting to track the composition of that index may have been required to buy our common stock, which could cause a material increase in the price at which our common stock trades. If our common stock is removed from the Russell 3000\u00ae Index because it does not meet the criteria for continued inclusion in such index, index funds, institutional investors, or other holders attempting to track the composition of that index may be required to sell our common stock, which would adversely impact the price and frequency at which it trades.\nTable of Content\nA material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting was identified and has not been remediated.\nWe are required by law to engage in an ongoing review of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In connection with the preparation and filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, we identified the material weakness, described below, in the internal controls over financial reporting. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe concluded that our internal controls surrounding the supervision and review of management\u2019s analyses over the accounting for consolidated entities were ineffective and that we had consolidated the accounts and operations of most of our joint ventures in a manner inconsistent with Accounting Standards Codification 810 (the \"Consolidation Standard\") . While we have taken action to address this material weakness, we cannot provide any assurance that such measures, or any other measures we take, will be effective, and this material weakness has not been remediated. If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, detect or prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may, among other adverse consequences, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and lead to a decline in our stock price.\nGeneral Business Risks\nBreaches of information technology systems could materially harm our business and reputation.\nWe, our joint venture partners and the property managers managing our properties, collect and retain, through information technology systems, financial, personal and other sensitive information provided by third parties, including tenants, vendors and employees. Such persons also rely on information technology systems for the collection and distribution of funds. Our information technology systems have been breached though none of our properties nor tenants have suffered any damages therefrom. There can be no assurance that we, our joint venture partners or property managers will be able to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information or the unauthorized distribution of funds. Any loss of this information or unauthorized distribution of funds as a result of a breach of information technology systems may result in loss of funds to which we are entitled, legal liability and costs (including damages and penalties), as well as damage to our reputation, that could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nWe are an internally managed real estate investment trust, also known as a REIT, that is focused on the ownership, operation and development of multi-family properties. Generally, these properties are owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in which we contributed 65% to 80% of the equity. At December 31, 2020: (i) eight multi-family properties with an aggregate of 1,880 units and a carrying value of $153.6 million are wholly-owned by us; and (ii) we have ownership interests, through unconsolidated entities, in 31 multi-family properties with an aggregate of 9,162 units, and the carrying value of our net equity investment therein is $169.4 million. These 39 properties are located in 11 states; most of our properties are located in the Southeast United States and Texas.\nThe Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic; 2020 and Recent Developments.\nIn 2020, we focused primarily on responding to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic: ensuring the health and safety of our residents, employees, and the property managers\u2019 employees; working with our residents to facilitate the collectability of rent; maintaining an appropriate balance between rental rates and occupancy levels; and ensuring that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to address the challenges presented by the pandemic. The pandemic did not have a direct material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; however, there were indirect negative effects(e.g., we were conservative in implementing our value add program, raising rents and pursuing acquisitions, all of which, if more aggressively pursued, may have allowed us to generate additional income). If current economic conditions worsen or continue for an extended period, there may be significant direct adverse effects, including reductions in our rental revenue and cash flow and difficultly in satisfying our debt service obligations. The impact of the pandemic on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\nDuring 2020, we:\n\u2022acquired, in early February, through an unconsolidated joint venture, an 80% interest Abbotts Run - Wilmington, North Carolina, a 264 unit multi-family property, for a purchase price of $38.9 million, including mortgage debt of $23.2 million and $37.2 million of equity, of which we contributed $13.7 million;\n\u2022sold a $4.0 million loan, which we refer to as the Newark Loan, a legacy asset. The loan was sold for its principal balance plus interest and fees of $325,000;\n\u2022took a $3.6 million impairment charge related to our entering into a contract to sell our 8.7 acre vacant land parcel in South Daytona Beach, Florida for $4.7 million. This sale, which is scheduled to be completed in mid - 2021, is subject to certain conditions, including the purchaser's satisfaction with its due diligence review and obtaining certain zoning treatment. We can provide no assurance that this transaction will be completed. We anticipate using the $4.4 million of net proceeds from the sale for general working capital purposes. See note 3 to our consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022amended the credit facility to allow for its use for working capital (including dividend payments) and operating expenses and reduced the annual interest rate payable thereon from 5.00% to 4.25%;\n\u2022raised approximately $12.1 million of equity in the first quarter from the sale of 694,298 shares of our common stock;\n\u2022declared cash dividends of an aggregate of $0.88 per share;\n\u2022maintained an average occupancy rate of 92.3%.\nOn February 2, 2021,we entered into an agreement to sell to our joint venture partner our 80% interest in Anatole Apartments - Daytona Beach, Florida for approximately $7.4 million and anticipate the transaction will close, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, in March or April 2021. We estimate that we will recognize a gain on sale of our partnership interest of $2.0 million from such sale. In 2020, equity in loss from unconsolidated joint ventures from this property was $250,000.\nOn March 3, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell Kendall Manor - Houston, Texas to an unrelated third party for approximately $24.5 million and anticipate the transaction will close, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, in April or May 2021. We estimate that we will recognize a gain on the sale of this property of approximately $7.5 million. In 2020, our rental revenues, operating expenses, interest expense and depreciation associated with this property were $2.9 million, $1.9 million, $675,000 and $848,000, respectively.\nTable of Content\nYears Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe term \"same store properties\" refers to seven multi-family properties that were owned for all of 2020 and 2019. The term \"unconsolidated same store properties\" refers to 25 properties that were owned for all of 2020 and 2019, other than the Sola/Bells Properties as they were in lease up.\nRevenues\nThe following table compares our revenues for the years indicated:\nRental and other revenue from real estate properties. The components of the increase include:\n\u2022$1.8 million due to the inclusion, for all of 2020, of the revenues from a multi-family property at which we bought out the interest of our joint venture partner in 2019 and which is now wholly owned by us (the \"2019 Consolidating Acquisition\") - prior thereto, this property was owned by an unconsolidated joint venture; and\n\u2022$929,000 from same store properties, of which approximately $805,000 is due to higher rental rates and the balance is due to the increase in other rental revenues and slightly higher occupancy.\nThe increase was offset by the inclusion, in 2019, of $2.3 million of rental and other revenue from two multi-family properties that were sold in 2019 (the \"2019 Sold Properties\").\nOther income. The decrease is due to reduced interest income resulting from the sale of the Newark Loan on September 30, 2020.\nExpenses\nThe following table compares our expenses for the periods indicated:\nReal estate operating expenses. The components of the increase include:\n\u2022$932,000 from the inclusion, for all of 2020, of the expenses from the property acquired in the 2019 Consolidating Acquisition; and\n\u2022$609,000 from same store properties, due primarily to increased real estate taxes at our Houston TX property, increased insurance premiums upon renewals and general increases in utilities and repairs and maintenance.\nThe increase was offset by the inclusion in 2019 of $1.5 million of expenses related to 2019 Sold Properties.\nTable of Content\nInterest expense. The change is due to:\n\u2022a $592,000 decrease due to the 158 basis point decrease in the average interest rate on our floating rate junior subordinated debt resulting from the decline in the three-month LIBOR rate; and\n\u2022a $477,000 decrease due to the inclusion, in 2019, of interest expense related to the 2019 Sold Properties.\nOffsetting the decrease was a $586,000 increase due to the inclusion, for all of 2020, of the interest expense on the mortgage of the 2019 Consolidating Acquisition.\nGeneral and administrative expense.\nThe increase is due to:\n\u2022an $868,000 increase in professional fees and expenses, of which $712,000 was incurred in connection with the Restatement;\n\u2022a $431,000, increase in compensation costs, including a $332,000 increase in non-cash compensation expense related to the amortization of expense related to restricted stock awards (primarily related to the increase in the number, and higher fair value, of the shares granted in 2020 in comparison to the awards granted in 2015); and\n\u2022increased costs of $170,000 from our shared services agreement due primarily to the increased time spent by our part-time executives addressing the Restatement and the corresponding allocation to us of such related additional costs.\nImpairment charge\nWe recognized this impairment in connection with our proposed sale of a vacant land parcel in Daytona, Florida. See \"-The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic; 2020 and Recent Developments\".\nDepreciation.\nThe increase is due to:\n\u2022a $626,000 increase from the inclusion, for all of 2020, of such expense from the 2019 Consolidated Acquisition; and\n\u2022a $457,000 non-cash adjustment to record additional depreciation. In connection with the Restatement, we increased the asset values on three properties at which we previously bought out our partners' interests which necessitated an increase in depreciation at such properties\nThe increase was offset by a $248,000 decrease due to the sale of the 2019 Sold Properties.\nOther revenue and expense items\nEquity in (loss) earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures.\nThe table below reflects the condensed income statements of our Unconsolidated Properties included in note 7 of our consolidated financial statements. In accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles, each of the line items in the chart below is presented as if these properties are wholly owned by us though, as reflected under \" Item 1. Business - Our Multi -Family Properties\", our equity interests in these properties range from 32% to 90% (dollars in thousands):\nTable of Content\nSet forth below is an explanation of the most significant changes in the components of the income and expense of our unconsolidated joint ventures.\nRental revenue from unconsolidated joint ventures\nThe increase is due primarily to:\n\u2022$5.2 million from the Sola/Bells Properties due primarily to increased occupancy and to a lesser extent, higher rental rates at such properties,\n\u2022$4.2 million due to the inclusion, for all of 2020, of revenues from three properties that were only owned for a portion of 2019 (the \"2019 Unconsolidated Acquisitions\"),\n\u2022$2.8 million due to the inclusion of revenue from a multi-family property purchased in 2020 (the \"2020 Unconsolidated Acquisition\"), and\n\u2022$2.5 million from unconsolidated same store properties primarily due to an increase in average rental rates and to a lesser extent increases in other variable payments (e.g., utility reimbursements, late fees, etc.).\nOffsetting the increase is the inclusion, in 2019, of $3.7 million from our Indianapolis IN. property, which was sold in December 2019 (the \"2019 Unconsolidated Sold Property\") and $2.1 from the 2019 Consolidating Acquisition.\nReal estate operating expenses from unconsolidated joint ventures\nThe increase is due to:\n\u2022$2.3 million from unconsolidated same store properties, primarily due to,\n-an increase of $1.4 million in real estate tax expense, of which approximately (i) $330,000 is due to the inclusion, in 2019, of refunds and tax reductions received on a property from multi - year tax challenges and (ii) the balance is due generally to increased assessed values, and\n-$629,000 of increased insurance expense due to increased premiums,\n\u2022$1.9 million due to the inclusion, for all of 2020, of expenses from the 2019 Unconsolidated Acquisitions that were only owned for a portion of 2019,\n\u2022$1.5 million primarily from the Sola property due to increased operating expenses as occupancy has increased throughout 2020 and increased real estate taxes as the property was fully assessed in 2020, and\n\u2022$1.1 million due to the inclusion of expenses from the 2020 Unconsolidated Acquisition.\nTable of Content\nOffsetting the increase is the inclusion, in 2019, of $2.2 million from the 2019 Unconsolidated Sold Property and $1.1 million from the 2019 Consolidating acquisition.\nInterest expense from unconsolidated joint ventures\nThe decrease is due primarily to:\n\u2022a $727,000 reduction in such expense at unconsolidated same store properties due to the inclusion, for all of 2020, of the benefits of three mortgage re-financings that occurred in 2019,\n\u2022the inclusion, in 2019, of $662,000 of such expense from the 2019 Unconsolidated Sold Property, and\n\u2022the inclusion, in 2019, of $592,000 of such expense for the 2019 Consolidating Acquisition.\nThe decrease was offset by (i) the inclusion for all of 2020 of $1.0 million of the interest expense of the 2019 Unconsolidated Acquisitions that were only owned for a portion of 2019 and (ii) $834,000 from the 2020 Unconsolidated Acquisition.\nDepreciation from unconsolidated joint ventures\nThe increase is due primarily to:\n\u2022$2.0 million from the Sola/Bells Properties which in 2019 were not being fully depreciated because they had not been fully completed,\n\u2022$1.7 million from the inclusion of such expense from the 2020 Unconsolidated Acquisition, and\n\u2022$720,000 from the inclusion, for all of 2020, of such expense from the 2019 Unconsolidated Acquisitions that were only owned for a portion of 2019.\nOffsetting the increase is (i) $819,000 from unconsolidated same store properties due to a lower level of depreciation as lease intangibles at several properties have been fully depreciated and (ii) the inclusion, in 2019, of $610,000 from the property acquired in the 2019 Consolidating Acquisition and $566,000 from the 2019 Unconsolidated Sold Property.\nGain on sale of real estate from unconsolidated joint ventures. In 2019, a joint venture sold a property in Indianapolis, IN and recognized a gain of $16.9 million on the sale. There was no comparable gain in 2020.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. In 2019, a joint venture incurred a swap termination fee in connection with the refinancing of a variable rate mortgage to a fixed rate mortgage. There was no comparable expense in 2020.\nTable of Content\nFunds from Operations; Adjusted Funds from Operations; Net Operating Income.\nIn view of our multi-family property activities, we disclose funds from operations (\"FFO\") ,adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\") and net operating income (\"NOI\") because we believe that such metrics are a widely recognized and appropriate measure of the performance of a multi-family REIT.\nWe compute FFO in accordance with the \"White Paper on Funds From Operations\" issued by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") and NAREIT's related guidance. FFO is defined in the White Paper as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities where the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. In computing FFO, we do not add back to net income the amortization of costs in connection with our financing activities or depreciation of non-real estate assets.\nWe compute AFFO by adjusting FFO for loss on extinguishment of debt, our straight-line rent accruals, restricted stock and RSU compensation expense, gain on insurance recovery, and deferred mortgage and debt costs (including our share of our unconsolidated joint ventures). Since the NAREIT White Paper does not provide guidelines for computing AFFO, the computation of AFFO may vary from one REIT to another.\nWe believe that FFO and AFFO are useful and standard supplemental measures of the operating performance for equity REITs and are used frequently by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating equity REITs, many of which present FFO and AFFO when reporting their operating results. FFO and AFFO are intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, which assures that the value of real estate assets diminish predictability over time. In fact, real estate values have historically risen and fallen with market conditions. As a result, we believe that FFO and AFFO provide a performance measure that, when compared year over year, should reflect the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, interest costs and other matters without the inclusion of depreciation and amortization, providing a perspective that may not be necessarily apparent from net income. We also consider FFO and AFFO to be useful to us in evaluating potential property acquisitions.\nFFO and AFFO do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP. FFO and AFFO should not be considered to be an alternative to net income as a reliable measure of our operating performance; nor should FFO and AFFO be considered an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities (as defined by GAAP) as measures of liquidity.\nFFO and AFFO do not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of our cash needs, including principal amortization and capital improvements. FFO and AFFO do not represent cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as defined by GAAP.\nManagement recognizes that there are limitations in the use of FFO and AFFO. In evaluating our performance, management is careful to examine GAAP measures such as net income (loss) and cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. Management also reviews the reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO and AFFO.\nTable of Content\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of net (loss) income determined in accordance with GAAP to FFO and AFFO for each of the indicated years (amounts in thousands):\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of net (loss) income per common share (on a diluted basis) determined in accordance with GAAP to FFO and AFFO.\nTable of Content\nFFO increased in 2020 from 2019 due primarily to a decline in prepayment charges and reduced interest expense due to re-financings and lower interest costs on our junior subordinated debt, improved operating margins at our wholly owned and unconsolidated joint venture properties. The increase was offset by an increase in professional fees related to the Restatement and to a lesser extent, an increase in restricted stock expense.\nAFFO increased in 2020 from 2019 due primarily to improved operating margins and reduced interest expense due to re-financings and lower interest costs on our junior subordinated debt. The increase was offset by the increase in professional fees related to the Restatement.\nNOI is a non-GAAP measure of performance. NOI is used by our management and many investors to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties to other comparable properties, to determine trends at our properties and to determine the estimated fair value of our properties. The usefulness of NOI may be limited in that it does not take into among other things, general and administrative expense, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, casualty losses, insurance recoveries and gains or losses as determined by GAAP. NOI is a property specific performance metric and does not measure our performance as a whole. Same store NOI reflects the operations of seven of our eight wholly owned properties\nWe compute NOI by adjusting net income (loss) to (a) add back (1) depreciation expense, (2) general and administrative expenses, (3) interest expense, (4) loss on extinguishment of debt, (5) equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures, (6) provision for taxes, (7) the impact of non-controlling interests, and (b) deduct (1) other income, (2) gain on sale of real estate, and (3) gain on insurance recoveries related to casualty loss. Other REIT\u2019s may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REIT\u2019s. We believe NOI provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP operating income or net income (loss). NOI is one of the measures we use to evaluate our performance because it (i) measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items unrelated to property operating performance and (ii) captures trends in rental housing and property operating expenses. However, NOI should only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders as computed in accordance with GAAP to NOI for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n(1) Prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the current year composition to reflect only those properties that were same store for both the current and the prior year.\nTable of Content\nNOI increased $397,000, primarily due to $907,000 from the 2019 Consolidating Acquisition and an increase in Same Store NOI of $320,000 offset by a $784,000 decrease due to the sale of the 2019 Sold Properties. The Same Store NOI increase is primarily due to a $929,000 increase in rental revenue from increased rental rates and, to a lesser extent, higher occupancy rates, offset by a $609,000 increase in operating expenses. See \" - Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\"\nDisclosure of Contractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth as of December 31, 2020 our known contractual obligations:\n_________________________\n(1) Reflects payments of principal (including amortization payments) and interest and excludes deferred costs. Includes all of the debt of unconsolidated joint ventures, regardless of the non-controlling interests therein. See the following table for information regarding same. Assumes that the interest rate on the junior subordinated notes will be 2.21% per annum which was the rate in effect at December 31, 2020.\n(2) Assumes that $1.0 million will be paid annually for the next five years pursuant to the shared services agreement and $1.4 million will be paid annually through December 31, 2025 for the Services. See \"Item 1. Business-Our Structure.\"\n(3) Assumes that approximately $5.2 million of property management fees will be paid annually to the property managers of our multi-family properties, including $4.3 million related to unconsolidated joint ventures. Such sum reflects the amount we anticipate paying in 2021 on the multi-family properties we own at December 31, 2020. These fees are typically charges based on a percentage of rental revenues from a property. No amount has been reflected as payable pursuant thereto after five years as such amount is not determinable.\nThe following table sets forth as of December 31, 2020 information regarding the components of our long-term debt obligations:\n___________________________\n(1) Includes payments of principal (including amortization payments), and interest and excludes deferred costs.\n(2) Includes all of the debt of unconsolidated joint ventures, regardless of the non-controlling interests therein.\n(3) Assumes that the interest rate on the junior subordinated notes will be 2.21% per annum.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require funds to pay operating expenses and debt service obligations, acquire properties, make capital improvements, fund capital contributions, pay dividends and to the extent we deem appropriate, repurchase shares pursuant to our share buy back program . In 2020, our primary sources of capital and liquidity were the operations of our multi-family properties (including distributions of $15.3 million from our unconsolidated joint ventures, $12.1 million from the sale of our common stock through our at-the-market equity offering program, borrowings from our $10 million credit facility and our available cash (including restricted cash). At December 31, 2020 and February 28, 2021, our available cash and cash equivalents is approximately $28.7 million and $26.1 million, respectively, excluding any funds held at our unconsolidated joint ventures.\nWe anticipate that through 2023, our operating expenses, $134.5 million of mortgage amortization and interest expense and $177.0 million of balloon payments (including $117.5 million and $102.4 million, respectively, from unconsolidated joint ventures) due with respect to mortgages maturing from 2021 to 2023, estimated cash dividend payments of at least $45.4 million (assuming (i) the current quarterly dividend rate of $0.22 per share and (ii) 17.2 million shares outstanding) and share repurchases, if any, pursuant to our share buy back program, will be funded from cash generated from operations (including distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures), mortgage refinancing, sales of properties, the issuance of additional equity\nTable of Content\nand, if available as noted below, our credit facility. Our operating cash flow and available cash is insufficient to fully fund the $177.0 million of balloon payments, and if we are unable to refinance such debt on acceptable terms, we may need to issue additional equity or dispose of properties, in each case on potentially unfavorable terms.\nWe are negotiating an extension to our $10 million credit facility as the facility matures April 18, 2021. If this facility is not renewed, it will be more difficult to address our working capital needs and complete acquisitions, which would adversely affect us.\nCapital improvements at (i) 18 multi-family properties will be funded by approximately $8.8 million of restricted cash available at December 31, 2020 and (ii) other properties will be funded from the operations of such properties.\nOur ability to acquire additional multi-family properties (including our acquisitions of our partner's interests in properties owned by joint ventures) is limited by our available cash and our ability to (i) draw on our credit facility (ii) obtain, on acceptable terms, equity contributions from joint venture partners and mortgage debt from lenders and (iii) raise capital from the sale of our common stock. Further, if and to the extent we generate ordinary taxable income, we will be required to make distributions to stockholders to maintain our REIT status and as a result, will be limited in our ability to use gains, if any, from property sales, as a source of funds for operating expenses, debt service and property acquisitions.\nCorporate Level Financing Arrangements\nJunior Subordinated Notes\nAs of December 31, 2020 $37.4 million (excluding deferred costs of $317,000) in principal amount of our junior subordinated notes is outstanding. These notes mature in April 2036, contain limited covenants (including covenants prohibiting us from paying dividends or repurchasing capital stock if there is an event of default (as defined therein) on these notes), are redeemable at our option and bear an interest rate, which resets and is payable quarterly, of three-month LIBOR plus 200 basis points. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the interest rate on these notes was 2.21% and 3.94%, respectively.\nCredit Facility\nOur credit facility with VNB New York, LLC, an affiliate of Valley National Bank (collectively, \"VNB\"), as amended and modified, allows us to borrow, subject to compliance with borrowing base requirements and other conditions, up to $10 million. The facility is available for the (i) acquisition of, and investment in, multi-family properties, and (ii) working capital (including dividend payments) and operating expenses, is secured by certain cash accounts maintained by us at VNB, matures April 18, 2021 and bears an annual interest rate, which resets daily, of 50 basis points over the prime rate, with a floor of 4.25%. At December 31, 2020, the annual interest rate on the facility was 4.25%. There is an unused facility fee of 0.25% per annum on the difference between the outstanding loan balance and maximum amount then available under the facility. We are required to maintain substantially all our bank accounts at VNB.\nThe facility includes restrictions and covenants which limit, among other things, the incurrence of liens, and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to, among other things, the minimum amount of debt service coverage with respect to the properties (and amounts drawn on the facility) used in calculating the borrowing base, the minimum number of wholly-owned properties and the minimum number of properties used in calculating the borrowing base. Net proceeds received from the sale, financing or refinancing of wholly owned properties are generally required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under the facility. We are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of the facility.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThough we are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements (as such term is defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K), the following information may be of interest to investors. We are joint venture partners in approximately 29 unconsolidated joint ventures which own multi-family properties. The distributions from the properties owned by these joint ventures ($15.3 million in 2020) are a material source of our liquidity and cash flow. Further, we may be required to make significant capital contributions with respect to these properties. At December 31, 2020, these joint venture properties have a net equity carrying value of $169.5 million and are subject to mortgage debt, which is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, of $835.2 million. Although BRT Apartments Corp. is not the obligor with respect to such mortgage debt, the loss of any of these properties due to mortgage foreclosure or similar proceedings would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. These joint venture arrangements have been, and we anticipate that they will continue to be, material to our liquidity and capital resource position. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\nTable of Content\nSignificant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to understand our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgments and estimates by our management; as a result they are subject to a degree of uncertainty. These significant accounting policies include the following:\nEquity method investments\nWe report our investments in unconsolidated entities, over whose operating and financial policies we have the ability to exercise significant influence but not control, under the equity method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, our pro rata share of the applicable entity's earnings or losses is included in our consolidated statements of operations. We initially record our investments based on either the carrying value for properties contributed or the cash invested.\nWe evaluate our equity-method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investments may exceed the fair value. If it is determined that a decline in the fair value of our investments is not temporary, and if such reduced fair value is below its carrying value, an impairment is recorded. Determining fair value involves significant judgment. Our estimates consider available evidence including the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and other relevant factors. We did not record any impairments related to our equity-method investments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nCarrying Value of Real Estate Portfolio\nWe conduct a quarterly review of each real estate asset owned by us and through our joint ventures. This review is conducted in order to determine if indicators of impairment are present on the real estate.\nIn reviewing the value of the real estate assets owned, whether by us or our joint ventures, if there is an indicator of impairment and the carrying value of the real estate asset is determined to be unrecoverable, we seek to arrive at the fair value of each real estate asset by using one or more valuation techniques, such as comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis or replacement cost analysis. A real estate asset is considered to be unrecoverable when an analysis suggests that the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the property will be insufficient to recover our investment. Any impairment taken with respect to our real estate assets reduces our net income, assets and stockholders' equity to the extent of the amount of the allowance, but it will not affect our cash flow until such time as the property is sold.\nRevenue Recognition\nRental revenue from residential properties is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned. Rental payments are due in advance. Leases on residential properties are generally for terms that do not exceed one year.\nRental revenue from commercial properties, including the base rent that each tenant is required to pay in accordance with the terms of their respective leases, net of any rent concessions and lease incentives, is reported on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the lease.\nPurchase Price Allocations\nWe allocate the purchase price of properties, including acquisition costs and assumed debt, when appropriate, to the tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their relative fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we use a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.\nTable of Content",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nOur junior subordinated notes bear interest at the rate of three-month LIBOR plus 200 basis points. A 100 basis point increase in the rate would result in an increase in interest expense in 2021 of $374,000 and a 100 basis point decrease in the rate would result in a $82,000 decrease in interest expense in 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had one interest rate swap. The fair value of the interest rate swap is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads, which change over time. At December 31, 2020, if there had been an increase of 100 basis points in forward interest rates, the fair market value of the interest rate swap would have increased by $11,000. If there had been a decrease of 100 basis points in forward interest rates, the fair market value of the interest rate swap would decrease by $11,000. These changes would not have any material impact on our net income or cash.",

    "item_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nA review and evaluation was performed by our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that review and evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as designed and implemented as of December 31, 2020, were not effective due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\u201d.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by a company's board, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u2022pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of a company;\n\u2022provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of a company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board of directors of a company; and\n\u2022provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial transactions.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, our management used criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).\nBased on its assessment, it was concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on these criteria. In connection with the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting was identified. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a\nTable of Content\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIn connection with the preparation and filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, we concluded that our internal controls surrounding the supervision and review of management\u2019s analyses over the accounting for consolidated entities were ineffective and that we had consolidated the accounts and operations of many of our joint ventures into our consolidated financial statements in a manner inconsistent with the requirements of the Consolidation Standard.\nAlthough we have taken action to remediate the material weakness, we can only evaluate the effectiveness of such actions when we acquire a property and properly apply the Consolidation Standard to such acquisition. As we have not completed an acquisition since we reported the material weakness in April 2020, we are unable to (i) test the remedial action we have taken and (ii) conclude that our internal controls are effective.\nChanges in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting, as defined in in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2020 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.",

(the Company) as of December 31, 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\nIndex\nJoint Venture Consolidation Assessment\nJoint Venture Consolidation Assessment\nDescription of the matter\nThe Company accounted for certain investments in real estate joint ventures under the equity method of accounting. At December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures were $169.5 million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, for each venture the Company evaluated the rights provided to each party in the venture to assess the consolidation of the venture.\nAuditing management\u2019s joint venture consolidation analyses was complex and highly judgmental due to the subjectivity in assessing which activities most significantly impact the respective joint venture\u2019s economic performance based on the purpose and design of the entity over the duration of its expected life and assessing which party has rights to direct those activities.\nHow we addressed the matter in our audit\nTo test the Company\u2019s consolidation assessment for real estate joint ventures, our procedures included, among others, reviewing joint venture agreements and discussing with management the nature of the rights conveyed to the Company through the joint venture agreements. We reviewed management\u2019s assessment of the activities that would most significantly impact the joint venture\u2019s economic performance and evaluated whether the joint venture agreements provided participating or protective rights to the Company. We also evaluated transactions with the joint ventures for events which would require a reconsideration of previous consolidation conclusions.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2020.\nNew York, New York\nMarch 15, 2021\nIndex\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nStockholders and Board of Directors\nBRT Apartments Corp.\nGreat Neck, New York\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of BRT Apartments Corp. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2019, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nNOTE 1-ORGANIZATION, BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOrganization and Background\nBRT Apartments Corp. (\u201cBRT\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is the successor to BRT Realty Trust pursuant to the conversion of BRT Realty Trust from a Massachusetts business trust to a Maryland corporation on March 18, 2017. BRT owns, operates and develops multi-family properties. Generally, these multi-family properties are owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company contributes a significant portion of the equity. At December 31, 2020, BRT: (i) wholly owns eight multi-family properties located in six states with an aggregate of 1,880 units and a carrying value of $153.6 million; and (ii) has ownership interests, through unconsolidated entities, in 31 multi-family properties located in nine states with an aggregate of 9,162 units , and the carrying value of its net equity investment is $169.4 million. In total, the Company has properties in 11 states, most of which are located in the Southeast United States and Texas.\nThe Company also owns and operates various other real estate assets. At December 31, 2020, the carrying value of the other real estate assets was $6,667,000.\nBRT conducts its operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for Federal income tax purposes.\nSubstantially all of the Company's assets are comprised of multi-family real estate assets generally leased to tenants on a one-year basis. Therefore, the Company aggregates real estate assets for reporting purposes and operates in one reportable segment.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nThe joint venture that owns a property in Yonkers, New York was determined not to be a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") but is consolidated because the Company has controlling rights in such entity.\nThe Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting. For each venture, the Company evaluated the rights provided to each party in the venture to assess the consolidation of the venture. All investments in unconsolidated joint ventures have sufficient equity at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support and, as a group, the holders of the equity at risk have power through voting rights to direct the activities of these ventures. As a result, none of these joint ventures are VIEs. Additionally, the Company does not exercise substantial operating control over these entities, and therefore the entities are not consolidated. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and subsequently adjusted for their share of equity in earnings, cash contributions and distributions. The distributions to each joint venture partner are determined pursuant to the applicable operating agreement and may not be pro-rata to the percentage equity interest each partner has in the applicable venture.\nCertain items on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation including classifying Deposits and escrows within Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\nIncome Tax Status\nThe Company qualifies as a real estate investment trust under sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The board of directors may, at its option, elect to revoke or terminate the Company's election to qualify as a real estate investment trust.\nThe Company will not be subject to federal, and generally state and local taxes on amounts it distributes to stockholders, provided it distributes 90% of its ordinary taxable income and meets other conditions. The Company currently has net operating loss carryforwards which it can use to reduce taxable income.\nIndex\nBRT APARTMENTS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nNOTE 1-ORGANIZATION, BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 740 - \"Income Taxes\", the Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and, as such, does not have any uncertain tax positions that, if successfully challenged, could result in a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. The Company's income tax returns for the previous six years are subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service.\nRevenue Recognition\nRental revenue from multi-family properties is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned. Rental payments are due in advance. Leases on residential properties are generally for terms that do not exceed one year.\nRental revenue from commercial properties, including the base rent that each tenant is required to pay in accordance with the terms of their respective leases, net of any rent concessions and lease incentives, is reported on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the lease.\nReal Estate Properties\nReal estate properties are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, and include properties acquired through acquisition, development or foreclosure.\nThe Company assesses the fair value of real estate acquired (including land, buildings and improvements, and identified intangibles such as acquired in-place leases) and acquired liabilities and allocates the acquisition price, including transaction costs, based on these assessments. Depreciation for multi-family properties is computed on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of 30 years. Intangible assets (and liabilities) are amortized over the remaining life of the related leases at the time of acquisition and is usually less than one year. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.\nReal estate is classified as held for sale when management has determined that the applicable criteria have been met. Real estate assets that are expected to be disposed of are valued at the lower of their carrying amount or their fair value less costs to sell on an individual asset basis. Real estate classified as held for sale is not depreciated.\nThe Company accounts for the sale of real estate when title passes to the buyer, sufficient equity payments have been received, there is no continuing involvement by the Company and there is reasonable assurance that the remaining receivable, if any, will be collected.\nAsset Impairments\nThe Company reviews each real estate asset owned to determine if there are indicators of impairment. If such indicators are present, the Company determines whether the carrying amount of the asset can be recovered. Recognition of impairment is required if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset are less than the asset's carrying amount and that carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. The estimated fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model of the expected future cash flows through the useful life of the property. The analysis includes an estimate of the future cash flows that are expected to result from the real estate investment\u2019s use and eventual disposition. These cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends, the effects of leasing demands, and other factors. In evaluating a property for impairment, various factors are considered, including estimated current and expected operating cash flow from the property during the projected holding period, costs necessary to extend the life or improve the asset, expected capitalization rates, projected stabilized net operating income, selling costs, and the ability to hold and dispose of such real estate in the ordinary course of business. Valuation adjustments may be necessary in the event that effective interest rates, rent-up periods, future economic conditions, and other relevant factors vary significantly from those assumed in valuing the property. If future evaluations result in a decrease in the value of the property below its carrying value, the reduction will be recognized as an impairment charge. The fair values related to the impaired real estate assets are considered to be a level 3 valuation within the fair value hierarchy.\nFor investment in real estate ventures, if indicators of impairment are present, the Company determines if the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. Fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model of the expected future cash flows through the useful life of the asset. The fair values related to the impaired investments in real estate ventures are considered to be a level 3 valuation within the fair value hierarchy.\nIndex\nBRT APARTMENTS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nNOTE 1-ORGANIZATION, BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nEquity Based Compensation\nCompensation expense for grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and dividend equivalent rights are amortized over the vesting period of such awards, based upon the estimated fair value of such award at the grant date. The Company recognizes the effect of forfeitures when they occur and previously recognized compensation expense is reversed in the period the grant or unit is forfeited. The deferred compensation related to the RSUs to be recognized as expense is net of certain performance assumptions which are re-evaluated quarterly. For accounting purposes, the restricted shares and the RSUs are not included in the outstanding shares shown on the consolidated balance sheets until they vest; however, the restricted shares are included in the calculation of both basic and diluted earnings per share as they participate in the earnings of the Company.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nThe Company's objective in using derivative financial instruments is to manage interest rate risk related to variable rate debt. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The Company records all derivatives on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows are considered cash flow hedges. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is reported in other comprehensive income (loss). Those amounts are reclassified to earnings in the same income statement line item that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item when the hedged item affects earnings. For derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized directly in earnings in the period in which they occur.\nPer Share Data\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is determined by dividing net income (loss) applicable to holders of common stock for the applicable year by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during such year. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue shares of common stock were exercised or converted into shares of common stock or resulted in the issuance of shares of common stock that share in the earnings of the Company. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is determined using the treasury stock method by dividing net income (loss) applicable to the holders of common stock for the applicable year by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the dilutive effect of the Company's unvested RSUs.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments; primarily, direct United States treasury obligations with maturities of three months or less when purchased.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash consists of cash held for construction costs and property improvements for specific joint venture properties as may be required by contractual arrangements.\nDeferred Costs\nFees and costs incurred in connection with multi-family property financings are deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt obligations. Fees and costs paid related to the successful negotiation of commercial leases are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nIndex\nBRT APARTMENTS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nNOTE 1-ORGANIZATION, BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nNew Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standard Board issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848). ASU 2020-04 contains practical expedients for reference rate reform related activities that impact debt, lease, derivatives and other contracts. This guidance in ASU 2020-04 is optional and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company has elected to apply hedge accounting expedients related to probability and the assessments of effectiveness for future LIBOR-indexed cash flows to assume that the index upon which future hedged transactions will be based matches the index on the corresponding derivatives. Application of these expedients preserves the presentation of derivatives consistent with past presentation. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance and may apply other elections as applicable as additional changes in the market occur.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which removes, modifies, and adds certain disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements in ASC Topic 820. This guidance is effective for public companies in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This update provides specific guidance for transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees and specifies that Topic 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor\u2019s own operations by issuing share-based payment awards. The amendments also clarify that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (i) financing to the issuer or (ii) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2020. the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d) establishing ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (\u201cASC 326\u201d), as amended by subsequent ASUs on the topic. ASU 2016-13 changes how entities will account for credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The guidance replaces the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d model with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model that requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of the financial asset.

For its unconsolidated joint venture investments, the Company measures and records impairment losses, and reduces the carrying value of the equity investment when indicators of impairment are present and the expected discounted cash flows related to the investment is less than the carrying value.\nIn cases where the Company does not expect to recover its carrying value on properties held for use, the Company reduces its carrying value to fair value, and for properties held for sale, the Company reduces its carrying value to the fair value less costs to sell.\nIn the quarter ended September 30, 2020, indicators of impairment were present on its 8.7 acre vacant land parcel located in South Daytona Beach, Florida. The Company had entered into a contract to sell this property at a sales price less than its carrying value and accordingly, the Company took an impairment charge related to this asset of $3,642,000 representing the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2019, no impairment charges were recorded.\nNOTE 4-REAL ESTATE LOAN\nThe Company had a loan receivable secured by several properties in Newark, NJ. The principle balance of this loan was $4,000,000. This loan was sold on September 30, 2020, to an unrelated third party at its book value plus interest and fees of $325,000.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nNOTE 5-RESTRICTED CASH\nRestricted cash represents funds for specific purposes and therefore are not generally available for general corporate purposes. As reflected on the consolidated balance sheets, restricted cash represents funds held by or on behalf of the Company specifically allocated for capital improvements at multi-family properties.\nNOTE 6 - LEASES\nLessor Accounting\nThe Company owns one commercial rental property which is leased to two tenants under operating leases with current expirations ranging from 2024 to 2028, with options to extend or terminate the leases. Revenues from such leases are reported as rental income, net, and are comprised of (i) lease components, which includes fixed lease payments and (ii) non-lease components which includes reimbursements of property level operating expenses. The Company does not separate non-lease components from the related lease components, as the timing and pattern of transfer are the same, and account for the combined component in accordance with ASC 842.\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, concession agreements were entered into with the Company\u2019s two commercial tenants. In accordance with the FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 842 and 840 - Accounting for Lease Concessions Related to the Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic, a lessor may make an accounting policy election to (i) not evaluate whether such COVID-19 pandemic related rent-relief is a lease modification under ASC 842 and (ii) treat each tenant rent deferral or forgiveness as if it were contemplated as part of the existing lease contract. The Company elected to apply this accounting policy to the two lease agreements, based on the type of concessions provided to the tenants, where the revised cash flows are substantially the same or less than the original lease agreement. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued total abatements of $75,000 for the two tenants.\nLessee Accounting\nThe Company is a lessee under a ground lease in Yonkers, NY which is classified as an operating lease. The ground lease expires September 30, 2024 and provides for one 21-year renewal option. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining lease term, including the renewal option, is 24.75 years.\nThe Company is also a lessee under a corporate office lease in Great Neck, New York, which is classified as an operating lease. The lease expires on December 31, 2031 and provides a 5-year renewal option. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining lease term, including renewal options deemed exercised, is 16 years.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities were $2,652,000 and $2,674,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Company's ROU assets and lease liabilities were $2,822,000 and $2,833,000, respectively and are reported on the consolidated balance sheets in Other assets and Accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively.\nThe discount rate applied to measure each ROU asset and lease liability is based on the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate (\u201cIBR\u201d). The Company considers the general economic environment and its historical borrowing rate activity and factors in various financing and asset specific adjustments to ensure the IBR is appropriate to the intended use of the underlying lease. As the Company did not elect to apply the hindsight practical expedient, lease term assumptions determined under ASC 840 were carried forward and applied in calculating the lease liabilities recorded under ASC 842. The Company\u2019s ground lease offers a renewal option which it assesses against relevant economic factors to determine whether it is reasonably certain of exercising or not exercising the option. Lease payments associated with renewal periods that the Company is reasonably certain will be exercised, if any, are included in the measurement of the corresponding lease liability and ROU asset.\nIndex\nBRT APARTMENTS CORP.

As a REIT, the Company is generally not subject to Federal income taxes at the corporate level if it distributes 100% of its REIT taxable income, as defined, to its stockholders. To maintain its REIT status, the Company must distribute at least 90% of its ordinary taxable income; however, if it does not distribute 100% of its taxable income, it will be taxed on undistributed income. There are a number of organizational and operational requirements the Company must meet to remain a REIT. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, its taxable income will be subject to Federal income tax at regular corporate tax rates and it may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent tax years. Even if it is qualified as a REIT, the Company is subject to certain state and local income taxes and to Federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income.

Net operating losses generated in 2018 and thereafter will be available to offset 80% of taxable income.\nNOTE 10-STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCommon Stock Dividend Distribution\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company declared an aggregate of $0.88 and $0.84 per share in cash dividends, respectively.\nStock Based Compensation\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company's board of directors adopted and the stockholders' approved the 2020 Incentive Plan. This plan permits the Company to grant: (i) stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares awards and any one or more of the foregoing, up to a maximum of 1,000,000 shares; and (ii) cash settled dividend equivalent rights in tandem with the grant of restricted stock units and certain performance based awards.\nEach of the Company's 2018 Incentive Plan (the \"2018 Plan\"), Amended and Restated 2016 Incentive Plan (the \"2016\nPlan\") and the 2012 Incentive Plan (the \"2012 Plan\") authorized the Company to grant: (i) up to 600,000 shares of common stock pursuant to stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance shares awards; and (ii) except for the 2012 Plan which did not authorize such awards, cash settled dividend equivalent rights in tandem with the grant of restricted stock units and certain performance based awards. No further awards may be granted pursuant to the 2018 Plan, the 2016 Plan and the 2012 Plan, which are referred to collectively as the \"Prior Plans.\"\nRestricted Stock Units\nIn June 2016, pursuant to the 2016 Plan, the Company issued restricted stock units (the \"Units\") to acquire up to 450,000 shares of common stock. The Units entitle the recipients, subject to continued service through March 31,2021 (the \u201cPerformance Period\u201d), to receive in the aggregate (i) up to 200,000 shares (the \u201cTSR Award\u201d) of common stock based on achieving, during the Performance Period, specified levels in compounded annual growth rate (\u201cCAGR\u201d) in total stockholder return (\u201cTSR\u201d), and (ii) up to 200,000 shares of common stock based on achieving, during the Performance Period, specified levels in CAGR in adjusted funds from operations, as determined pursuant to the performance agreement (the \"AFFO Award\").\nIn addition, up to 50,000 shares (the \"Adjustment Award\") may be added to or subtracted from the TSR Award, based on attaining or failing to attain, as the case may be, during the Performance Period, of CAGR in TSR relative to the CAGR in TSR\nfor the REITs that comprise, with specified exceptions, the FTSE NAREIT Equity Apartment Index. The recipients also received dividend equivalent rights entitling them to receive cash dividends with respect to the shares of common stock underlying their Units as if the underlying shares were outstanding during the Performance Period, if, when, and to the extent, the related Units vest. The Units were determined not to be participating securities and accordingly, for financial statement purposes, the shares underlying the Units are excluded in the outstanding shares reflected on the consolidated balance sheet and from the calculation of basic earnings per share. Though the 450,000 shares underlying the units are contingently issuable shares, 250,000 of such shares have not been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the criteria with respect to the AFFO Award and the Adjustment Award were not met at December 31, 2020. The Company included 200,000 shares of\nIndex\nBRT APARTMENTS CORP.

For the AFFO Awards, fair value is based on the market value on the date of grant. Expense is not recognized on the Units which the Company does not expect to vest as a result of conditions the Company does not expect to be satisfied. The total amount recorded at the grant date as deferred compensation with respect to the Units was $2,117,000. As of December 31, 2020, $1,432,000 of deferred compensation allocated to the AFFO Award has been reversed, as it is not anticipated that the performance goals will be met. The remaining $685,000 allocated to the TSR Award is being charged to general and administrative expense over the Performance Period. The deferred compensation expense to be recognized is net of certain forfeiture and performance assumptions. The Company recorded $140,000 and $142,000 of compensation expense related to the amortization of unearned compensation with respect to the Units in the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

As of December 31, 2020, an aggregate of 744,145 shares of unvested restricted stock are outstanding pursuant to the Plan and the Prior Plans. All shares of restricted stock vest five years from the date of grant and under specified circumstances, including a change in control, may vest earlier. For financial statement purposes, the restricted stock is not included in the outstanding shares shown on the consolidated balance sheets until they vest, but are included in the basic and diluted earnings per share computation. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $1,681,000 and $1,350,000, respectively, of compensation expense related to the amortization of unearned compensation with respect to the restricted stock awards.

At December 31, 2019, the estimated fair value was lower than the carrying value by $321,000, assuming market interest rates between 3.89% and 4.33%. Market interest rates were determined using current financing transaction information provided by third party institutions.\nConsiderable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value assumptions. The fair values of debt obligations are considered to be Level 2 valuations within the fair value hierarchy.\nIndex\nBRT APARTMENTS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nNOTE 12-FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)\nFinancial Instruments Measured at Fair Value\nThe Company's fair value measurements are based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, there is a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between markets participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions. Level 1 assets/liabilities are valued based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets, Level 2 assets/liabilities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, on quoted prices in less active or inactive markets, or on other \"observable\" market inputs and Level 3 assets/liabilities are valued based significantly on \"unobservable\" market inputs. The Company does not currently own any financial instruments that are classified as Level 3.\nSet forth below is information regarding the Company's financial liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nDerivative financial instruments: Fair values are approximated using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of the derivatives. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, and implied volatilities. At December 31, 2020, this derivative is included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\nAlthough the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivative fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with it utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparty. As of December 31, 2020, the Company assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative position and determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company determined that its derivative valuation is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nLong-lived assets\nThe Company measures its real estate investments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the fair value of the real estate investment was determined using the following input levels (dollars in thousands):\nIndex\nBRT APARTMENTS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nNOTE 12-FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)\nThe Company reviews its investments in real estate when events or circumstances change indicating the carry value of the investment may not be recoverable. In the evaluation of an investment for impairment, many factors are considered, including estimated current and expected cash flows from the asset during the projected hold period, costs necessary to extend the life of the asset, expected capitalization rates, and projected stabilized net operating income and the ability to hold or dispose of the asset in the ordinary course of business.\nQuantitative information about Level 3 measurements is as follows:\nNOTE 13-COMMITMENT AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe Company maintains a non-contributory defined contribution pension plan covering eligible employees and officers.
