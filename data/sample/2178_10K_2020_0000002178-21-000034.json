    "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our common stock involves certain risks. If any of the following key risks were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In any such circumstance and others described below, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisk Related to our Business\nDifficulty in attracting and retaining drivers could negatively affect our operations and limit our growth.\nThere is substantial competition for qualified personnel, particularly drivers, in the trucking industry. We operate in geographic areas where there is currently a shortage of drivers. Regulatory requirements, including electronic logging, and an improving U.S. jobs market, could continue to reduce the number of eligible drivers in our markets. Any shortage of drivers could result in temporary under-utilization of our equipment, difficulty in meeting our customers\u2019 demands and increased compensation levels, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A loss of qualified drivers could lead to an increased frequency in the number of accidents, potential claims exposure and, indirectly, insurance costs.\nDifficulty in attracting qualified drivers could also require us to limit our growth. Our strategy is to grow in part by expanding existing customer relationships into new markets. However, we may have difficulty finding qualified drivers on a timely basis when presented with new customer opportunities, which could result in our inability to accept or service this business or could require us to increase the wages we pay in order to attract drivers. If we are unable to hire qualified drivers to service business opportunities in new markets, we may have to temporarily send drivers from existing terminals to those new markets, causing us to incur significant costs relating to out-of-town driver pay and expenses. In making acquisitions and converting private fleets, some of the drivers in those fleets may not meet our standards, which would require us to find qualified drivers to replace them. If we are unable to find and retain such qualified drivers on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to forego opportunities to expand or maintain our business.\nOur business is dependent on the ability to obtain trade and other credit.\nOur future development and growth depends, in part, on our ability to successfully obtain credit from suppliers and other parties. Trade credit arrangements are relied upon as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flow. If global financial markets and economic conditions disrupt and reduce stability in general, and the solvency of creditors specifically, the availability of funding from credit markets, would be reduced as many lenders and institutional investors would enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt on terms similar to current debt or, in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers. These issues coupled with weak economic conditions would make it more difficult for us, our suppliers and our customers to obtain funding. If we are unable to obtain trade or other forms of credit on reasonable and competitive terms, the ability to continue our marketing businesses, pursue improvements, and continue future growth will be limited. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain future credit arrangements on commercially reasonable terms.\nThe financial soundness of customers could affect our business and operating results.\nConstraints in the financial markets and other macro-economic challenges that might affect the economy of the U.S. and other parts of the world could cause our customers to experience cash flow concerns. As a result, if our customers\u2019 operating and financial performance deteriorates, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers would not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to us. Any inability of current and/or potential customers to pay for services may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face opposition to the operation of our pipeline and facilities from various groups.\nWe may face opposition to the operation of our pipeline and facilities from environmental groups, landowners, tribal groups, local groups and other advocates. Such opposition could take many forms, including organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the operation of our assets and business. In addition, acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism could cause significant damage or injury to people, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our operations. Any such event that interrupts the revenues generated by our operations, or which causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could reduce our cash available for paying distributions to our partners and, accordingly, adversely affect our financial condition and the market price of our securities.\nOur pipeline integrity program as well as compliance with pipeline safety laws and regulations may impose significant costs and liabilities on us.\nIf we were to incur material costs in connection with our pipeline integrity program or pipeline safety laws and regulations, those costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe DOT requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate their pipelines. The majority of the costs to comply with this integrity management rule are associated with pipeline integrity testing and any repairs found to be necessary as a result of such testing. Changes such as advances in pipeline inspection tools and identification of additional threats to a pipeline\u2019s integrity, among other things, can have a significant impact on the costs to perform integrity testing and repairs. We will continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our pipeline. The results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipeline.\nThe rates of our regulated assets are subject to review and possible adjustment by federal and state regulators, which could adversely affect our revenues.\nThe FERC, pursuant to the ICA (as amended), the Energy Policy Act and rules and orders promulgated thereunder, regulates the tariff rates and terms and conditions of service for our interstate common carrier liquids pipeline operations. To be lawful under the ICA, interstate tariff rates, terms and conditions of service must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory, and must be on file with the FERC. In addition, pipelines may not confer any undue preference upon any shipper. Shippers may protest (and the FERC may investigate) the lawfulness of new or changed tariff rates. The FERC can suspend those tariff rates for up to seven months. It can also require refunds of amounts collected pursuant to rates that are ultimately found to be unlawful and prescribe new rates prospectively. The FERC and interested parties can also challenge tariff rates that have become final and effective. The FERC can also order new rates to take effect prospectively and order reparations for past rates that exceed the just and reasonable level up to two years prior to the date of a complaint. Due to the complexity of rate making, the lawfulness of any rate is never assured. A successful challenge of our rates could adversely affect our revenues.\nThe intrastate liquids pipeline transportation services we provide are subject to various state laws and regulations that apply to the rates we charge and the terms and conditions of the services we offer. Although state regulation typically is less onerous than FERC regulation, the rates we charge and the provision of our services may be subject to challenge\nRevenues are generated under contracts that must be renegotiated periodically.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are generated under contracts which expire periodically or which must be frequently renegotiated, extended or replaced. Whether these contracts are renegotiated, extended or replaced is often subject to factors beyond our control. These factors include sudden fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices, counterparty ability to pay for or accept the contracted volumes and, most importantly, an extremely competitive marketplace for the services we offer. We cannot assure you that the costs and pricing of our services can remain competitive in the marketplace or that we will be successful in renegotiating our contracts.\nAnticipated or scheduled volumes will differ from actual or delivered volumes.\nOur crude oil marketing business purchases initial production of crude oil at the wellhead under contracts requiring us to accept the actual volume produced. The resale of this production is generally under contracts requiring a fixed volume to be delivered. We estimate our anticipated supply and match that supply estimate for both volume and pricing formulas with committed sales volumes. Since actual wellhead volumes produced will rarely equal anticipated supply, our marketing margins may be adversely impacted. In many instances, any losses resulting from the difference between actual supply volumes compared to committed sales volumes must be absorbed by us.\nEnvironmental liabilities and environmental regulations may have an adverse effect on us.\nOur business is subject to environmental hazards such as spills, leaks or any discharges of petroleum products and hazardous substances. These environmental hazards could expose us to material liabilities for property damage, personal injuries, and/or environmental harms, including the costs of investigating and rectifying contaminated properties.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations govern many aspects of our business, such as transportation and waste management. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant costs or may require a decrease in business activities. Moreover, noncompliance with these laws and regulations could subject us to significant administrative, civil, and/or criminal fines and/or penalties, as well as potential injunctive relief. See discussion under \u201cItem 1 and 2. Business and Properties - Regulatory Matters,\u201d and in the sections that follow, for additional detail.\nCurrent and future litigation could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe are currently involved in certain administrative and civil legal proceedings as part of the ordinary course of our business. Moreover, as incidental to operations, we sometimes become involved in various lawsuits and/or disputes. Lawsuits and other legal proceedings can involve substantial costs, including the costs associated with investigation, litigation and possible settlement, judgment, penalty or fine. Although we maintain insurance to mitigate these costs, we cannot assure you that costs associated with lawsuits or other legal proceedings will not exceed the limits of insurance policies. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if a judgment, penalty or fine is not fully covered by insurance.\nRisk Related to our Industry\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the recent OPEC price war could disrupt our operations and adversely impact our business and financial results.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in the implementation of significant governmental measures to control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions, business shutdowns and restrictions on non-essential activities in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, the global economy has been marked by significant slowdown and uncertainty, which has led to a precipitous decline in crude oil prices in response to demand concerns, further exacerbated by the OPEC price war during the first quarter of 2020 and global storage considerations. During the second quarter of 2020, while members of OPEC reached agreements to cut crude oil production, downward pressure on crude oil prices continues and could continue into the foreseeable future, due to concerns regarding an oversupply of crude oil inventories. As a result, prices of crude oil and other commodities continue to remain volatile.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused a number of adverse economic effects, including government restrictions, changes in consumer behavior related to the economic slowdown, and disruption of historical supply and demand patterns, which have negatively affected our business and the businesses of our customers.\nAs a result, our crude oil marketing operations have declined, as low crude oil prices have negatively impacted production of crude oil, and demand for crude oil and other related products has significantly decreased. While we consider the lower crude oil prices and decrease in demand to be temporary, if the pandemic and decline in crude oil prices continue, they may have a material adverse on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity in 2021. We are actively monitoring our financial condition, liquidity, operations, customers, industry and workforce. Although we cannot estimate the length or gravity of the impacts of these events at this time, if the pandemic and decline in oil prices continue, we expect that they will have an adverse effect on our results of future operations, financial position and liquidity.\nAdditionally, during the second quarter of 2020, we saw a significant decline in our overall transportation operations primarily due to the continuation of the governmental restrictions and the adverse economic effects. While demand for transportation of products has begun to increase but has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, such demand may decrease again in the future, particularly if governmental restrictions are renewed or reinstituted.\nThe implementation of governmental restrictions related to COVID-19 has not to date had a significant impact on our ability to deploy our workforce effectively, as the transportation industry has been deemed an essential service, but limitations or restrictions could be enacted in the future that would impact our operations. Additionally, we may also experience disruptions in our workforce related to COVID-19, which may negatively affect our revenues in 2021 and our overall liquidity.\nGeneral economic conditions could reduce demand for chemical based trucking services.\nCustomer demand for our products and services is substantially dependent upon the general economic conditions for the U.S., which are cyclical in nature. In particular, demand for liquid chemical truck transportation services is dependent on activity within the petrochemical sector of the U.S. economy. Chemical sector demand typically varies with the housing and auto markets as well as the relative strength of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies. A relatively strong U.S. dollar exchange rate may be adverse to our transportation operation since it tends to suppress export demand for petrochemicals. Conversely, a weak U.S. dollar exchange rate tends to stimulate export demand for petrochemicals.\nFluctuations in crude oil prices could have an adverse effect on us.\nOur future financial condition, revenues, results of operations and future rate of growth are materially affected by crude oil prices that historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Crude oil prices depend on factors outside of our control. These factors include:\n\u2022supply and demand for crude oil and expectations regarding supply and demand;\n\u2022political conditions in other crude oil-producing countries, including the possibility of insurgency or war in such areas;\n\u2022economic conditions in the U.S. and worldwide;\n\u2022the impact of public health epidemics, like the global coronavirus outbreak beginning in 2020;\n\u2022governmental regulations and taxation;\n\u2022the impact of energy conservation efforts;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuel sources;\n\u2022weather conditions;\n\u2022availability of local, interstate and intrastate transportation systems; and\n\u2022market uncertainty.\nPotentially escalating diesel fuel prices could have an adverse effect on us.\nAs an integral part of our crude oil marketing and transportation businesses, we operate approximately 570 tractors, and diesel fuel costs are a significant component of our operating expenses. These costs generally fluctuate with increasing and decreasing world crude oil prices. In our transportation segment, we typically incorporate a fuel surcharge provision in our customer contracts. During periods of high prices, we attempt to recoup rising diesel fuel costs through the pricing of our services; however to the extent these costs escalate, our operating earnings will generally be adversely affected.\nInsurance and claims expenses, including for self-insured risks, could significantly reduce our earnings.\nTransportation of hazardous materials involves certain operating hazards such as automobile accidents, explosions, fires and pollution. Any of these operating hazards could cause serious injuries, fatalities or property damage, which could expose us to liability. The payment of any of these liabilities could reduce, or even eliminate, the funds available for other areas.\nConsistent with the industry standard, our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution, with broader coverage provided for sudden and accidental occurrences. Insurance might be inadequate to cover all liabilities. Obtaining insurance for our line of business can become difficult and costly. Typically, when insurance cost escalates, we may reduce our level of coverage, and more risk may be retained to offset cost increases.\nBeginning in 2021, we self-insure a significant portion of our claims exposure resulting from auto liability, general liability and workers\u2019 compensation through our wholly owned captive insurance company. Although we reserve for anticipated losses and expenses based on actuarial reviews and periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience, estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related costs to settle or resolve them, is inherently difficult, and such costs could exceed our estimates. Accordingly, our actual losses associated with insured claims may differ materially from our estimates and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in material amounts.\nWe maintain an insurance program for potential losses that are in excess of the amounts that we insure through the captive, as well as potential losses from other categories of claims. Although we believe our aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover our historic or future claims amounts, it is possible that one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. If any claim were to exceed our aggregate insurance coverage, we would bear the excess, in addition to the amount in the captive.\nGiven the current claims settlement environment, the amount of commercially available insurance coverage is decreasing, and the premiums for this coverage are increasing significantly. For the foregoing reasons, our insurance and claims expenses may increase, or we could increase our self-insured retention as policies are renewed or replaced. In addition, we may assume additional risk within our captive insurance company that we may or may not reinsure. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if (1) our costs or losses significantly exceed our aggregate self-insurance and excess coverage limits, (2) we are unable to obtain affordable insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, (3) our insurance carriers fail to pay on our insurance claims, or (4) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided.\nCounterparty credit default could have an adverse effect on us.\nOur revenues are generated under contracts with various counterparties, and our results of operations could be adversely affected by non-performance under the various contracts. A counterparty\u2019s default or non-performance could be caused by factors beyond our control. A default could occur as a result of circumstances relating directly to the counterparty, or due to circumstances caused by other market participants having a direct or indirect relationship with the counterparty. We seek to mitigate the risk of default by evaluating the financial strength of potential counterparties; however, despite mitigation efforts, contractual defaults do occur from time to time.\nOur business is subject to changing government regulations.\nFederal, state or local government agencies may impose environmental, labor or other regulations that increase costs and/or terminate or suspend operations. Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations. These regulations relate to, among other things, transportation of crude oil and natural gas. Existing laws and regulations could be changed, and any changes could increase costs of compliance and costs of operations.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (\u201cGHGs\u201d) could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil we market and transport.\nMore stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and GHGs may be adopted and could cause us to incur material expenses to comply with such laws and regulations. In the absence of comprehensive federal legislation on GHG emission control, the EPA attempted to require the permitting of GHG emissions; although the Supreme Court struck down certain of the permitting requirements in 2014, it upheld the EPA\u2019s authority to control GHG emissions when a permit is required due to emissions of other pollutants. The EPA also requires the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources including onshore and offshore crude oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore crude oil and natural gas processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. Reporting of GHG emissions from such large facilities is required on an annual basis. We do not presently operate any such large GHG emission sources but, if we were to do so in the future, we would incur costs associated with evaluating and meeting this reporting obligation.\nRegulation of methane emissions has varied significantly between recent administrations, and may continue to change under the current administration or in the future. In May 2016, the EPA finalized rules to reduce methane emissions from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the crude oil and natural gas sector. However, in August 2020, the EPA adopted significant revisions to the 2016 rules. Regarding existing sources in the crude oil and natural gas section, the EPA announced in March 2016 that it intended to develop rules to reduce methane emissions for existing sources, although the EPA later announced in March 2017 that it no longer intends to pursue regulation of methane emissions from existing sources. In November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) issued final rules to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring and leaks during crude oil and natural gas operations on public lands, which the BLM later revised in rules promulgated in September 2018. Several states are pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of methane from new and existing sources within the crude oil and natural gas source category.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and many states and regions have already taken legal measures to reduce or measure GHG emission levels, often involving the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to reduce overall GHG emissions, and the cost of these allowances could escalate significantly over time. In the markets in which we currently operate, our operations are not affected by such GHG cap and trade programs. On an international level, almost 200 nations agreed in December 2015 to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and to be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. Although the U.S. withdrew from the Paris accord in November 2020, it rejoined under the new administration in February 2021. Further, several states and local governments remain committed to the principles of the international climate agreement in their effectuation of policy and regulations. It is not possible at this time to predict how or when the U.S. might impose restrictions on GHGs as a result of the international climate change agreement. The adoption and implementation of any legislation or regulatory programs imposing GHG reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations including costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our GHG emissions, pay any taxes related to GHG emissions and administer and manage a GHG emissions program. Such programs also could adversely affect demand for the crude oil that we market and transport.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEconomic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.\nPotential disruptions in the credit markets and concerns about global economic growth could have a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. These factors could contribute to a decline in our stock price and corresponding market capitalization. If commodity prices experience a period of rapid decline, or a prolonged period of low commodity prices, our future earnings will be reduced. We currently do not have bank debt obligations. If the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds become limited, our customers and suppliers may incur increased costs associated with issuing commercial paper and/or other debt instruments and this, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to secure supply and make profitable sales.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or regulations.\nThe Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Treasury Department, Congress and the states frequently review federal or state income tax legislation. We cannot predict whether, when, or to what extent new federal or state tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any such legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us.\nWe are subject to risks associated with climate change.\nIn interpretative guidance on climate change disclosures, the SEC indicates that climate change could have an effect on the severity of weather (including hurricanes and floods), sea levels, the arability of farmland and water availability and quality. If such effects were to occur, our operations have the potential to be adversely affected. Potential adverse effects could include disruption of our marketing and transportation activities, including, for example, damages to our facilities from powerful winds or floods, or increases in our costs of operation or reductions in the efficiency of our operations, as well as potentially increased costs for insurance coverages in the aftermath of such effects. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process related services provided by companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. In addition, the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which we operate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change.\nCyber-attacks or other disruptions to our information technology systems could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, fines or harm to our competitive position.\nWe rely on our information technology systems to conduct our business, including systems of third-party vendors. These systems include information used to operate our assets and cloud-based services. These systems have been subject to attempted security breaches and cyber-attacks in the past, and may be subject to such attacks in the future.\nWe may incur increasing costs in connection with our efforts to enhance and ensure security and in response to actual or attempted cybersecurity attacks. Substantial aspects of our business depend on the secure operation of our computer systems and websites. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss, misuse or interruption of sensitive and critical information and functions, including our own proprietary information and that of our customers, suppliers and employees. Such breaches could result in operational impacts, reputational harm, competitive disadvantage, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions and liability. While we devote substantial resources to maintaining adequate levels of cybersecurity, we cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent all of the rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs for technology, personnel and services to enhance security or to respond to occurrences.\nWe have programs, processes and technologies in place to attempt to prevent, detect, contain, respond to and mitigate security-related threats and potential incidents. We undertake ongoing improvements to our systems, connected devices and information-sharing products in order to minimize vulnerabilities, in accordance with industry and regulatory standards; however, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and can be difficult to detect. Anticipating, identifying or preventing these intrusions or mitigating them if and when they occur is challenging and makes us more vulnerable to cyberattacks than other companies not similarly situated.\nIf our security measures are circumvented, proprietary information may be misappropriated, our operations may be disrupted, and our computers or those of our customers or other third parties may be damaged. Compromises of our security may result in an interruption of operations, violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures.",

We are currently unaware of any claims against us that are either outside the scope of insurance coverage or that may exceed the level of insurance coverage and could potentially represent a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nSee Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.",

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) in the U.S.\nOverview of Business\nAdams Resources & Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in crude oil marketing, transportation, terminalling and storage in various crude oil and natural gas basins in the lower 48 states of the U.S. We also conduct tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals, pressurized gases, asphalt and dry bulk primarily in the lower 48 states of the U.S. with deliveries into Canada and Mexico, and with fifteen terminals across the U.S.\nWe operate and report in three business segments: (i) crude oil marketing, transportation and storage; (ii) tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals, pressurized gases, asphalt and dry bulk; and (iii) beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, pipeline transportation, terminalling and storage of crude oil, which includes the pipeline and related terminal facility assets we acquired in October 2020 (see Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this acquisition). See Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our business segments.\nResults of Operations\nCrude Oil Marketing\nOur crude oil marketing segment revenues, operating earnings and selected costs were as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n____________________\n(1)Represents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year.\n(2)Operating earnings included net inventory valuation losses of $15.0 million, inventory liquidation gains of $3.7 million and inventory valuation losses of $5.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nVolume and price information were as follows for the periods indicated:\n____________________\n(1)Reflects the volume purchased from third parties at the field level of operations.\n(2)Effective October 1, 2018, in connection with the Red River acquisition, we entered into a new revenue contract to purchase crude oil.

Crude oil marketing revenues decreased by $797.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily as a result of a decrease in the market price of crude oil, which decreased revenues by approximately $641.2 million, and lower crude oil volumes, which decreased revenues by approximately $156.4 million. The average crude oil price received was $56.28 for 2019, which decreased to $36.90 for 2020. Revenues from legacy volumes are based upon the market price in our other market areas, primarily in the Gulf Coast. The decrease in the market price of crude oil and the lower crude oil volumes produced and available for purchase were due to the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on the economy and the delay of OPEC to agree on crude oil production levels during the second quarter of 2020, both of which resulted in market disruptions that decreased the demand for and price of crude oil.\nOur crude oil marketing operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $13.1 million as compared to 2019, primarily as a result of inventory valuation losses of $15.0 million in 2020 as compared to inventory liquidation gains of $3.7 million in 2019 (as shown in the following table), decreases in crude oil volumes in 2020, and a decrease in the average market price of crude oil.\nDriver compensation decreased by $4.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of drivers required for volumes transported in 2020 as compared to 2019.\nInsurance costs decreased by $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to decreases to reserves for insurance claims resulting from our favorable safety record over the policy period, lower hours worked by drivers and lower miles driven in 2020. Fuel costs decreased by $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 consistent with the lower driver count in the current year and lower miles driven in 2020.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to the timing of purchases and retirements of tractors and other field equipment during 2019 and 2020.\n2019 compared to 2018. Crude oil marketing revenues increased by $53.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily as a result of higher crude oil volumes, which increased revenues by approximately $456.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in the market price of crude oil, which decreased revenues by approximately $402.5 million. The average crude oil price received was $64.53 for 2018, which decreased to $56.28 for 2019. Volumes increased by approximately 28,000 barrels per day during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily as a result of the acquisition of a trucking company that owned approximately 113 tractors and 126 trailers operating in the Red River area in North Texas and South Central Oklahoma (the \u201cRed River acquisition\u201d) on October 1, 2018. The purchase price for Red River volumes is based on a contractual price for volumes in North Texas and Oklahoma, which had been slightly lower than the purchase price for legacy volumes. Revenues from legacy volumes are based upon the market price in our other market areas, primarily in the Gulf Coast.\nOur crude oil marketing operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $9.1 million as compared to 2018, primarily as a result of inventory liquidation gains of $3.7 million in 2019 as compared to inventory valuation losses of $5.4 million in 2018 (as shown in the following table) and increases in crude oil volumes in 2019, partially offset by a decrease in the average market price of crude oil. During 2019, volumes increased as activity in certain marketing areas increased primarily as a result of increased wellhead purchases.\nDriver compensation increased by $8.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily as a result of an increase in the number of drivers in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to the Red River acquisition on October 1, 2018. In connection with the Red River acquisition, we hired over one hundred additional drivers.\nInsurance costs increased by $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to a higher driver count and additional miles driven in 2019, as a result of the Red River acquisition in 2018. Fuel costs increased by $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018 consistent with the higher driver count in 2019 and additional miles driven, primarily as a result of the additional drivers hired for the Red River assets.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $2.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily as a result of the acquisition of the Red River assets, consisting of approximately 113 tractors and 126 trailers on October 1, 2018, which resulted in an increase in depreciation expense. In addition, we purchased 43 new tractors and other field equipment during 2019, and retired 48 tractors.\nField Level Operating Earnings (Non-GAAP Financial Measure). Inventory valuations and forward commodity contract (derivatives or mark-to-market) valuations are two significant factors affecting comparative crude oil marketing segment operating earnings. As a purchaser and shipper of crude oil, we hold inventory in storage tanks and third-party pipelines. During periods of increasing crude oil prices, we recognize inventory liquidation gains while during periods of falling prices, we recognize inventory liquidation and valuation losses.\nCrude oil marketing operating earnings can be affected by the valuations of our forward month commodity contracts (derivative instruments). These non-cash valuations are calculated and recorded at each period end based on the underlying data existing as of such date. We generally enter into these derivative contracts as part of a pricing strategy based on crude oil purchases at the wellhead (field level). The valuation of derivative instruments at period end requires the recognition of non-cash \u201cmark-to-market\u201d gains and losses.\nThe impact of inventory liquidations and derivative valuations on our crude oil marketing segment operating earnings is summarized in the following reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measure for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n____________________\n(1)Segment operating earnings included net inventory valuation losses of $15.0 million, inventory liquidation gains of $3.7 million and inventory valuation losses of $5.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(2)The use of field level operating earnings is unique to us, not a substitute for a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to any similar measures developed by industry participants. We utilize this data to evaluate the profitability of our operations.\nField level operating earnings and field level purchase volumes depict our day-to-day operation of acquiring crude oil at the wellhead, transporting the product and delivering the product to market sales points. Field level operating earnings increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower revenues resulting from lower volumes and a decrease in the market price of crude oil in 2020.\nField level operating earnings during the year ended December 31, 2019 were consistent with the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to higher revenues resulting from higher crude oil volumes in 2019, offset by a decrease in the market price of crude oil in 2019.\nWe held crude oil inventory at a weighted average composite price as follows at the dates indicated (in barrels and price per barrel):\nHistorically, prices received for crude oil have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nTransportation\nOur transportation segment revenues, operating earnings and selected costs were as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n____________________\n(1)Represents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year.\n(2)The increase in mileage from 2019 to 2020 is primarily due to the CTL acquisition, which added services to new and existing customers, new product lines and six new market areas.\nOur revenue rate structure includes a component for fuel costs in which fuel cost fluctuations are largely passed through to the customer over time. Revenues, net of fuel cost, were as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n____________________\n(1)Revenues, net of fuel cost, is a non-GAAP financial measure and is utilized for internal analysis of the results of our transportation segment.\n2020 compared to 2019. Transportation revenues increased by $8.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily as a result of the CTL acquisition in June 2020 and the EH Transport acquisition in May 2019 (see Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by a decrease in customer activity as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak resulting in lower miles traveled in 2020. Revenues, net of fuel cost, increased by $9.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily as a result of the higher transportation revenues and miles traveled during 2020.\nOur transportation operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020 were consistent with the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense related to the CTL acquisition, the EH Transport acquisition and new assets placed into service, and higher insurance and certain other operating expenses, offset by higher revenues and increased miles traveled during 2020.\nFuel costs decreased by $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily as a result of lower fuel prices and fewer miles traveled during the first six months of 2020, partially offset by an increase in the number of miles traveled as a result of the CTL acquisition in June 2020. Insurance costs increased $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to the CTL acquisition which resulted in a higher driver count and increased miles driven in 2020. Maintenance expense increased by $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, as a result of the purchase of new tractors and the retirement of older tractors, as the age of our fleet has decreased.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $3.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily as a result of the CTL acquisition in June 2020, the EH Transport acquisition in May 2019 and the purchase and lease of new tractors and trailers in 2019 and 2020.\n2019 compared to 2018. Transportation revenues increased by $7.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily as a result of the EH Transport acquisition (see Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), increased miles traveled in 2019, and higher transportation rates in full effect in 2019 as a result of negotiations during 2018 with customers. Revenues, net of fuel cost, increased by $8.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily as a result of the higher transportation revenues and miles traveled during 2019.\nOur transportation operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $1.4 million as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense related to the EH Transport acquisition and new assets placed into service and higher insurance expense as a result of more miles traveled during the current year, partially offset by higher revenues as noted above, and lower other operating expenses.\nFuel costs decreased by $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily as a result of a decrease in the price of diesel during 2019 as compared to 2018, partially offset by an increase in miles traveled.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily as a result of the acquisition of the assets of EH Transport during the second quarter of 2019 and the purchase of new tractors in 2018 and 2019.\nMaintenance expense decreased by $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, as a result of the purchase of new tractors and the retirement of older tractors, as the age of our fleet has decreased.\nEquipment additions and retirements for the transportation fleet were as follows for the periods indicated:\n________________\n(1)2020 amounts do not include 163 tractors and 328 trailers purchased in connection with the CTL asset acquisition in June 2020. Of the 163 tractors purchased as part of the CTL acquisition, 66 tractors have been retired and are not included in the number of units noted in the table.\n(2)2020 amounts do not include 33 tractors and 40 trailers which were acquired under finance lease agreements.\nThe sales of retired equipment in our transportation segment produced gains of approximately $0.2 million, $0.5 million and $0.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOur customers are primarily in the domestic petrochemical industry. Customer demand is affected by low natural gas prices (a basic feedstock cost for the petrochemical industry) and high export demand for petrochemicals. During 2018, we began a strategy of streamlining operations and diversifying offerings in our transportation segment. We have continued to work with customers to increase our transportation rates as well as streamlining operations in low margin areas.\nPipelines and Storage\nOur pipelines and storage segment revenues, operating losses and selected costs were as follows for the period indicated (in thousands):\n____________________\n(1)Represents the period from acquisition, October 22, 2020 through December 31, 2020.\nIn October 2020, we purchased the VEX Pipeline System. The VEX Pipeline System, with truck and storage terminals at both Cuero and the Port of Victoria, Texas, is a crude oil and condensate pipeline system, which connects the heart of the Eagle Ford Basin to the Gulf Coast waterborne market. The VEX Pipeline System includes 56 miles of 12-inch pipeline, which spans DeWitt County to Victoria County, Texas, with approximately 350,000 barrels of above ground storage, two 8 bay truck offload stations, and access to two docks at the Port of Victoria. The VEX Pipeline System can receive crude oil by pipeline and truck, and has downstream pipeline connections to two terminals today, with potential for additional downstream connection opportunities in the future and has a current capacity of 90,000 barrels per day.\nWe are focusing on opportunities to increase our pipeline and storage capacity utilization, by identifying opportunities with our existing and new customers to increase volumes. In addition, we are exploring new connections for the pipeline system both upstream and downstream of the pipeline, to increase the crude oil supply and take-away capability of the system.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to higher personnel costs, included approximately $0.3 million of additional personal expenses related to a voluntary early retirement program and terminations for certain employees, and higher rental expense and director fees in 2020, partially offset by lower insurance costs, audit fees and outside service fees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to the receipt in 2018 of approximately $0.6 million in insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Harvey insurance claims, which reduced expenses in the prior year, and higher outside service fees, audit fees and personnel costs in 2019, partially offset by lower insurance costs and legal fees.\nGain on Dissolution of Investment\nDuring 2019, we received a cash payment from AREC totaling approximately $1.0 million, related to the final settlement of its bankruptcy and dissolution. Of the amount received, approximately $0.4 million was offset against a receivable that had been set up as of December 31, 2018 and $0.6 million was recorded as a gain in our consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes is based upon federal and state tax rates, and variations in amounts are consistent with taxable income (loss) in the respective accounting periods.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) was enacted and signed into law in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, permits net operating losses (\u201cNOL\u201d) incurred in tax years 2018, 2019 and 2020 to offset 100 percent of taxable income and be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes.\nWe are continuing to evaluate the full impact of the CARES Act. However, we have determined that the NOL carryback provision in the CARES Act would result in a cash benefit to us for the fiscal years 2018 and 2019. We carried back our NOL for fiscal year 2018 to 2013, and in June 2020, we received a cash refund of approximately $2.7 million. We have an income tax receivable at December 31, 2020 of approximately $3.7 million for the benefit of carrying back the NOL for the fiscal year 2019 to 2014. We are forecasting an NOL for fiscal year 2020 and expect to carry it back to 2015 and 2016. As a result, we have also included the 2020 provisional amounts in income tax receivable at December 31, 2020. As we are carrying the losses back to years beginning before January 1, 2018, the receivables were recorded at the previous 35 percent federal tax rate rather than the current statutory rate of 21 percent.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had deferred tax liabilities of approximately $12.7 million and $6.3 million, respectively.\nSee Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity is from our cash balance and net cash provided by operating activities and is therefore dependent on the success of future operations. If our cash inflow subsides or turns negative, we will evaluate our investment plan accordingly and remain flexible.\nAt December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had no bank debt or other forms of debenture obligations. We maintain cash balances in order to meet the timing of day-to-day cash needs. Cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) and working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, were as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands):\nAlthough our cash balance at December 31, 2020 decreased by 65.2 percent from December 31, 2019, as discussed further below, we believe current cash balances, together with expected cash generated from future operations, and the ease of financing tractor and trailer additions through leasing arrangements (should the need arise) will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. During June and October 2020, we made cash payments, including acquisition costs, of approximately $9.2 million and $10.6 million, respectively, for the acquisitions of CTL transportation assets and the VEX Pipeline System (see Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). We are also required to pay the remainder of the purchase price for the VEX Pipeline System in four quarterly installments of $2.5 million each during 2021, plus interest of 4 percent per annum. As a result of the uncertainty relating to the economic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also significantly curtailed our capital spending.\nOn December 23, 2020, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (\u201cATM Agreement\u201d) with B. Riley Securities, Inc., as agent (the \u201cAgent\u201d). Pursuant to the ATM Agreement, we may offer to sell shares of our common stock through or to the Agent for cash from time to time. We filed a registration statement initially registering an aggregate of $20.0 million of shares of common stock for sale under the ATM Agreement. The total number of shares of common stock to be sold, if any, and the price the shares will be sold at will be determined by us periodically in connection with any such sales, though the total amount sold may not exceed the limitations stated in the registration statement. We did not sell any shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement in 2020.\nWe utilize cash from operations to make discretionary investments in our crude oil marketing, transportation and pipeline and storage businesses. With the exception of operating and finance lease commitments primarily associated with storage tank terminal arrangements, leased office space, tractors, trailers and other equipment, and payment of our remaining purchase price for the VEX Pipeline System, our future commitments and planned investments can be readily curtailed if operating cash flows decrease. See \u201cOther Items\u201d below for information regarding our operating and finance lease obligations.\nThe most significant item affecting future increases or decreases in liquidity is earnings from operations, and these earnings are dependent on the success of future operations. See \u201cPart I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nCash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities\nOur consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities were as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nOperating activities. Net cash flows used in operating activities was $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash flows provided by operating activities of $46.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net cash flows from operating activities of $90.9 million was primarily due to lower earnings in 2020 and changes in our working capital accounts.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $15.9 million when compared to 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues and a decrease in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased operating expenses, and the timing of collections of accounts receivable and payments of accounts payable.\nAt various times each month, we may make cash prepayments and/or early payments in advance of the normal due date to certain suppliers of crude oil within our crude oil marketing operations. Crude oil supply prepayments are recouped and advanced from month to month as the suppliers deliver product to us. In addition, in order to secure crude oil supply, we may also \u201cearly pay\u201d our suppliers in advance of the normal payment due date of the twentieth of the month following the month of production. These \u201cearly payments\u201d reduce cash and accounts payable as of the balance sheet date.\nWe also require certain customers to make similar early payments or to post cash collateral with us in order to support their purchases from us. Early payments and cash collateral received from customers increases cash and reduces accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date.\nEarly payments received from customers and prepayments to suppliers were as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands):\nWe rely heavily on our ability to obtain open-line trade credit from our suppliers especially with respect to our crude oil marketing operations. During December 2019, we received several early payments from certain customers in our crude oil marketing operations, while during December 2020, we received significantly less in early payments from customers. Our cash balance decreased by approximately $73.7 million at December 31, 2020 relative to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of the timing of the receipt of these early payments received during each year and the decrease in crude oil marketing activities in 2020.\nInvesting activities. Net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $16.4 million when compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $30.7 million in capital spending for property and equipment (see \u201cCapital Projects\u201d below), an increase of $0.8 million in cash proceeds from sales of assets and an increase of $0.4 million in insurance and state collateral refunds in 2020. These decreases in net cash flows used in investing activities were partially offset by an increase in cash paid for asset acquisitions ($10.0 million was paid in October 2020 for the purchase the VEX Pipeline System and $9.2 million was paid in June 2020 for the purchase of the CTL transportation assets, while $5.6 million was paid in May 2019 for the purchase of the EH Transport assets (see Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information)) and the receipt in 2019 of $1.0 million in cash proceeds related to the final settlement of AREC\u2019s bankruptcy.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $16.9 million when compared to 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $24.0 million in capital spending for property and equipment and a decrease of $0.2 million in insurance and state collateral refunds in 2019. These increases in net cash flows used in investing activities were partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for asset acquisitions ($5.6 million was paid in May 2019 for the purchase of the EH Transport assets in our transportation segment, while $10.3 million was paid in October 2018 for the purchase of the Red River assets in our crude oil marketing segment), an increase of $1.6 million in cash proceeds from the sales of assets and the receipt of $1.0 million in cash proceeds related to the final settlement of AREC\u2019s bankruptcy in 2019.\nFinancing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $0.9 million when compared to 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.6 million in principal repayments made for finance lease obligations (see \u201cOther Items\u201d below for information regarding our finance lease obligations). During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we paid aggregate cash dividends of $0.96 per common share, or a total of $4.1 million, and $0.94 per common share, or a total of $4.0 million, respectively.\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $1.5 million when compared to 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.2 million in principal repayments made for finance lease obligations. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we paid aggregate cash dividends of $0.94 per common share, or a total of $4.0 million, and $0.88 per common share, or a total of $3.7 million, respectively.\nCapital Projects\nWe use cash from operations and existing cash balances to make discretionary investments in our businesses. Capital spending was as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n_______________\n(1)Amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, do not include approximately $3.6 million, $4.1 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of tractors acquired under finance leases.\n(2)Amount for the year ended December 31, 2018 does not include approximately $10.3 million of capital spending related to the Red River acquisition.\n(3)Amounts for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 do not include approximately $9.2 million and $6.4 million of capital spending related to the acquisitions of CTL and EH Transport, respectively. Amount for the year ended December 31, 2020 does not include approximately $7.3 million of tractors and trailers acquired under finance leases.\n(4)Amount for the year ended December 31, 2020 does not include approximately $10.0 million of capital spending related to the acquisition of the VEX Pipeline System.\n(5)Amounts relate to leasehold improvements at our corporate headquarters, which is not attributed to any of our reporting segments.\nCrude oil marketing. During 2018, capital expenditures were primarily related to construction of a pipeline connection and a truck loading/unloading facility. Capital expenditures during 2019 were primarily related to the purchase of 43 tractors and other field equipment, and during 2020 were primarily related to the purchase of 16 tractors and other field equipment.\nTransportation. Beginning in 2018, we implemented a plan to improve the age of our transportation fleet. During 2018, we purchased 60 new tractors, and during 2019, we purchased 152 new tractors and 77 new trailers. Capital expenditures during 2020 were primarily related to the purchase of other field equipment. As a result of the uncertainty relating to the economic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we significantly reduced our capital spending in 2020 and, as a result, entered into finance lease agreements for the use of 33 tractors and 40 trailers during 2020. See \u201cOther Items\u201d below for information regarding our finance lease obligations.\nOther Items\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\n___________________\n(1)Amounts represent our principal contractual commitments, including interest, outstanding under finance leases for certain tractors, trailers, tank storage and throughput arrangements and other equipment.\n(2)Amounts represent rental obligations under non-cancelable operating leases and terminal arrangements with terms in excess of one year.\n(3)Amount represents our contractual obligation, including interest, related to the four equal quarterly installments for the remaining purchase price for the acquisition of the VEX Pipeline System in October 2020.\n(4)Amount represents commitments to purchase certain quantities of crude oil substantially in January 2021 in connection with our crude oil marketing activities. These commodity purchase obligations are the basis for commodity sales, which generate the cash flow necessary to meet these purchase obligations.\nWe maintain certain lease arrangements with independent truck owner-operators for use of their equipment and driver services on a month-to-month basis. In addition, we enter into office space and certain lease and terminal access contracts in order to provide tank storage and dock access for our crude oil marketing business. These storage and access contracts require certain minimum monthly payments for the term of the contracts.\nRental expense was as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nInsurance\nOur primary insurance needs are workers\u2019 compensation, automobile and umbrella liability coverage for our trucking fleet and medical insurance for our employees. See Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Insurance costs were as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRelated Party Transactions\nFor information regarding our related party transactions, see Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nFor information regarding recent accounting developments, see Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.\nOutlook\nOur focus in 2021 will be to expand our core businesses while delivering value to our shareholders. We will work to achieve positive results in markets with strong competition and margin pressures throughout all segments of our business.\nOur major objectives for 2021 are as follows:\n\u2022Crude oil marketing - We plan to focus on increasing margins to maximize cash flow and capturing midstream opportunities in an increasingly volatile market. We will utilize a new fleet dispatch and maintenance software system to help drive more efficiency in our fleet operations and lower our operating costs, which we believe will help drive increased profitability. In addition, we will look for opportunities to increase our trucking fleet to add to our overall ability to gather and distribute crude oil.\n\u2022Transportation - We plan to continue to increase truck utilization, upgrade our fleet quality and enhance driver retention and recruitment. We also plan to capitalize on our recent acquisitions to improve quality of revenue through improved efficiencies, and we will continue to look for ways to expand our terminal footprint to put us in a position to better compete for new business.\n\u2022Pipeline and storage - We will focus on opportunities to increase our pipeline and storage capacity utilization, by identifying opportunities with our existing and new customers to increase volumes. In addition, we will explore new connections for the pipeline system both upstream and downstream of the pipeline, to increase the crude oil supply and take-away capability of the system.\n\u2022Strategic business development - We will deploy a disciplined investment approach to growth in our three segments and funding new growth opportunities that are adjacent and complimentary to existing operating activities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn our financial reporting processes, we employ methods, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. These methods, estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each reporting period. Investors should be aware that actual results could differ from these estimates if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. The following sections discuss the use of estimates within our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nValuation and Amortization Methods of Customer Relationship Intangible Assets\nCustomer relationship intangible assets represent the estimated economic value assigned to relationships between an acquisition target and its various customers to whom we did not have a previous relationship. These customer relationships provide us with access to those customers to whom we did not have a previous relationship and allows us to enter product markets in which we have not previously participated.\nIn order to estimate the fair value of the customer relationships, we use a discounted cash flow analysis that relies on Level 3 fair value inputs. Level 3 fair values are based on unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset at the measurement date. The Level 3 inputs generally include such items as the rate of retention of the current customers of the acquisition target as of the valuation date, our historical customer retention rate and projected future revenues associated with the customers. The customers expected to remain with us after the transaction are included in the valuation of the customer relationships. For our existing customer relationship intangible assets, we are amortizing these assets over a period of seven years, using a modified straight-line approach.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying values of our customer relationship intangible assets were $4.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively. See Note 6 and Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nFair Value Accounting\nWe enter into certain forward commodity contracts that are required to be recorded at fair value, and these contracts are recorded as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivatives qualify for, and we elect, cash flow hedge accounting. We had no contracts designated for hedge accounting during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nWe utilize a market approach to valuing our commodity contracts. On a contract by contract, forward month by forward month basis, we obtain observable market data for valuing our contracts that typically have durations of less than 18 months. At December 31, 2020, all of our market value measurements were based on inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs). See discussion under \u201cFair Value Measurements\u201d in Note 2 and Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur fair value contracts give rise to market risk, which represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of a particular commitment. We monitor and manage our exposure to market risk to ensure compliance with our risk management policies. These risk management policies are regularly assessed to ensure their appropriateness given our objectives, strategies and current market conditions.\nLiability and Contingency Accruals, including those related to Insurance Liabilities\nWe establish a liability under the automobile and workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies for expected claims incurred but not reported on a monthly basis. We retain a third-party consulting actuary to establish loss development factors, based on historical claims experience as well as industry experience. We apply those factors to current claims information to derive an estimate of the ultimate claims liability. See Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nFrom time to time as incidental to our operations, we become involved in various accidents, lawsuits and/or disputes. As an operator of an extensive trucking fleet, we are a party to motor vehicle accidents, worker compensation claims or other items of general liability as are typical for the industry. In addition, we have extensive operations that must comply with a wide variety of tax laws, environmental laws and labor laws, among others. Should an incident occur, we evaluate the claim based on its nature, the facts and circumstances and the applicability of insurance coverage. When our assessment indicates that it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we make appropriate accruals or disclosure. We base our estimates on all known facts at the time and our assessment of the ultimate outcome, including consultation with external experts and counsel. We revise these estimates as additional information is obtained or resolution is achieved. At December 31, 2020, we do not believe any of our outstanding legal matters would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d) and all related Accounting Standards Updates by applying the modified retrospective approach to all contracts that were not completed on January 1, 2018. The new revenue standard\u2019s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new revenue standard requires entities to recognize revenue through the application of a five-step model, which includes: identification of the contract; identification of the performance obligations; determination of the transaction price; allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and recognition of revenue as the entity satisfies the performance obligations.\nOur revenues are primarily generated from the marketing, transportation, storage and terminalling of crude oil and other related products and the tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals, pressurized gases, asphalt and dry bulk. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in ASC 606. To identify the performance obligations, we considered all of the products or services promised in the contracts with customers, whether explicitly stated or implied based on customary business practices. Revenue is recognized when, or as, each performance obligation is satisfied under terms of the contract. Payment is typically due in full within 30 days of the invoice date.\nCrude oil marketing segment. Crude oil marketing activities generate revenues from the sale and delivery of crude oil purchased either directly from producers or on the open market. Most of our crude oil purchase and sale contracts qualify and are designated as non-trading activities, and we consider these contracts as normal purchases and sales activity. For normal purchases and sales, our customers are invoiced monthly based upon contractually agreed upon terms with revenue recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer, generally upon delivery of the product to the customer. Revenue is recognized based on the transaction price and the quantity delivered.\nThe majority of our crude oil sales contracts have multiple distinct performance obligations as the promise to transfer the individual goods (e.g., barrels of crude oil) is separately identifiable from the other goods promised within the contracts. Our performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time. For normal sales arrangements, revenue is recognized in the month in which control of the physical product is transferred to the customer, generally upon delivery of the product to the customer.\nTransportation segment. Transportation activities generate revenue from the truck transportation of liquid chemicals, pressurized gases, asphalt or dry bulk for customers. Each sales order is associated with our master transportation agreements and is considered a distinct performance obligation. The performance obligations associated with this segment are satisfied over time as the goods and services are delivered.\nPipeline and storage segment. Pipeline and storage activities generate revenue by transporting crude oil on our pipeline and providing storage and terminalling services for our customers. Our operations generally consist of fee-based activities associated with the transportation of crude oil and providing storage and terminalling services for crude oil. Revenues from pipeline tariffs and fees are associated with the transportation of crude oil at a published tariff. We primarily recognize pipeline tariff and fee revenues over time as services are rendered, based on the volumes transported. As is common in the pipeline transportation industry, our tariffs incorporate a loss allowance factor. We recognize the allowance volumes collected as part of the transaction price and record this non-cash consideration at fair value, measured as of the contract inception date.\nStorage fees are typically recognized in revenue ratably over the term of the contract regardless of the actual storage capacity utilized as our performance obligation is to make available storage capacity for a period of time. Terminalling fees are recognized as the crude oil enters or exits the terminal and are received from or delivered to the connecting carrier or third-party terminal, as applicable.\nSee Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to certain risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices.\nCommodity Price Risk\nOur major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our crude oil marketing segment. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing spot prices applicable to crude oil. Commodity price risk in our crude oil marketing operations represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of an asset or a commitment. From time to time, we enter into forward contracts to minimize or hedge the impact of market fluctuations on our purchases of crude oil. In each instance, we lock in a separate matching price support contract with a third party in order to minimize the risk of these financial instruments. Substantially all forward contracts fall within a six-month to eighteen-month term with no contracts extending longer than two years in duration.\nCertain forward contracts are recorded at fair value, depending on our assessments of numerous accounting standards and positions that comply with GAAP in the U.S. The fair value of these contracts is reflected in the balance sheet as fair value assets and liabilities and any revaluation is recognized on a net basis in our results of operations (see Note 2 and Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information).\nHistorically, prices received for crude oil sales have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue. From January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020, our crude oil monthly average wholesale purchase costs ranged from a monthly average low of $14.37 per barrel to a monthly average high of $74.74 per barrel during the same period. A hypothetical ten percent additional adverse change in average crude oil prices, assuming no changes in volume levels, would have reduced earnings by approximately $1.9 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nAdams Resources & Energy, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Adams Resources & Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 5, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nInitial measurement of the fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset acquired in the CTL Transportation, LLC acquisition\nAs discussed in Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements, on June 26, 2020, the Company completed the purchase of assets from CTL Transportation, LLC (CTL) in an asset acquisition. As a result of the transaction, the Company acquired a customer relationship intangible asset associated with the generation of future income from CTL\u2019s existing customers and product lines. The allocation of the purchase price based on the estimated acquisition-date fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was $3.2 million.\nWe identified the evaluation of the initial measurement of the fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset acquired in the CTL transaction as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjectivity was required to assess the internally-developed assumptions used to determine the fair value of the intangible asset, specifically the forecasted revenue attributable to customer contracts and estimated annual attrition rate of existing customers. Subjective auditor judgment was required as there was limited observable market information and the estimated fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was sensitive to possible changes to these assumptions.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s acquisition-date valuation process, including certain controls over the development of the key assumptions noted above. We compared the Company\u2019s estimate of forecasted revenue attributable to customer contracts used in the valuation to the historical results of the Company, CTL and market participants. We evaluated the Company\u2019s estimated annual attrition rate of existing customers by comparing to the historical customer retention rate of the Company. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in (1) assessing the reasonableness of the Company\u2019s revenue growth projections by comparing to those of a market participant and (2) calculating an annual attrition rate of existing customers using CTL\u2019s historical data and comparing that result to the attrition rate used by the Company.\nMeasurement of accrued liabilities for automobile and workers\u2019 compensation claims\nAs discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company establishes accrued liabilities for automobile and workers\u2019 compensation claims reported plus an estimate for loss development and potential claims that have been incurred but not reported to the Company or its insurance provider. The estimates are based on insurance adjusters\u2019 estimates, historical experience and statistical methods commonly used within the insurance industry. The Company retains a third-party actuary to review its accrued liabilities for such claims. As of December 31, 2020, the accrued liabilities for automobile and workers\u2019 compensation were $3.2 million.\nWe identified the assessment of the accrued liabilities for automobile and workers\u2019 compensation claims that have been incurred but not reported as a critical audit matter. Specialized skills and knowledge were required to evaluate the Company\u2019s actuarial models and underlying assumptions made by the Company to estimate these accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported claims. Specifically, the accrued liabilities were sensitive to possible changes to the following key underlying assumptions:\n- incurred and paid loss development factors used in the determination of the ultimate loss\n- initial expected loss rates\n- the selection of estimated loss among estimates derived using different methods.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s process to estimate accrued liabilities for automobile and workers compensation claims that have been incurred but not reported, including controls related to the development of the key assumptions listed above. In addition, we involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n- assessing the actuarial models and procedures used by the Company by comparing them to generally accepted actuarial methods and procedures to estimate the ultimate losses\n- evaluating the Company\u2019s key assumptions and judgments underlying the Company\u2019s estimate by developing an independent range of the incurred but not reported claims and comparing it against the Company\u2019s recorded amount.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2017.\nHouston, Texas\nMarch 5, 2021\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation\nOrganization\nAdams Resources & Energy, Inc. is a publicly traded Delaware corporation organized in 1973, the common shares of which are listed on the NYSE American LLC under the ticker symbol \u201cAE\u201d. Through our subsidiaries, we are primarily engaged in crude oil marketing, transportation, terminalling and storage in various crude oil and natural gas basins in the lower 48 states of the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d). We also conduct tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals, pressurized gases, asphalt and dry bulk primarily in the lower 48 states of the U.S. with deliveries into Canada and Mexico, and with fifteen terminals across the U.S. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d are intended to mean the business and operations of Adams Resources & Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nWe operate and report in three business segments: (i) crude oil marketing, transportation and storage; (ii) tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals, pressurized gases, asphalt and dry bulk; and (iii) beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, pipeline transportation, terminalling and storage of crude oil, which includes the pipeline and related terminal facility assets we acquired in October 2020 (see Note 6 for further information regarding our acquisition). See Note 9 for further information regarding our business segments.\nThe consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions and information we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the operating environment changes. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nWe adhere to the following significant accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable associated with crude oil marketing activities comprise approximately 90 percent of our total receivables, and industry practice requires payment for these sales to occur within 20 days of the end of the month following a transaction. Our customer makeup, credit policies and the relatively short duration of receivables mitigate the uncertainty typically associated with receivables management. We manage our crude oil marketing receivables by participating in a monthly settlement process with each of our counterparties. Ongoing account balances are monitored monthly, and we reconcile outstanding balances with counterparties. We also place great emphasis on collecting cash balances due.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWe maintain and monitor our allowance for doubtful accounts. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on specific identification combined with a review of the general status of the aging of all accounts. We consider the following factors in our review of our allowance for doubtful accounts: (i) historical experience with customers, (ii) the perceived financial stability of customers based on our research, (iii) the levels of credit we grant to customers, and (iv) the duration of the receivable. We may increase the allowance for doubtful accounts in response to the specific identification of customers involved in bankruptcy proceedings and similar financial difficulties. On a routine basis, we review estimates associated with the allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure that we have recorded sufficient reserves to cover potential losses. Customer payments are regularly monitored. However, a degree of risk remains due to the custom and practices of the industry. See Note 18 for further information regarding credit risk.\nThe following table presents our allowance for doubtful accounts activity for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents represent unrestricted cash on hand and highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months from the date of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with major financial institutions, and deposit amounts may exceed the amount of federally backed insurance provided. While we regularly monitor the financial stability of these institutions, cash and cash equivalents ultimately remain at risk subject to the financial viability of these institutions.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, $5.1 million and $9.3 million, respectively, of the restricted cash balance represents amounts held in a segregated bank account by Wells Fargo as collateral for outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2020, $1.5 million of the restricted cash balance relates to the initial capitalization of our newly formed captive insurance company and $6.1 million represents the amount paid to our captive insurance company for insurance premiums.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as reported in the consolidated balance sheets that totals to the amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows at the dates indicated (in thousands):\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCommon Shares Outstanding\nThe following table reconciles our outstanding common stock for the periods indicated:\nDerivative Instruments\nIn the normal course of our operations, our crude oil marketing segment purchases and sells crude oil. We seek to profit by procuring the commodity as it is produced and then delivering the product to the end users or the intermediate use marketplace. As typical for the industry, these transactions are made pursuant to the terms of forward month commodity purchase and/or sale contracts. Some of these contracts meet the definition of a derivative instrument, and therefore, we account for these contracts at fair value, unless the normal purchase and sale exception is applicable. These types of underlying contracts are standard for the industry and are the governing document for our crude oil marketing segment. None of our derivative instruments have been designated as hedging instruments.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing our net earnings by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of common stock outstanding, including our stock related to unvested restricted stock unit awards. Unvested restricted stock unit awards granted under the Adams Resources & Energy, Inc. 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (\u201c2018 LTIP\u201d) are not considered to be participating securities as the holders of these shares do not have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for common shares (see Note 14 for further discussion).\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA reconciliation of the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share was as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share data):\n_______________\n(1)The dilutive effect of restricted stock unit awards for the year ended December 31, 2018 is de minimis.\n(2)The dilutive effect of performance share awards are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share when the performance share award performance conditions have been achieved. The performance conditions for the performance share unit awards granted in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were achieved as of December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the effects of the performance share awards on earning per share were anti-dilutive.\nEmployee Benefits\nWe maintain a 401(k) savings plan for the benefit of our employees. We do not maintain any other pension or retirement plans. Our 401(k) plan contributory expenses were as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurements\nThe carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. Marketable securities are recorded at fair value based on market quotations from actively traded liquid markets.\nOur fair value estimates are based on either (i) actual market data or (ii) assumptions that other market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including estimates of risk, in the principal market of the asset or liability at a specified measurement date. Recognized valuation techniques employ inputs such as contractual prices, quoted market prices or rates, operating costs, discount factors and business growth rates. These inputs may be either readily observable, corroborated by market data or generally unobservable. In developing our estimates of fair value, we endeavor to utilize the best information available and apply market-based data to the highest extent possible. Accordingly, we utilize valuation techniques (such as the market approach) that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA three-tier hierarchy has been established that classifies fair value amounts recognized in the financial statements based on the observability of inputs used to estimate such fair values. The hierarchy considers fair value amounts based on observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) to be more reliable and predictable than those based primarily on unobservable inputs (Level 3). At each balance sheet reporting date, we categorize our financial assets and liabilities using this hierarchy.\nThe characteristics of the fair value amounts classified within each level of the hierarchy are described as follows:\n\u2022Level 1 fair values are based on quoted prices, which are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. Active markets are defined as those in which transactions for identical assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency so as to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. For Level 1 valuation of marketable securities, we utilize market quotations provided by our primary financial institution. For the valuations of derivative financial instruments, we utilize the New York Mercantile Exchange (\u201cNYMEX\u201d) for certain commodity valuations.\n\u2022Level 2 fair values are based on (a) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, (b) quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities but in markets that are not actively traded or in which little information is released to the public, (c) observable inputs other than quoted prices, and (d) inputs derived from observable market data. Source data for Level 2 inputs include information provided by the NYMEX, published price data and indices, third party price survey data and broker provided forward price statistics.\n\u2022Level 3 fair values are based on unobservable market data inputs for assets or liabilities.\nSee Note 6 for a discussion of the Level 3 inputs used in the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired in asset acquisitions.\nFair value contracts consist of derivative financial instruments and are recorded as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivatives qualify for, and we elect, cash flow hedge accounting. We had no contracts designated for hedge accounting during any of the current reporting periods (see Note 12 for further information).\nFair value estimates are based on assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability, and we use a fair value hierarchy of three levels that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Currently, for all items presented herein, we utilize a market approach to valuing our contracts. On a contract by contract, forward month by forward month basis, we obtain observable market data for valuing our contracts. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data.\nImpairment Testing for Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets (primarily property and equipment and intangible assets) are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets with carrying values that are not expected to be recovered through future cash flows are written-down to their estimated fair values. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the asset\u2019s carrying value exceeds the sum of its undiscounted cash flows, a non-cash asset impairment charge equal to the excess of the asset\u2019s carrying value over its estimated fair value is recorded. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at a specified measurement date. We measure fair value using market price indicators or, in the absence of such data, appropriate valuation techniques.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of such items and their respective tax basis (see Note 13 for further information). On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act was enacted into law resulting in a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for years beginning in 2018, which impacts our income tax provision or benefit.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) was enacted and signed into law in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, permits net operating losses (\u201cNOL\u201d) incurred in tax years 2018, 2019 and 2020 to offset 100 percent of taxable income and be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes.\nWe have determined that the NOL carryback provision in the CARES Act would result in a cash benefit to us for the fiscal years 2018 and 2019. We carried back our NOL for fiscal year 2018 to 2013, and in June 2020, we received a cash refund of approximately $2.7 million. We have an income tax receivable at December 31, 2020 of approximately $3.7 million for the benefit of carrying back the NOL for the fiscal year 2019 to 2014. We are forecasting an NOL for fiscal year 2020 and expect to carry it back to 2015 and 2016. As a result, we have also included the 2020 provisional amounts in income tax receivable at December 31, 2020. As we are carrying the losses back to years beginning before January 1, 2018, the receivables were recorded at the previous 35 percent federal tax rate rather than the current statutory rate of 21 percent.\nInventory\nInventory consists of crude oil held in storage tanks and at third-party pipelines as part of our crude oil marketing and pipeline and storage operations. Crude oil inventory is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. At the end of each reporting period, we assess the carrying value of our inventory and make adjustments necessary to reduce the carrying value to the applicable net realizable value. Any resulting adjustments are a component of marketing costs and expenses or pipeline and storage expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018, we recorded a charge of $24.2 million and $5.4 million, respectively, related to the write-down of our crude oil inventory in our crude oil marketing segment due to declines in prices. There were no charges recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLinefill and base gas in assets we own are recorded at historical cost and consist of crude oil. We classify as linefill or base gas our proportionate share of barrels used to fill a pipeline that we own (see Note 6) and barrels that represent the minimum working requirements in storage tanks. Linefill and base gas are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Linefill and base gas are included in \u201cProperty and equipment\u201d on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Affiliate\nWe own an approximate 15 percent equity interest (less than 3 percent voting interest) in VestaCare, Inc., a California corporation (\u201cVestaCare\u201d), which we purchased for a $2.5 million cash payment in 2016. VestaCare provides an array of software as a service (SaaS) electronic payment technologies to medical providers, payers and patients including VestaCare\u2019s product offering, VestaPay\u2122. VestaPay\u2122 allows medical care providers to structure fully automated and dynamically updating electronic payment plans for their patients. We account for this investment under the cost method of accounting. During 2017, we reviewed our investment in VestaCare and determined that the current projected operating results did not support the carrying value of the investment. As a result, during 2017, we recognized an impairment charge of $2.5 million to write-off our investment in VestaCare. At December 31, 2020, we continue to own an approximate 15 percent equity interest in VestaCare.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for additions, improvements and other enhancements to property and equipment are capitalized, and minor replacements, maintenance and repairs that do not extend asset life or add value are charged to expense as incurred. When property and equipment assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in results of operations in operating costs and expenses for the respective period. Property and equipment, except for land, is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated average useful lives of two to thirty-nine years.\nAsset retirement obligations (\u201cAROs\u201d) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from their acquisition, construction, development and/or normal operation. When an ARO is incurred, we record a liability for the ARO and capitalize an equal amount as an increase in the carrying value of the related long-lived asset. ARO amounts are measured at their estimated fair value using expected present value techniques. Over time, the ARO liability is accreted to its present value (through accretion expense), and the capitalized amount is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related long-lived asset. We will incur a gain or loss to the extent that our ARO liabilities are not settled at their recorded amounts.\nSee Note 5 for additional information regarding our property and equipment and AROs.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (\u201cASU 2019-12\u201d). This new standard eliminates certain exceptions in Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 740 related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. It also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted in any interim period within that year.\nWe elected to early adopt this standard during the period ended June 30, 2020, and most amendments within the standard were required to be applied on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2020, while certain amendments were applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. The most significant impact to us is the removal of a limit on the tax benefit recognized on pre-tax losses in interim periods, which was required to be applied on a prospective basis. As a result of our adoption of ASU 2019-12, we calculated our quarterly income tax benefits based on ordinary losses incurred during the first and second quarters of 2020, no longer limiting the computed benefit if it exceeds the amount of benefit that would be recognized if the year-to-date ordinary loss were the anticipated ordinary loss for the full fiscal year.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure all share-based payment awards, including the issuance of restricted stock unit awards and performance share unit awards to employees and board members, using a fair-value based method. The cost of services received from employees and non-employee board members in exchange for awards of equity instruments is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on the estimated fair value of those awards on the grant date and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The fair value of restricted stock unit awards and performance share unit awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. We account for forfeitures as they occur. See Note 14 for additional information regarding our 2018 LTIP.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 3. Revenue Recognition\nAdoption of ASC 606\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d) and all related Accounting Standards Updates by applying the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed on January 1, 2018. The modified retrospective approach required us to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on January 1, 2018. Comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the historical accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of the new revenue standard did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment to our retained earnings since there was no significant impact upon adoption of the new standard. There was also no material impact to revenues, or any other financial statement line items for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of applying ASC 606. We expect the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 to remain immaterial to our net earnings on an ongoing basis.\nRevenue Recognition\nASC 606\u2019s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new revenue standard requires entities to recognize revenue through the application of a five-step model, which includes: identification of the contract; identification of the performance obligations; determination of the transaction price; allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and recognition of revenue as the entity satisfies the performance obligations.\nOur revenues are primarily generated from the marketing, transportation, storage and terminalling of crude oil and other related products and the tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals, pressurized gases, asphalt and dry bulk. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in ASC 606. To identify the performance obligations, we considered all of the products or services promised in the contracts with customers, whether explicitly stated or implied based on customary business practices. Revenue is recognized when, or as, each performance obligation is satisfied under terms of the contract. Payment is typically due in full within 30 days of the invoice date.\nThe following information describes the nature of our significant revenue streams by segment and type:\nCrude oil marketing segment. Crude oil marketing activities generate revenues from the sale and delivery of crude oil purchased either directly from producers or on the open market. Most of our crude oil purchase and sale contracts qualify and are designated as non-trading activities, and we consider these contracts as normal purchases and sales activity. For normal purchases and sales, our customers are invoiced monthly based upon contractually agreed upon terms with revenue recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer, generally upon delivery of the product to the customer. Revenue is recognized based on the transaction price and the quantity delivered.\nThe majority of our crude oil sales contracts have multiple distinct performance obligations as the promise to transfer the individual goods (e.g., barrels of crude oil) is separately identifiable from the other goods promised within the contracts. Our performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time. For normal sales arrangements, revenue is recognized in the month in which control of the physical product is transferred to the customer, generally upon delivery of the product to the customer.\nTransportation segment. Transportation activities generate revenue from the truck transportation of liquid chemicals, pressurized gases, asphalt or dry bulk from point A to point B for customers. Each sales order is associated with our master transportation agreements and is considered a distinct performance obligation. The performance obligations associated with this segment are satisfied over time as the goods and services are delivered.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPipeline and storage segment. Pipeline and storage activities generate revenue by transporting crude oil on our pipeline and providing storage and terminalling services for our customers. Our operations generally consist of fee-based activities associated with the transportation of crude oil and providing storage and terminalling services for crude oil. Revenues from pipeline tariffs and fees are associated with the transportation of crude oil at a published tariff. We primarily recognize pipeline tariff and fee revenues over time as services are rendered, based on the volumes transported. As is common in the pipeline transportation industry, our tariffs incorporate a loss allowance factor. We recognize the allowance volumes collected as part of the transaction price and record this non-cash consideration at fair value, measured as of the contract inception date.\nStorage fees are typically recognized in revenue ratably over the term of the contract regardless of the actual storage capacity utilized as our performance obligation is to make available storage capacity for a period of time. Terminalling fees are recognized as the crude oil enters or exits the terminal and is received from or delivered to the connecting carrier or third-party terminal, as applicable.\nPractical Expedients\nIn connection with our adoption of ASC 606, we reviewed our revenue contracts for impact upon adoption. For example, our revenue contracts often include promises to transfer various goods and services to a customer. Determining whether goods and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together will continue to require continual assessment. We also used practical expedients permitted by ASC 606 when applicable. These practical expedients included:\n\u2022Applying the new guidance only to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018; and\n\u2022Not accounting for the effects of significant financing components if the company expects that the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities) on our consolidated balance sheets. Currently, we do not record any contract assets in our financial statements due to the timing of revenue recognized and when our customers are billed. Our crude oil marketing customers are generally billed monthly based on contractually agreed upon terms. However, we sometimes receive advances or deposits from customers before revenue is recognized, resulting in contract liabilities. These contract assets and liabilities, if any, are reported on our consolidated balance sheets at the end of each reporting period.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRevenue Disaggregation\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by segment and by major source for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n_______________\n(1)On October 22, 2020, we acquired a crude oil pipeline and related terminal facility assets, resulting in a new operating segment. See Note 6 and Note 9 for further information.\n(2)Other crude oil marketing revenues are recognized under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and ASC 845, Nonmonetary Transactions - Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty.\nOther Crude Oil Marketing Revenue\nCertain of the commodity purchase and sale contracts utilized by our crude oil marketing segment qualify as derivative instruments with certain specifically identified contracts also designated as trading activity. From the time of contract origination, these contracts are marked-to-market and recorded on a net revenue basis in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCertain of our crude oil contracts may be with a single counterparty to provide for similar quantities of crude oil to be bought and sold at different locations. These contracts are entered into for a variety of reasons, including effecting the transportation of the commodity, to minimize credit exposure, and/or to meet the competitive demands of the customer. These buy/sell arrangements are reflected on a net revenue basis in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nReporting these crude oil contracts on a gross revenue basis would increase our reported revenues as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nNote 4. Prepayments and Other Current Assets\nThe components of prepayments and other current assets were as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands):\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC.

Accumulated amortization of the assets presented as \u201cFinance lease ROU assets\u201d was $5.0 million and $2.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(2)Linefill and base gas represents crude oil in the VEX pipeline (Note 6) and storage tanks we own, and the crude oil is recorded at historical cost.\nComponents of depreciation and amortization expense were as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nGains on Sales of Assets\nWe sold certain used tractors, trailers and other equipment and recorded net pre-tax gains as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe record AROs for the estimated retirement costs associated with certain tangible long-lived assets. The estimated fair value of AROs are recorded in the period in which they are incurred and the corresponding cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its then present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. If the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, an increase or decrease to expense is recognized. The following table reflects a summary of our AROs for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nNote 6. Acquisitions\nAcquisition of Pipeline and Related Terminal Facility Assets\nOn October 22, 2020, we and our subsidiary, GulfMark Terminals, LLC (\u201cGMT\u201d) entered into a purchase and sale agreement with EnLink Midstream Operating, L.P. for the purchase of the outstanding equity interests of Victoria Express Pipeline, LLC (\u201cVEX\u201d) and certain related pipeline terminal facility assets for $20.0 million, plus a cash payment for working capital items. Of the purchase price, $10.0 million was paid at closing, with the remainder to be paid in four quarterly installments of $2.5 million, plus interest at a rate of 4.0 percent per annum, beginning in March 2021. The equity interests in GMT, VEX and the other acquired assets were pledged to secure the payment of the installment portions of the purchase price as part of the agreement.\nThe VEX Pipeline System, with truck and storage terminals at both Cuero and the Port of Victoria, Texas, is a crude oil and condensate pipeline system, which connects the heart of the Eagle Ford Basin to the Gulf Coast waterborne market. The VEX Pipeline System includes 56 miles of 12-inch pipeline, which spans DeWitt County to Victoria County, Texas, with 350,000 barrels of above ground storage, two 8 bay truck offload stations, and access to two docks at the Port of Victoria. The VEX Pipeline System can receive crude oil by pipeline and truck, and has downstream pipeline connections to two terminals today, with potential for additional downstream connection opportunities in the future. The pipeline system has a current capacity of 90,000 barrels per day.\nThe VEX Pipeline System and related terminal assets have been included in our new pipeline and storage segment. We expect that this acquisition will further strengthen our ability to provide excellent service to the producers in the Gulf Coast region, as well as more effectively service our end-user markets along the Gulf Coast. In addition, the VEX Pipeline System complements our existing storage terminal and dock at the Port of Victoria, where we now control approximately 450,000 barrels of storage with three docks after giving effect to the acquisition.\nIn addition to the purchase price of $20.0 million and a cash payment of $0.5 million for working capital items, we also incurred approximately $0.6 million of acquisition costs in connection with this acquisition, which has been included in the allocation of the total purchase price of $21.0 million to the assets acquired.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price based on the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the acquisition date (in thousands):\nThe estimated fair value of the acquired property and equipment was determined using the cost approach, specifically determining the replacement cost value of each type of asset.\nIn connection with the acquisition, we recorded an asset retirement obligation of approximately $0.7 million related to legal and regulatory requirements to perform specified retirement activities, including purging and sealing the pipeline if it is abandoned.\nCTL\nOn May 17, 2020, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Comcar Industries, Inc. (\u201cComcar\u201d), a bulk carrier trucking company, for the purchase of substantially all of the transportation assets of Comcar\u2019s subsidiary, CTL Transportation, LLC (\u201cCTL\u201d). CTL provides short-haul delivery services to customers in the chemical industry, with operations in nine locations in the southeastern United States. On June 26, 2020, we closed on the asset acquisition for approximately $9.0 million in cash. This acquisition added approximately 163 tractors and 328 trailers to our existing transportation fleet, and these assets were included in our transportation segment. This acquisition added new customers, new market areas and new product lines to our transportation segment portfolio. As a result of the acquisition, we added services to new and existing customers in six new market areas, including new terminals in Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, Georgia and Florida.\nWe also incurred approximately $0.1 million of acquisition costs in connection with this acquisition, which has been included in the allocation of the total purchase price of $9.2 million to the assets acquired.\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price based on the estimated fair value of the assets acquired at the acquisition date (in thousands):\nThe estimated fair value of the acquired property and equipment was determined using the estimated market value of each type of asset. The estimated fair value of the acquired customer relationship intangible assets was determined using an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow analysis. The income approach estimates the future benefits of the customer relationships and deducts the expenses incurred in servicing the relationships and the contributions from the other business assets to derive the future net benefits of these assets. The future net benefits are discounted back to present value using the appropriate discount rate, which results in the value of the customer relationships.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA customer relationship intangible asset is the relationship between CTL and various customers to whom we did not have a previous relationship. The customer relationships we acquired in this transaction provide us with access to those customers to whom we did not have a previous relationship and allows us to enter product markets in which we have not previously participated. Because of the highly competitive and fragmented transportation market, we believe access to these customers will provide us with an entry into new market areas.\nThe discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate the fair value of the CTL customer relationships relied on Level 3 fair value inputs. Level 3 fair values are based on unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset at the measurement date. With respect to the CTL customer relationships, the Level 3 inputs included the rate of retention of the current customers of CTL as of the valuation date, our transportation segment\u2019s historical customer retention rate and projected future revenues associated with the customers. The CTL customers expected to remain with us after the transaction were included in the valuation of the customer relationships. We are amortizing the customer relationship intangible assets over a period of seven years, using a modified straight-line approach. See Note 8 for further information regarding our intangible assets.\nIn connection with the acquisition, we entered into a finance lease agreement for an additional 40 trailers with a six year term. See Note 16 for further information regarding finance leases.\nEH Transport\nOn April 10, 2019, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with EH Transport, Inc. and affiliates (collectively, \u201cEH Transport\u201d), a Houston, Texas based bulk carrier trucking company, for the purchase of certain transportation assets. On May 6, 2019, we closed on the asset acquisition for approximately $6.4 million, which consisted of $5.6 million in cash after post-closing adjustments related to equipment qualifications, 11,145 of our common shares valued at $0.4 million and contingent consideration valued at approximately $0.4 million.\nThis acquisition added approximately 39 tractors and 51 trailers to our existing transportation fleet, and these assets were included in our transportation segment. This acquisition added new customers and new product lines to our transportation segment portfolio, which allows us to grow into new markets. As a result of the acquisition, in addition to general chemical products, we transport liquefied petroleum gas, asphalt and bleach for customers.\nWe incurred approximately $0.1 million of acquisition costs in connection with this acquisition, which has been included in the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired.\nThe following table summarizes the consideration paid for the EH Transport assets and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired at the acquisition date (in thousands):\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe fair market value of the common shares issued in this transaction was determined based upon the closing share price of AE common stock on May 6, 2019 of $35.15.\nWe assumed no liabilities in this acquisition. The estimated fair value of the acquired property and equipment was determined using the estimated market value of each type of asset. The estimated fair value of the acquired customer relationship intangible assets was determined using an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow analysis. The income approach estimates the future benefits of the customer relationships and deducts the expenses incurred in servicing the relationships and the contributions from the other business assets to derive the future net benefits of these assets.

The EH Transport customers expected to remain with us after the transaction were included in the valuation of the customer relationships. We are amortizing the customer relationship intangible assets over a period of seven years, using a modified straight-line approach. See Note 8 for further information regarding our intangible assets.\nThe purchase and sale agreement included a contingent consideration arrangement that required us to pay the former owner of the assets up to a quarterly maximum amount of $146,875 (undiscounted) plus interest for the first four quarters following the closing date of the acquisition. The amount to be paid was based upon the number of qualified truck drivers that were employed by us at the end of each quarter. The potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that could be required to be paid under the contingent consideration arrangement was between $0 and $587,500. The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement of $0.4 million was estimated by applying an income valuation approach, which is based on Level 3 inputs, including the number of qualified truck drivers we expect will be employed at each payment date. At December 31, 2020, all amounts outstanding under the contingent consideration arrangement had been paid.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRed River\nOn October 1, 2018, we completed the purchase of a trucking company for $10.0 million that owned approximately 113 tractors and 126 trailers operating in the Red River area in North Texas and South Central Oklahoma. This acquisition was included in our crude oil marketing segment from the date of the acquisition. We incurred approximately $0.3 million of acquisition costs in connection with this acquisition, which was included in the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired. The purchase price of approximately $10.3 million was allocated on October 1, 2018 as follows (in thousands):\nNote 7.

Insurance collateral deposits are held by the insurance company to cover past or potential open claims based upon a percentage of the maximum assessment under our insurance policies. Insurance collateral deposits are invested at the discretion of our insurance carrier. Excess amounts in our loss fund represent premium payments in excess of claims incurred to date that we may be entitled to recover through settlement or commutation as claim periods are closed. Interest income is earned on the majority of amounts held by the insurance companies and will be paid to us upon settlement of policy years.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC.

The following table presents our forecast of amortization expense associated with these intangible assets for the years indicated (in thousands):\nNote 9. Segment Reporting\nWe operate and report in three business segments: (i) crude oil marketing, transportation and storage; (ii) tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals, pressurized gases, asphalt and dry bulk; and (iii) beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, pipeline transportation, terminalling and storage of crude oil, which includes the pipeline and related terminal facility assets we acquired in October 2020 (see Note 6 for further information regarding our acquisition). Our business segments are generally organized and managed according to the types of services rendered. See Note 3 for a summary of the types of products and services from which each segment derives its revenues.\nOur Chief Operating Decision Maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) (our Chief Executive Officer) evaluates segment performance based on measures including segment operating (losses) earnings and capital spending (property and equipment additions). Segment operating (losses) earnings is calculated as segment revenues less segment operating costs and depreciation and amortization expense.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC.

Our assessment of the relative significance of these inputs requires judgments.\nWhen determining fair value measurements, we make credit valuation adjustments to reflect both our own nonperformance risk and our counterparty\u2019s nonperformance risk. When adjusting the fair value of derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we consider the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements. Credit valuation adjustments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as credit scores to evaluate the likelihood of default by us or our counterparties. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of our fair value contracts. As a result, applicable fair value assets and liabilities are included in their entirety in the fair value hierarchy.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC.

Stock-Based Compensation Plan\nIn May 2018, our shareholders approved the 2018 LTIP, a long-term incentive plan under which any employee or non-employee director who provides services to us is eligible to participate in the plan. The 2018 LTIP, which is overseen by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, provides for the grant of various types of equity awards, of which restricted stock unit awards and performance-based compensation awards have been granted. The maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2018 LTIP is 150,000 shares, and the 2018 LTIP is effective until May 8, 2028. We began awarding stock-based compensation to eligible employees and directors in June 2018. After giving effect to awards granted and forfeitures made under the 2018 LTIP, and the achievement of performance factors through December 31, 2020, a total of 88,374 shares were available for issuance.\nCompensation expense recognized in connection with equity-based awards was as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nIf dividends are paid with respect to our common shares during the vesting period, an equivalent amount will accrue and be held by us without interest until the restricted stock unit awards and performance share unit awards vest, at which time the amount will be paid to the recipient. If the award is forfeited prior to vesting, the accrued dividends will also be forfeited. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $50,800 and $23,600, respectively, of accrued dividend amounts for awards granted under the 2018 LTIP.\nRestricted Stock Unit Awards\nA restricted stock unit award is a grant of a right to receive our common shares in the future at no cost to the recipient apart from fulfilling service and other conditions once a defined vesting period expires, subject to customary forfeiture provisions. A restricted stock unit award will either be settled by the delivery of common shares or by the payment of cash based upon the fair market value of a specified number of shares, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, subject to the terms of the applicable award agreement. The Compensation Committee intends for these awards to vest with the settlement of common shares. Restricted stock unit awards generally vest at a rate of approximately 33 percent per year beginning one year after the grant date and are non-vested until the required service periods expire.\nThe fair value of a restricted stock unit award is based on the market price per share of our common shares on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service or vesting period.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents restricted stock unit award activity for the periods indicated:\n____________________\n(1)Determined by dividing the aggregate grant date fair value of awards by the number of awards issued.\n(2)The aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock unit awards issued during 2018 was $0.6 million based on a grant date market price of our common shares of $43.00 per share.\n(3)The aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock unit awards issued during 2019 was $0.5 million based on a grant date market price of our common shares of $34.00 per share.\n(4)The aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock unit awards issued during 2020 was $0.5 million based on grant date market prices of our common shares ranging from $24.77 to $26.23 per share.\nUnrecognized compensation cost associated with restricted stock unit awards was approximately $0.3 million at December 31, 2020. Due to the graded vesting provisions of these awards, we expect to recognize the remaining compensation cost for these awards over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years.\nPerformance Share Unit Awards\nAn award granted as performance-based compensation is awarded to a participant contingent upon attainment of our future performance goals during a performance cycle. Performance goals are pre-established by the Compensation Committee. Following the end of the performance period, the holder of a performance-based compensation award is entitled to receive payment of an amount not exceeding the number of shares of common stock subject to, or the maximum value of, the performance-based compensation award, based on the achievement of the performance measures for the performance period. The performance share unit awards generally vest in full approximately three years after grant date, and are non-vested until the required service period expires.\nThe fair value of a performance share unit award is based on the market price per share of our common shares on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service or vesting period. Compensation expense is generally adjusted for the performance goals on a quarterly basis.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC.

The performance factor for awards granted in 2019 was lowered to 0 percent based upon a comparison of actual results for 2019 to performance goals. The performance factor for awards granted in 2020 was increased to 138.5 percent based upon a comparison of actual results for 2020 to performance goals.\n(4)The aggregate grant date fair value of performance share unit awards issued during 2019 was $0.3 million based on a grant date market price of our common shares of $34.00 per share and assuming a performance factor of 100 percent.\n(5)The aggregate grant date fair value of performance share unit awards issued during 2020 was $0.2 million based on grant date market prices of our common shares ranging from $24.77 to $26.23 per share and assuming a performance factor of 100 percent.\nUnrecognized compensation cost associated with performance share unit awards was approximately $0.3 million at December 31, 2020.

Supplemental Cash Flow Information\nSupplemental cash flows and non-cash transactions were as follows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nSee Note 16 for information related to non-cash transactions related to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard.\nNote 16. Leases\nAdoption of ASC 842\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d), which requires lessees to recognize a ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability for leases with terms longer than twelve months. We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019, using a modified retrospective transition method and applied certain optional transitional practical expedients.\nWe elected an optional transition method that allowed application of the new standard at the adoption date and the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption with no adjustment to previously reported results. In accordance with this approach, our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to January 1, 2019 were not revised to reflect the new lease accounting guidance. We also elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed the carry forward of historical lease classification. We did not elect the practical expedient related to hindsight.\nASC 842 changes the way our operating leases are recorded, presented and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements. Upon adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, we recognized a ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability based on the present value of then existing operating lease obligations of approximately $11.4 million on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, there are several key accounting policy elections that we made upon adoption of ASC 842 including:\n\u2022We did not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases and instead record them in a manner similar to operating leases under ASC 840, Leases, lease accounting guidelines. A short term lease is one with a maximum lease term of 12 months or less and does not include a purchase option or renewal option the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise.\n\u2022We have also elected the non-lease component practical expedient for any asset class where lease and non-lease components are comingled and the non-lease component is determined to be insignificant when compared to the lease component.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLease Recognition\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, current liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, current liabilities and long-term finance lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. For determining the present value of lease payments, we use the discount rate implicit in the lease when readily determinable. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments that approximates the rate of interest we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term. At adoption, the ROU asset also includes any lease payment made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nWe are a lessee in noncancellable (i) operating leases for office space, equipment and lease and terminal access contracts for tank storage and dock access for our crude oil marketing business, and (ii) finance leases for tractors, trailers, a tank storage and throughput arrangement in our crude oil marketing business and office equipment. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Our lease agreements have remaining lease terms ranging from one year to approximately eight years. Four of our finance lease agreements for tractors and trailers contain residual value guarantee provisions, which would become due at the expiration of the finance lease if the fair value of the lease vehicles is less than the guaranteed residual value. At December 31, 2020, we have recorded a liability of $1.8 million for the estimated end of term loss related to these residual value guarantees as we expect that we will pay the full amount of the guarantees at the end of the leases.\nOur lease agreements do not contain any leases with variable lease payments (i.e., payments that depend on a percentage of sales of a lessee or payments that increase based upon an index such as CPI), residual value guarantees probable of being paid other than those noted above or material restrictive covenants. Lease agreements with lease and non-lease components are generally accounted for separately when practical. For leases where the lease and non-lease component are comingled and the non-lease component is determined to be insignificant when compared to the lease component, the lease and the non-lease components are treated as a single lease component for all asset classes.\nSome leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term for generally one year with exercise of lease renewal options being at our sole discretion as lessee.\nThe following table provides the components of lease expense the periods indicated (in thousands):\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC.

Commitments and Contingencies\nInsurance\nWe have accrued liabilities for estimated workers\u2019 compensation and other casualty claims incurred based upon claim reserves plus an estimate for loss development and incurred but not reported claims. We self-insure a significant portion of expected losses relating to workers\u2019 compensation, general liability and automobile liability, with a self-insured retention of $1.0 million. Insurance is purchased over our retention to reduce our exposure to catastrophic events. We also share 20 percent of the risk of loss, capped at $1.0 million for any claims in excess of $5.0 million. Estimates are recorded for potential and incurred outstanding liabilities for workers\u2019 compensation, auto and general liability claims and claims that are incurred but not reported. Estimates are based on adjusters\u2019 estimates, historical experience and statistical methods commonly used within the insurance industry that we believe are reliable. We have also engaged a third-party actuary to perform a review of our accrued liability for these claims as well as potential funded losses in our captive insurance company. Insurance estimates include certain assumptions and management judgments regarding the frequency and severity of claims, claim development and settlement practices and the selection of estimated loss among estimates derived using different methods. Unanticipated changes in these factors may produce materially different amounts of expense that would be reported under these programs.\nOn October 1, 2020, we elected to utilize a wholly owned insurance captive to insure the self-insured retention for our workers\u2019 compensation, general liability and automobile liability insurance programs. All accrued liabilities associated with periods from October 1, 2017 through current were transferred to the captive.\nWe maintain excess property and casualty reinsurance programs with third-party insurers in an effort to limit the financial impact of significant events covered under these programs. Our operating subsidiaries pay premiums to both the excess and reinsurance carriers and our captive for the estimated losses based on an external actuarial analysis. These premiums held by our wholly owned captive are currently held in a restricted account, resulting in a transfer of risk from our operating subsidiaries to the captive.\nWe also maintain a self-insurance program for managing employee medical claims in excess of employee deductibles. As claims are paid, the liability is relieved. We also maintain third party insurance stop-loss coverage for individual medical claims exceeding a certain minimum threshold. In addition, we maintain $1.4 million of umbrella insurance coverage for annual aggregate medical claims exceeding approximately $7.5 million.\nOur accruals for automobile, workers\u2019 compensation and medical claims were as follows at the dates indicated (in thousands):\nLegal Proceedings\nOn August 15, 2019, we received a notice from the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) regarding a proposed penalty of approximately $1.2 million for our 2017 tax year information returns. The notice alleged that certain taxpayer identification numbers supplied to the IRS for our returns in 2017 were either missing or incorrect and that certain filings were late. We responded to the IRS on September 25, 2019 disputing the proposed penalty and requested that the amount be waived, abated or a hearing held. On March 11, 2020, we received a response from the IRS indicating that they had reviewed our response and waived the full penalty. As such, this matter will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLitigation\nFrom time to time as incidental to our operations, we may become involved in various lawsuits and/or disputes. Primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet, we are a party to motor vehicle accidents, worker compensation claims and other items of general liability as would be typical for the industry. We are presently unaware of any claims against us that are either outside the scope of insurance coverage or that may exceed the level of insurance coverage and could potentially represent a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nGuarantees\nWe issue parent guarantees of commitments associated with the activities of our subsidiary companies. The guarantees generally result from subsidiary commodity purchase obligations, subsidiary operating lease commitments and subsidiary banking transactions. The nature of these arrangements is to guarantee the performance of the subsidiary in meeting their respective underlying obligations. We would only be called upon to perform under the guarantee in the event of a payment default by the applicable subsidiary company. In satisfying these obligations, we would first look to the assets of the defaulting subsidiary company.\nAt December 31, 2020, parental guaranteed obligations were approximately $24.1 million. Currently, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries has any other types of guarantees outstanding that require liability recognition, except for the residual value guarantees for certain of our finance leases (see Note 16 for further discussion).\nNote 18. Concentration of Credit Risk\nWe may incur credit risk to the extent our customers do not fulfill their obligations to us pursuant to contractual terms. Risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by our customers are a major consideration in our business, and our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to sufficiently eliminate customer credit risk. Managing credit risk involves a number of considerations, such as the financial profile of the customer, the value of collateral held, if any, specific terms and duration of the contractual agreement, and the customer\u2019s sensitivity to economic developments. We have established various procedures to manage credit exposure, including initial credit approval, credit limits and rights of offset. We also utilize letters of credit and guarantees to limit exposure.\nOur largest customers consist of large multinational integrated crude oil companies and independent domestic refiners of crude oil. In addition, we transact business with independent crude oil producers, major chemical companies, crude oil trading companies and a variety of commercial energy users. Within this group of customers, we derive approximately 50 percent of our revenues from three to five large crude oil refining customers. While we have ongoing established relationships with certain domestic refiners of crude oil, alternative markets are readily available since we supply less than one percent of U.S. domestic refiner demand. As a fungible commodity delivered to major Gulf Coast supply points, our crude oil sales can be readily delivered to alternative end markets.\nADAMS RESOURCES & ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following tables reflect the percentages of individual customer sales in excess of 10 percent of our consolidated revenues and individual customer receivables in excess of 10 percent of our total consolidated receivables for the periods indicated. We believe that a loss of any of the customers where we currently derive more than 10 percent of our revenues would not have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nNote 19. Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)\nThe following table presents selected quarterly financial data for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share data):\n____________________\n(1)The first quarter of 2020 includes inventory valuation losses of approximately $24.2 million in our crude oil marketing segment.\n(2)The sum of our quarterly earnings (losses) per share amounts may not equal our full year amounts due to slight rounding differences.",

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d).

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated March 5, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2020. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nHouston, Texas\nMarch 5, 2021",
