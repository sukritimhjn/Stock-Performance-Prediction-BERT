    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nAMREP Corporation was organized in 1961 as an Oklahoma corporation and, through its subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in the real estate business. As of July 1, 2020, the Company employed 15 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. The Company has no foreign sales or activities outside the United States.\nThe Company conducts a substantial portion of its business in the City of Rio Rancho and certain adjoining areas of Sandoval County, New Mexico. References below to Rio Rancho include the City of Rio Rancho and such adjoining areas. The City of Rio Rancho is the third largest city in New Mexico with a population of approximately 98,000.\nLand Development\nAs of July 1, 2020, the Company owned approximately 18,000 acres in Rio Rancho. The Company sells both developed and undeveloped lots to national, regional and local homebuilders, commercial and industrial property developers and others. Activities conducted or arranged by the Company include land and site planning, obtaining governmental and environmental approvals (\u201centitlements\u201d), installing utilities and necessary storm drains, ensuring the availability of water service, building or improving roads necessary for land development and constructing community amenities. The Company develops both residential lots and sites for commercial and industrial use as demand warrants. Engineering work is performed by both the Company\u2019s employees and outside firms, but all development work is performed by outside contractors. The Company markets land both directly and through brokers. With respect to residential development, the Company generally focuses its sales efforts on a limited number of homebuilders, with approximately 97% of 2020 land sales having been made to four homebuilders.\nThe Company opportunistically acquires land, focusing primarily in New Mexico, after completion of market research, soil tests, environmental studies and other engineering work, a review of zoning and other governmental requirements, discussions with homebuilders or other prospective end-users of the property and financial analysis of the project and estimated development costs, including the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements.\nThe Company actively markets its commercial properties in Rio Rancho for sale or lease to tenants. The development of commercial properties for tenants requires, among other things, financing or other sources of funding, which may not be available.\nThe continuity and future growth of the Company\u2019s real estate business, if the Company pursues such growth, will require that the Company acquire new properties in New Mexico or expand to other markets to provide sufficient assets to support a meaningful real estate business. The Company competes with other owners and developers of land, including in the Rio Rancho and Albuquerque area, that offer for sale developed and undeveloped residential lots and sites for commercial/industrial use.\nThe following land holdings in New Mexico are where the Company is currently focusing its residential land activities:\n\u00b7 Lomas Encantadas. Lomas Encantadas is an approximately 430-acre subdivision located in the eastern section of Unit 20 in the City of Rio Rancho. As of July 1, 2020, Lomas Encantadas was planned to have 1,496 residential lots, of which 787 planned residential lots were previously sold by the Company.\n\u00b7 Hawk Site. Hawk Site is an approximately 460-acre subdivision located in the northern section of Unit 25 in the City of Rio Rancho. As of July 1, 2020, Hawk Site was planned to have 1,359 residential lots, of which 357 planned residential lots were previously sold by the Company.\n\u00b7 Enchanted Hills/Commerce Center. Enchanted Hills/Commerce Center is an approximately 1,320-acre subdivision located in the eastern section of Unit 20 in the City of Rio Rancho. As of July 1, 2020, Enchanted Hills/Commerce Center was planned to have 2,982 residential lots, of which 2,912 planned residential lots were previously sold by the Company.\n\u00b7 Paseo Gateway. Paseo Gateway is an approximately 298-acre subdivision located in the southern section of Unit 20 in the City of Rio Rancho. As of July 1, 2020, development work had not commenced at Paseo Gateway.\n\u00b7 North Hills. As of July 1, 2020, the Company had 12 finished lots and 7 lots under development in the North Hills subdivision located in the eastern section of Unit 12 in the City of Rio Rancho.\n\u00b7 New Acquisitions.\no During 2020, the Company acquired the following additional property for development:\n\u00a7 Mariposa. The Company acquired 4 acres in the Mariposa subdivision located north of Unit 25 in the City of Rio Rancho. The property is expected to be developed into 25 residential lots and 1 commercial lot. As of July 1, 2020, all of such lots were under development.\n\u00a7 Tierra Contenta. The Company acquired 5 acres in the Tierra Contenta subdivision located in the City of Santa Fe, New Mexico. The property is expected to be developed into 50 residential lots. As of July 1, 2020, all of such lots were under development.\n\u00a7 Vista Entrada. The Company acquired 3 acres in the Vista Entrada subdivision located in the eastern section of Unit 20 in the City of Rio Rancho. As of July 1, 2020, the property was in the process of being subdivided.\no After April 30, 2020, the Company acquired the following additional property for development:\n\u00a7 Lavender Fields. The Company acquired 28 acres in the Meso AM subdivision located in Bernalillo County, New Mexico. The property is expected to be developed into 82 residential lots. As of July 1, 2020, all of such lots were under development.\n\u00b7 Finished Lot Projects.\no Mariposa. During fiscal year 2018, the Company acquired 41 finished lots in the Mariposa subdivision located north of Unit 25 in the City of Rio Rancho. As of July 1, 2020, all of such lots had been sold.\no La Potencia. During 2019, the Company acquired 22 finished lots in the La Potencia subdivision located in the City of Santa Fe, New Mexico. As of July 1, 2020, all of such lots had been sold.\nThe following table presents information on the developed and under development residential and commercial/industrial land holdings in New Mexico of the Company as of July 1, 2020:\nIn addition to the property listed in the table above, undeveloped property in New Mexico of the Company as of July 1, 2020 included approximately 17,000 acres, of which approximately 20% was property that the Company had 90% contiguous ownership, approximately 30% was property that the Company had at least 50% but less than 90% contiguous ownership and approximately 50% was property that the Company had less than 50% contiguous ownership. High contiguous ownership areas may be suitable for special assessment districts or city redevelopment areas that may allow for future development under the auspices of local government. Low contiguous ownership areas may require the purchase of a sufficient number of adjoining lots to create tracts suitable for development or may be offered for sale individually or in small groups.\nDeveloped lots/acreage are any tracts of land that have been entitled with infrastructure work that is substantially complete.\nAcreage under development is real estate for which entitlement or infrastructure work is currently being completed. However, there is no assurance that the acreage under development will be developed because of the nature and cost of the approval and development process and market demand for a particular use. In addition, the mix of residential and commercial acreage under development may change prior to final development. The development of this acreage will require significant additional financing or other sources of funding, which may not be available.\nThere is no assurance that undeveloped acreage will be developed because of the nature and cost of the approval and development process and market demand for a particular use. Undeveloped acreage is real estate that can be sold \u201cas is\u201d (e.g., where no entitlement or infrastructure work has begun on such property).\nLand sales by the Company during 2020 were as follows:\nLand sales by the Company during 2019 were as follows:\nInfrastructure Reimbursement Mechanisms\nA portion of the Lomas Encantadas subdivision and a portion of the Enchanted Hills/Commerce Center subdivision are subject to a public improvement district. The public improvement district is expected, over a period of at least thirty years commencing in 2020, to reimburse the Company for certain on-site and off-site costs of developing the subdivisions by imposing a special levy on the real property owners within the district. During 2020, the Company collected $113,000 of reimbursements from the public improvement district. The Company may accept discounted prepayments of amounts due under the public improvement district.\nIn addition, the Company instituted private infrastructure reimbursement covenants on a portion of the property in Hawk Site. Similar to a public improvement district, the covenants are expected to reimburse the Company for certain on-site and off-site costs of developing the subject property by imposing a special levy on the real property owners subject to the covenants. The Company has accepted discounted prepayments of amounts due under the public improvement district. During 2020, the Company collected $324,000 in connection with these private infrastructure reimbursement covenants.\n1 Revenues per lot may not calculate precisely due to the rounding of revenues to the nearest thousand dollars.\n2 Revenues per acre may not calculate precisely due to the rounding of acres sold to the nearest acre and the rounding of revenues to the nearest thousand dollars.\nHomebuilding\nIn 2020, the Company commenced operations of its internal homebuilder in New Mexico. The Company\u2019s homebuilding operations did not generate revenue during 2020. The Company expects to offer a variety of home designs at different prices and with varying levels of options and amenities to meet the needs of homebuyers.\nMineral Rights\nThe Company owns certain minerals and mineral rights in and under approximately 55,000 surface acres of land in Sandoval County, New Mexico leased to a third party for a term ending in September 2020 and for as long thereafter as oil or gas is produced and marketed in paying quantities from the property or for additional limited periods of time if the lessee undertakes certain operations or makes certain de minimis shut-in royalty payments. If the lessee or any of its affiliates provides any consideration to obtain, enter into, option, extend or renew an interest in any minerals or mineral rights within Sandoval County, Bernalillo County, Santa Fe County or Valencia County in New Mexico at any time from September 2017 through September 2020, lessee is required to pay the Company an amount equal to the amount of such consideration paid per acre multiplied by 55,000. The lessee is required to assign, or to cause their affiliate to assign, to the Company an overriding royalty interest of 1% with respect to the proceeds derived from any minerals or minerals rights presently or hereinafter owned by, leased by, optioned by or otherwise subject to the control of lessee or any of its affiliates in any part of Sandoval County, Bernalillo County, Santa Fe County or Valencia County in New Mexico. As partial consideration for entering into the lease, the Company received $1,010,000 in fiscal year 2015, of which $76,000 was recorded as revenue in 2019. The Company did not record any revenue in 2020 related to the lease. No drilling has commenced with respect to this property.\nThe Company owns certain minerals and mineral rights in and under approximately 147 surface acres of land in Brighton, Colorado leased to a third party for as long as oil or gas is produced and marketed in paying quantities from the property or for additional limited periods of time if the lessee undertakes certain operations or makes certain de minimis shut-in royalty payments. The lessee has pooled approximately 1,240 acres of minerals and mineral rights, including the Company\u2019s minerals and mineral rights, for purposes of drilling and extraction. After applying the ownership and royalty percentages of the pooled minerals and mineral rights, the lessee is required to pay the Company a royalty on oil and gas produced from the pooled property of 1.42% of the proceeds received by the lessee from the sale of such oil and gas, and such royalty will be charged with 1.42% of certain post-production costs associated with such oil and gas. The lessee commenced drilling with respect to the pooled property in 2019, with initial royalty payments made in 2020. The Company received $608,000 of royalties with respect to the pooled property during 2020 from oil and gas production for the period March 2019 through April 2020. No royalties with respect to the pooled property were received during 2019.\nOther Real Estate Interests\nThe Company is constructing an approximately 14,000 square foot, single tenant retail building on an approximately 1.3 acre property in the Las Fuentes at Panorama Village subdivision in Rio Rancho, New Mexico. The Company owns an approximately 160-acre property in Brighton, Colorado planned for approximately 410 homes and an approximately 5-acre property in Parker, Colorado zoned for commercial use. The Company also owns a 61,000 square foot office and industrial facility and a 143,000 square foot office and industrial facility located in Palm Coast, Florida.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nPrior to April 26, 2019, the Company was also engaged in the fulfillment services business operated by Palm Coast Data LLC (\u201cPCD\u201d) and its affiliates. The fulfillment services business performed fulfillment and contact center services for publications, membership organizations, government agencies and other direct marketers.\nOn April 26, 2019, Palm Coast Data Holdco, Inc. (\u201cSeller\u201d), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (the \u201cMembership Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Studio Membership Services, LLC (\u201cBuyer\u201d). The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Membership Purchase Agreement occurred on April 26, 2019 (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d). Pursuant to the Membership Purchase Agreement, Buyer acquired the Company\u2019s fulfillment services business through the purchase from Seller of all of the membership interests (the \u201cMembership Interests\u201d) of PCD (which owned all of the membership interests of FulCircle Media, LLC) and Media Data Resources, LLC (PCD, FulCircle Media, LLC and Media Data Resources, LLC are collectively referred to herein as the \u201cTarget Group\u201d). The purchase price for the Membership Interests was $1,000,000, which was paid by Buyer to Seller on the Closing Date. Buyer and Seller provided customary indemnifications under the Membership Purchase Agreement and provided each other with customary representations, warranties and covenants.\nIn connection with the Membership Purchase Agreement, PCD entered into a triple net lease agreement, dated as of April 26, 2019 (the \u201c2 Commerce Lease Agreement\u201d), with Two Commerce LLC (\u201cTC\u201d), pursuant to which PCD leased from TC a 61,000 square foot facility located at 2 Commerce Boulevard, Palm Coast, Florida (the \u201c2 Commerce Property\u201d) and a triple net lease agreement, dated as of April 26, 2019 (the \u201c11 Commerce Lease Agreement\u201d), with Commerce Blvd Holdings, LLC (\u201cCBH\u201d), pursuant to which PCD leased from CBH a 143,000 square foot facility located at 11 Commerce Boulevard, Palm Coast, Florida (the \u201c11 Commerce Property\u201d). TC and CBH are subsidiaries of the Company. The term of each lease agreement was originally 10 years. The aggregate annual rent, payable in equal monthly installments in each of the applicable years, subject to a waiver of the payment of rent attributable to the month of May 2019, of the lease agreements was originally Year 1: $1,900,000, Year 2: $1,941,500, Year 3: $1,985,328, Year 4: $2,041,564, Year 5: $2,105,294, Year 6: $2,181,604, Year 7: $2,260,585, Year 8: $2,342,331, Year 9: $2,426,937 and Year 10: $2,514,505. PCD did not pay any rent under the lease agreements from December 2019 through May 2020. Each lease was amended in May 2020 as follows: (a) the expiration of the term of each lease was amended to August 15, 2020; (b) PCD provided the landlords a cash deposit of $260,000 to secure PCD\u2019s obligations under the leases; and (c) PCD paid rent in the amount of $350,000 for the rental period from May 18, 2020 through August 15, 2020.\nIn connection with the transactions contemplated by the Membership Purchase Agreement, the Company (not including the Target Group) retained their obligations under the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plan following the Closing Date. The transactions contemplated by the Membership Purchase Agreement and the associated workforce reduction with respect to the Company resulted in the acceleration of the funding of $5,194,000 of accrued pension-related obligations to the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plan pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d), and the regulations thereunder. The Company notified the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation of the transactions contemplated by the Membership Purchase Agreement and, as permitted by ERISA, made an election to satisfy this accelerated funding obligation over a period of seven years beginning in fiscal year 2021. During 2020, the Company made voluntary contributions to the pension plan of $3,600,000, which eliminated any requirement for the Company to further satisfy the $5,194,000 of accelerated accrued pension-related obligations to the pension plan.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nThe Company maintains a website at www.amrepcorp.com.

Legal Proceedings\nRefer to Item 1 for detail regarding the Membership Purchase Agreement, the 2 Commerce Lease Agreement and the 11 Commerce Lease Agreement.\nIn December 2019, each of TC and CBH filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial District in and for Flagler County, Florida against PCD and the guarantors under the 2 Commerce Lease Agreement and the 11 Commerce Lease Agreement for failure to pay amounts due under the leases. Each complaint included claims for damages and for the eviction of PCD from the 2 Commerce Property and the 11 Commerce Property. In connection with such lawsuits, PCD and the guarantors raised certain claims against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including with respect to the Membership Purchase Agreement, the 2 Commerce Lease Agreement and the 11 Commerce Lease Agreement.\nIn February 2020, Seller, Buyer and PCD entered into a first settlement agreement (the \u201cFirst Settlement Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which Seller, Buyer and PCD agreed to settle their outstanding claims.

From 2014 to September 2017, Mr. Vitale was Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel of the Company and, from 2013 to 2014, he was Vice President and General Counsel of the Company.

    "item_5": "Item 5. Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \u201cAXR\u201d. On July 3, 2020, there were 380 holders of record of the common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is often thinly traded. As a result, large transactions in the Company\u2019s common stock may be difficult to execute in a short time frame and may cause significant fluctuations in the price of the Company\u2019s common stock. Among other reasons, the stock is thinly traded due to the fact that five of the Company\u2019s shareholders beneficially owned approximately 73% of the outstanding common stock as of July 3, 2020. The average trading volume in the Company\u2019s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange over the thirty-day trading period ending on April 30, 2020 was approximately 8,109 shares per day.\nThe Company is an Oklahoma corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of its certificate of incorporation and of Oklahoma law generally prohibit the Company from engaging in \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d with an \u201cinterested shareholder,\u201d as those terms are defined therein, unless the holders of at least two-thirds of the Company\u2019s then outstanding common stock approve the transaction.

    "item_6": "Item 6. Selected Financial Data\nAs a smaller reporting company, the Company has elected not to provide the disclosure under this item.",
    "item_7": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFor a description of the Company\u2019s business, refer to Item 1 of Part I of this annual report on Form 10-K. As indicated in Item 1, the Company, through its subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in one business segment: the real estate business. The Company has no foreign sales. The following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company discloses its significant accounting policies in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements.\nThe preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of those financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Areas that require significant judgments and estimates to be made include: (1) real estate cost of sales calculations, which are based on land development budgets and estimates of costs to complete; (2) cash flows, asset groupings and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long-lived assets (including real estate inventories) and assets held for sale; (3) actuarially determined defined benefit pension plan obligations and other pension plan accounting and disclosures; (4) risk assessment of uncertain tax positions; and (5) the determination of the recoverability of net deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThere are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas. Management bases its critical assumptions on historical experience, third-party data and various other estimates that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most critical assumptions made in arriving at these accounting estimates include the following:\n\u00b7 real estate development costs are incurred throughout the life of a project, and the costs of initial sales from a project frequently must include a portion of costs that have been budgeted based on engineering estimates or other studies, but not yet incurred;\n\u00b7 when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, a test for asset impairment may be required. Asset impairment determinations are based upon the intended use of assets, the grouping of those assets, the expected future cash flows and estimates of fair value of assets. For real estate projects under development, an estimate of future cash flows on an undiscounted basis is determined using estimated future expenditures necessary to complete such projects and using management\u2019s best estimates about sales prices and holding periods. Testing of long-lived assets includes an estimate of future cash flows on an undiscounted basis using estimated revenue streams, operating margins, administrative expenses and terminal values. The estimation process involved in determining if assets have been impaired and in the determination of estimated future cash flows is inherently uncertain because it requires estimates of future revenues and costs, as well as future events and conditions. If the excess of undiscounted cash flows over the carrying value of a particular asset group is small, there is a greater risk of future impairment and any resulting impairment charges could be material;\n\u00b7 defined benefit pension plan obligations and plan accounting and disclosures are based upon numerous assumptions and estimates, including the expected rate of investment return on pension plan assets, the discount rate used to determine the present value of liabilities, and certain employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality;\n\u00b7 the Company assesses risk for uncertain tax positions and recognizes the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities; and\n\u00b7 the Company provides a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets unless, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. In making this determination, the Company projects its future earnings (including currently unrealized gains on real estate inventory) for the future recoverability of net deferred tax assets ($6,080,000 as of April 30, 2020).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPrior to April 26, 2019, the Company had been engaged in the fulfillment services business. On April 26, 2019, the fulfillment services business was sold (refer to Items 1 and 3 of Part I of this annual report on Form 10-K for more detail). The Company\u2019s fulfillment services business has been classified as discontinued operations in the financial statements for 2019 included in this Form 10-K.\nYear Ended April 30, 2020 Compared to Year Ended April 30, 2019\nFor 2020, the Company reported a net loss of $5,903,000, or $0.73 per share, compared to net income of $1,527,000, or $0.19 per share, in 2019. For 2019, results consisted of (i) a net loss from continuing operations of $2,465,000, or $0.30 per share, and (ii) net income from discontinued operations of $3,992,000, or $0.49 per share. For 2020, there was no income from discontinued operations. A discussion of continuing operations and discontinued operations follows.\nContinuing Operations\nFor 2020, the Company reported a net loss $5,903,000, or $0.73 per share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $2,465,000, or $0.30 per share, in 2019. The net loss in 2020 included $8,600,000 of non-cash charges comprised of: (1) a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement charge of $2,929,000 due to the payment of lump sum payouts of pension benefits to 309 former employees and (2) the net non-cash pre-tax impairment charges on other assets of $5,046,000, which amount represented the remaining present value of expected lease payments under the 2 Commerce Lease Agreement and 11 Commerce Lease Agreement deemed to be consideration for the sale of the Company\u2019s fulfillment services business.\nRevenues from continuing operations were $18,783,000 for 2020 compared to $12,754,000 for 2019. Revenues from land sales were $16,641,000 for 2020 compared to $12,313,000 for 2019. Revenues from land sales for 2020 included revenue of $665,000 from the sale of two undeveloped properties in Palm Coast, Florida totaling approximately eight acres.\nThe Company offers for sale both developed and undeveloped lots to national, regional and local homebuilders, commercial and industrial property developers and others. The number of new construction single-family residential starts in Rio Rancho by the Company\u2019s customers and other builders was 621 in 2020 and 443 in 2019. The Company sold 36.8 acres of developed residential land in 2020 at an average selling price of $430,000 per acre compared to 32.9 acres of developed residential land in 2019 at an average selling price of $369,000 per acre. The increase in the average selling price per acre of developed residential land in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to demand for lots by builders and the location of the sold property. The Company sold 52.5 acres of undeveloped residential land in 2020 at an average selling price of $3,000 per acre compared to 32.1 acres of undeveloped residential land in 2019 at an average selling price of $6,000 per acre. The decrease in the average selling price per acre of undeveloped residential land in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to the location of the sold property.\nThe average gross profit percentage on land sales in New Mexico before indirect costs was 16.7% for 2020 compared to 12.5% for 2019. The profit percentage increase is attributable to the demand for lots by builders resulting in higher revenue per developed lot. As a result of many factors, including the nature and timing of specific transactions and the type and location of land being sold, revenues, average selling prices and related average gross profits from land sales can vary significantly from period to period and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods.\nRent revenues were $796,000 for 2020, due to the leasing of the Company\u2019s 61,000 square foot facility and 143,000 square foot facility located in Palm Coast, Florida. There were no comparable rents from the prior year due to the applicable lease agreements being signed in April 2019 as part of the sale of the Company\u2019s fulfillment services business. As described in Item 1 of Part I of this annual report on Form 10-K, the Company did not receive lease payments under the 2 Commerce Lease Agreement and 11 Commerce Lease Agreement from December 2019 through May 2020.\nThe Company recorded non-cash impairment charges on other assets of $5,046,000, which amount represented the remaining present value of expected lease payments under the 2 Commerce Lease Agreement and 11 Commerce Lease Agreement deemed to be consideration for the sale of the Company\u2019s fulfillment services business offset by the receipt of $625,000 pursuant to the First Settlement Agreement. As described in Items 1 and 3 of Part I of this annual report on Form 10-K, the Company did not receive lease payments under the 2 Commerce Lease Agreement and 11 Commerce Lease Agreement from December 2019 through May 2020 and subsequently entered into amendments to the leases amending the expiration date of each lease to August 2020. As a result, the Company will not realize the remaining present value of expected lease payments under the 2 Commerce Lease Agreement and 11 Commerce Lease Agreement deemed to be consideration for the sale of the Company\u2019s fulfillment services business.\nThe Company did not record any non-cash impairment charges on real estate inventory or investment assets in 2020 or 2019. Due to volatility in market conditions and development costs, the Company may experience future impairment charges.\nOther revenues were $1,346,000 for 2020 compared to $441,000 for 2019. Other revenues for 2020 primarily consisted of $608,000 of royalties received during 2020 from oil and gas production for the period March 2019 through April 2020 by a third party lessee with respect to the Company\u2019s mineral rights in Brighton, Colorado, $324,000 of private improvement reimbursements, $113,000 of public improvement reimbursements, forfeited deposits from customers, amortization of deferred revenue and miscellaneous other income items. Other revenues for 2019 primarily consisted of fees, forfeited deposits from customers, non-refundable option payments earned by the Company, amortization of deferred revenue and miscellaneous other income items.\nOperating expenses for real estate increased from $990,000 for 2019 to $1,979,000 for 2020, primarily due to increased employee hiring, bonuses, increased allocations of certain corporate employee costs, increased accruals for real estate taxes and increased health care benefit costs.\nReal estate general and administrative expenses decreased from $625,000 for 2019 to $466,000 for 2020, primarily due to reduced professional fees. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased from $3,589,000 for 2019 to $2,537,000 for 2020, primarily due to new allocations of certain employee costs to operating expenses for real estate, reduced corporate headcount and lower travel and legal expenses. The reduced corporate general and administrative expenses were partly offset by increased real estate taxes of $151,000 which the Company agreed to pay under the Settlement Agreement (refer to Items 1 and 3 of Part I of this annual report on Form 10-K for more detail).\nInterest income, net was $334,000 for 2020 compared to $52,000 for 2019. The increase was primarily due to investment of excess funds in higher yielding savings accounts, interest earned of $191,000 in 2020 on the deferred purchase price related to the sale of the Company\u2019s fulfillment services business and a reduction in interest expense. Beginning in December 2019, the Company discontinued recognizing interest from deferred revenue that originated for the sale of the Company\u2019s fulfillment services business in April 2019 (refer to Items 1 and 3 of Part I of this annual report on Form 10-K for more detail). Interest income, net includes interest expense of $25,000 for 2019 and $0 for 2020. Capitalized interest was $182,000 for 2020 and $115,000 for 2019.\nThe Company recognized a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement charge of $2,929,000 for 2020, due to the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plan paying an aggregate of $7,280,000 in lump sum payouts of pension benefits to 309 former employees. There were no such charges in 2019.\nThe Company\u2019s continuing operations had a benefit for income taxes of $1,722,000 for 2020 compared to a benefit for income taxes of $708,000 for 2019. The difference between the statutory rate and the effective rate of the tax benefit for 2020 was primarily due to adjustments resulting from the finalization of the 2019 tax return when compared to the April 2019 year-end tax provision. As a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations, the Company\u2019s total tax effect of gross unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying financial statements of $58,000 at April 30, 2018 was recognized during 2019.\nDiscontinued Operations\nPrior to April 26, 2019, the Company had been engaged in the fulfillment services business. On April 26, 2019, the fulfillment services business was sold (refer to Items 1 and 3 of Part I of this annual report on Form 10-K for more detail). The Company\u2019s fulfillment services business operated in an industry unrelated to the Company\u2019s continuing operations and had business operations, employees (including its management), customers, suppliers, liquidity and capital resources that were generally different from those of the Company\u2019s continuing operations. The sale of the Company\u2019s fulfillment services business has not had a material impact on the Company\u2019s continuing operations. The Company retained ownership of certain real estate in Palm Coast, Florida (refer to Items 1 and 3 of Part I of this annual report on Form 10-K for more detail). Net income from discontinued operations was $3,992,000, or $0.49 per share, in 2019. The results from discontinued operations for 2019 included a pretax gain of $2,506,000, or $0.31 per share, resulting from the sale of the fulfillment services business.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAMREP Corporation is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries. As a holding company, AMREP Corporation is dependent on its available funds and on distributions of funds from subsidiaries to pay expenses and fund operations. The Company\u2019s liquidity is affected by many factors, including some that are based on normal operations and some that are related to the real estate industry and the economy generally.\nThe Company\u2019s primary sources of funding for working capital requirements are cash flow from operations, bank financing for specific real estate projects and existing cash balances. Land and homebuilding investments generally cannot be sold quickly, and the ability of the Company to sell properties has been and will continue to be affected by market conditions. The ability of the Company to generate cash flow from operations is primarily dependent upon its ability to sell the properties it has selected for disposition at the prices and within the timeframes the Company has established for each property. The development of additional lots for sale, construction of homes or pursuing other real estate projects will require financing or other sources of funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms (or at all). If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCOVID-19 Impact and Response\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. Subsequently, the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to spread and various state and local governments have issued or extended \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, which have impacted and restricted various aspects of the Company\u2019s operations.\nIn response to the pandemic, the Company allowed all employees to work remotely during March and April 2020, with most operations in New Mexico returning to an office setting beginning in May 2020. In New Mexico, the Company\u2019s construction operations have continued functioning during this period subject to regulated restrictions and safety constraints in order to protect the Company\u2019s employees, trade contractors and homebuilder customers. The Company modified many of its common interactions to be virtual and attempted to minimize in-person interactions. While the above-referenced steps are necessary and appropriate in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, they do impact the Company\u2019s ability to operate in its ordinary and traditional course. Those restrictions, combined with a reduction in the availability, capacity and efficiency of municipal and private services necessary to progress land development have reduced the Company\u2019s sales pace and delayed certain projects and deliveries. In addition, some homebuilder customers requested and received restructured closing schedules with respect to existing finished lot contracts with the Company to accommodate their liquidity issues and concerns. The potential magnitude and duration of the business and economic impacts from the unprecedented public health effort to contain and combat the spread of COVID-19 are uncertain. In addition, the Company can provide no assurance as to whether the COVID-19 public health effort will be intensified to such an extent that the Company will not be able to conduct any business operations for an indefinite period.\nIn light of the current challenging economic conditions, the Company has since March 2020 attempted to take a cautious approach to its operations and attempted to protect liquidity and closely manage cash flows, including obtaining a loan pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program loan program administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration, delaying the acquisition of certain land parcels currently under contract, slowing land development where practical, contacting homebuilder customers to reconfirm their ability to perform under their contracts before beginning or continuing construction of finished lots and working with the Company\u2019s financing sources to ensure continued availability under existing credit facilities.\nWhile we cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of this pandemic or if there will be additional periods of increases or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which the Company operates, an extended economic slowdown could materially impact the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated cash flows in fiscal year 2021 or beyond. The Company could be negatively impacted over the medium-to-longer term if the disruptions related to COVID-19 (a) decrease consumer confidence generally or with respect to purchasing a home or cause civil unrest, (b) precipitate a prolonged economic downturn or an extended rise in unemployment or tempering of wage growth, any of which could lower demand for the Company\u2019s products, impair the Company\u2019s ability to sell and build finished lots and homes in a typical manner or at all, impair the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenues and cash flows, or impair the Company\u2019s ability to access the capital or lending markets (or significantly increase the costs of doing so), (c) increase the costs or decrease the supply of construction materials or the availability of subcontractors and other talent, including as a result of infections or medically necessary or recommended self-quarantining, or governmental mandates to direct production activities to support public health efforts or (d) result in the Company recognizing charges in future periods, which may be material, for impairments related to the Company\u2019s inventory or investment assets. The unprecedented uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, due to rapidly changing governmental directives, public health challenges and progress, macroeconomic consequences, and market reactions thereto, also makes it more challenging for the Company to estimate the future performance of the business and develop strategies to generate growth.\nShould the adverse impacts described above (or others that are currently unknown) occur, whether individually or collectively, the Company would expect to experience, among other things, increases in defaults from homebuilder customers for finished lots under contract, and decreases in future demand for finished lots, revenues and profitability. Such impacts could be material to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. The Company could also be forced to reduce its average selling prices in order to generate homebuilder demand or in reaction to competitive pressures. In addition, should the COVID-19 public health effort intensify to such an extent that the Company cannot operate in Rio Rancho, the Company could generate few or no sales during the applicable period, which could be prolonged. If there are prolonged government restrictions on the Company\u2019s operations or the Company\u2019s employees, trade contractors or homebuilder customers, or an extended economic recession, the Company could be unable to produce revenues and cash flows sufficient to conduct operations, meet the terms of the Company\u2019s covenants and other requirements under its financing arrangements or service the Company\u2019s outstanding debt. Such a circumstance could, among other things, exhaust the Company\u2019s available liquidity (and ability to access liquidity sources) or trigger an acceleration to pay a significant portion or all of the Company\u2019s then-outstanding debt obligations, which the Company may be unable to do.\nPension Plan\nThe Company has a defined benefit pension plan for which accumulated benefits were frozen and future service credits were curtailed as of March 1, 2004. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plan was underfunded at April 30, 2020 by $5,014,000, with $18,260,000 of assets and $23,274,000 of liabilities and was underfunded at April 30, 2019 by $6,401,000, with $23,903,000 of assets and $30,304,000 of liabilities. The pension plan liabilities were determined using a weighted average discount interest rate of 2.29% per year at April 30, 2020 and 3.54% per year at April 30, 2019, which are based on the FTSE Pension Discount Curve as of such dates as it corresponds to the projected liability requirements of the pension plan. As of April 30, 2020, for a 0.25% increase in the weighted average discount interest rate, the pension plan liabilities are forecasted to decrease by $68,700 and for a 0.25% decrease in the weighted average discount interest rate, the pension plan liabilities are forecasted to increase by $40,700. As of April 30, 2020, the effect of every 0.25% change in the investment rate of return on pension plan assets would increase or decrease the subsequent year\u2019s pension expense by $42,500, and the effect of every 0.25% change in the weighted average discount interest rate would increase or decrease the subsequent year\u2019s pension expense by $42,500.\nAs noted in Item 1 of Part I of this annual report on Form 10-K, the Company retained its obligations under the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plan following the sale of the Company\u2019s fulfillment services business. The workforce reduction with respect to the Company in connection with the sale of the fulfillment services business resulted in the acceleration of the funding of $5,194,000 of accrued pension-related obligations to the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plan pursuant to ERISA and the regulations thereunder. The Company notified the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation of the sale of the fulfillment services business and, as permitted by ERISA, made an election to satisfy this accelerated funding obligation over a period of seven years beginning in fiscal year 2021. During 2020, the Company made voluntary contributions to the pension plan of $3,600,000, which eliminated any requirement for the Company to further satisfy the $5,194,000 of accelerated accrued pension-related obligations to the pension plan.\nThe Company recognized a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement charge of $2,929,000 in 2020, due to the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plan paying an aggregate of $7,280,000 in lump sum payouts of pension benefits to 309 former employees. There were no such charges in 2019.\nOperating Activities\nReal estate inventory decreased from $57,773,000 at April 30, 2019 to $53,449,000 at April 30, 2020. Inventory in the Company\u2019s core real estate market of Rio Rancho decreased from $53,831,000 at April 30, 2019 to $49,507,000 at April 30, 2020, primarily due to real estate land sales, which were offset in part by an increase in land development activity and the acquisition of property. The balance of real estate inventory primarily consisted of properties in Colorado.\nInvestment assets increased from $17,227,000 at April 30, 2019 to $18,644,000 at April 30, 2020, primarily due to capitalization of costs related to the construction of a single tenant retail building offset in part by the sale of investment land and depreciation. Investment assets include (i) investment land, which represents vacant, undeveloped land not held for development or sale in the normal course of business, (ii) an approximately 14,000 square foot, single tenant retail building under construction on an approximately 1.3 acre property in the Las Fuentes at Panorama Village subdivision in Rio Rancho, New Mexico and (iii) two facilities located in Palm Coast, Florida that aggregate 204,000 square feet.\nOther assets decreased from $6,475,000 at April 30, 2019 to $934,000 at April 30, 2020, primarily due to non-cash impairment charges of the remaining present value of expected lease payments under the 2 Commerce Lease Agreement and 11 Commerce Lease Agreement deemed to be consideration for the sale of the Company\u2019s fulfillment services business. As described in Item 3 of Part I of this annual report on Form 10-K, the Company is not receiving lease payments under the 2 Commerce Lease Agreement and 11 Commerce Lease Agreement.\nTaxes receivable, net decreased from $283,000 at April 30, 2019 to $57,000 at April 30, 2020, primarily due to the receipt of a federal tax refund. Deferred income taxes, net increased from $4,536,000 at April 30, 2019 to $6,080,000 at April 30, 2020, primarily due to the addition of federal net operating loss carry forwards resulting in a deferred tax asset of $ 3,746,000.\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses increased from $2,964,000 at April 30, 2019 to $3,125,000 at April 30, 2020, primarily due to an increase in land development activity in New Mexico.\nThe unfunded pension liability of the Company\u2019s frozen defined benefit pension plan decreased from $6,401,000 at April 30, 2019 to $5,014,000 at April 30, 2020, primarily due to Company contributions to the pension plan and favorable investment results of plan assets during 2020. The Company recorded, net of tax, other comprehensive income of $564,000 in 2020 and other comprehensive income of $903,000 in 2019, reflecting the change in the unfunded pension liability in each year net of the related deferred tax and unrecognized prepaid pension amounts. The Company recognized a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement charge of $2,929,000 for 2020, due to the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plan paying an aggregate of $7,280,000 in lump sum payouts of pension benefits to 309 former employees.\nFinancing Activities\nNotes payable, net increased from $1,319,000 at April 30, 2019 to $3,890,000 at April 30, 2020, primarily due to additional borrowings to fund land development activities and partially offset by repayments made on outstanding borrowings. Given below are descriptions of the Company\u2019s outstanding financing arrangements:\n\u00b7 Lomas Encantadas Subdivision. In 2020, Lomas Encantadas Development Company LLC (\u201cLEDC\u201d), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Development Loan Agreement with BOKF, NA dba Bank of Albuquerque (\u201cBOKF\u201d).

The Company believes that it has adequate cash, bank financing and cash flows from operations to provide for anticipated capital expenditures and land development spending in fiscal year 2021.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of April 30, 2020, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K).\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the financial statements included in this Form 10-K for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company operates in one business segment: real estate.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION\nOperations of the Company\u2019s real estate business can be impacted by inflation. Inflation can cause increases in the cost of land, materials, services, interest and labor. Unless such increased costs are recovered through increased sales prices or improved operating efficiencies, operating margins will decrease. A large part of the Company\u2019s real estate sales are to homebuilders who face their own inflationary concerns that rising housing costs, including interest costs, may substantially outpace increases in the incomes of potential purchasers and make it difficult for them to purchase a new home or sell an owned home. If this situation were to exist, the demand for the Company\u2019s land by these homebuilder customers could decrease. In general, in recent years interest rates have been at historically low levels and other price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in the Company\u2019s markets, and as a result the Company has not found the inflation risk to be a significant problem in its business. Despite low inflation, the Company\u2019s real estate operations are experiencing price increases as a result of recent tariffs and labor and material shortages. Inflation may also increase the Company\u2019s financing costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates affect the affordability of the Company\u2019s homebuilding products to prospective homebuyers. While the Company attempts to pass on to its customers increases in costs through increased sales prices, market forces may limit the Company\u2019s ability to do so. If the Company is unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs, or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly, the Company\u2019s revenues, gross margins and net income could be adversely affected.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. The Company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are \u201cforward-looking\u201d, including statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, reports to the Company\u2019s shareholders and news releases.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls, material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, even internal controls determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Furthermore, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal controls to future periods are subject to the risk that such controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2020 based upon the criteria set forth in a report entitled \u201cInternal Control-Integrated Framework\u201d issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that, as of April 30, 2020, internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThis annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management\u2019s report was not subject to such attestation pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nAMREP Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AMREP Corporation and Subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of April 30, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, shareholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended April 30, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended April 30, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Marcum llp\nMarcum llp\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2017.\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nJuly 24, 2020\nAMREP CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAPRIL 30, 2020 AND 2019\n(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nThe accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an\nintegral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nAMREP CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThe accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an\nintegral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nAMREP CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS) INCOME\n(Amounts in thousands)\nThe accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an\nintegral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nAMREP CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\n(Amounts in thousands)\n-\nThe accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an\nintegral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nAMREP CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(Amounts in thousands)\nThe accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an\nintegral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nAMREP CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES:\nOrganization and principles of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AMREP Corporation, an Oklahoma corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d). The Company, through its subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in one business segment: the real estate business. The Company has no foreign sales. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nPrior to April 26, 2019, the Company had been engaged in the fulfillment services business. On April 26, 2019, the Company\u2019s fulfillment services business was sold. Unless otherwise stated, the information disclosed in the footnotes accompanying the consolidated financial statements refers to continuing operations. See Note 2 for more information regarding results from discontinued operations.\nThe consolidated balance sheets are presented in an unclassified format since the Company has substantial operations in the real estate industry and its operating cycle is greater than one year. Certain 2019 balances in these financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation with no effect on the net income or loss or shareholders\u2019 equity.\nFiscal year\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year ends on April 30. All references to 2020 and 2019 mean the fiscal years ended April 30, 2020 and 2019, unless the context otherwise indicates.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue from land sales: The Company accounts for revenue from land sales in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Revenues from land sales generally consist of real estate land sales and corporate land sales. Revenue from these land sales are recognized when the parties are bound by the terms of a contract, consideration has been exchanged, title and other attributes of ownership have been conveyed to the buyer by means of a closing and the Company is not obligated to perform further significant development of the specific property sold. In general, the Company\u2019s performance obligation for each of these land sales is fulfilled upon the delivery of the land, which generally coincides with the receipt of cash consideration from the counterparty.\nCost of land sales includes all direct acquisition costs and other costs specifically identified with the property, including pre-acquisition costs and capitalized real estate taxes and interest, and an allocation of certain common development costs associated with the entire project. Common development costs include the installation of utilities and roads, and may be based upon estimates of cost to complete. The allocation of costs is based on the relative sales value of the property. Estimates and cost allocations are reviewed on a regular basis until a project is substantially completed, and are revised and reallocated as necessary on the basis of current estimates.\nRental Income: The Company may enter into leases with tenants with respect to property or buildings it owns. Base rental payments from tenants are recognized as revenue monthly over the term of the lease. Additional rent related to the reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses is recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of ninety days or less when purchased and are readily convertible into cash. Restricted cash consists of cash deposits with a bank that are restricted due to subdivision improvement agreements with a governmental authority.\nReal estate inventory\nReal estate inventory includes land and improvements on land held for future development or sale. The Company accounts for its real estate inventory in accordance with ASC 360-10. The cost basis of the land and improvements includes all direct acquisition costs including development costs, certain amenities, capitalized interest, capitalized real estate taxes and other costs. Interest and real estate taxes are not capitalized unless active development is underway. Real estate inventory held for future development or sale is stated at accumulated cost and is evaluated and reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\nInvestment assets\nInvestment assets consist of (i) investment land, which represents vacant, undeveloped land not held for development or sale in the normal course of business, and (ii) real estate assets that are intended to be leased to third parties. Investment assets are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nDepreciation of investment assets (other than land) is provided principally by the straight-line method at various rates calculated to amortize the book values of the respective assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally are 10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements. Land is not subject to depreciation.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nLong-lived assets consist of real estate that are intended to be leased to third parties and are accounted for in accordance with ASC 360-10. Long-lived assets are evaluated and tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Asset impairment tests are based upon the intended use of assets, expected future cash flows and estimates of fair value of assets. The evaluation of operating asset groups includes an estimate of future cash flows on an undiscounted basis using estimated revenue streams, operating margins and general and administrative expenses. The estimation process involved in determining if assets have been impaired and in the determination of estimated future cash flows is inherently uncertain because it requires estimates of future revenues and costs, as well as future events and conditions. If the excess of undiscounted cash flows over the carrying value of a project is small, there is a greater risk of future impairment and any resulting impairment charges could be material. Due to the subjective nature of the estimates and assumptions used in determining future cash flows, actual results could differ materially from current estimates and the Company may be required to recognize impairment charges in the future\nLeases\nRight-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recorded on the balance sheet for all leases with an initial term over one year. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. Right-of-use assets are classified within other assets and the corresponding lease liability is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet.\nShare-based compensation\nThe Company accounts for awards of restricted stock and deferred stock units in accordance with ASC 718-10, which requires that compensation cost for all stock awards be calculated and amortized over the service period (generally equal to the vesting period). Compensation expense for awards of restricted stock and deferred stock units are based on the fair value of the awards at their grant dates.\nIncome taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured by using currently enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to reverse. The Company provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets unless, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nEarnings (loss) per share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year. Unvested restricted shares of common stock (see Note 11) are not included in the computation of basic earnings per share, as they are considered contingently returnable shares. Unvested restricted shares of common stock are included in diluted earnings per share if they are dilutive. Deferred stock units (see Note 11) are included in both basic and diluted earnings per share computations.\nPension plan\nThe Company recognizes the over-funded or under-funded status of its defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability as of the date of the plan\u2019s year-end statement of financial position and recognizes changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income (loss).\nComprehensive income\nComprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events from non-owner sources. Total comprehensive income is the total of net income or loss and other comprehensive income or loss that, for the Company, consists of the minimum pension liability net of the related deferred income tax effect.\nManagement\u2019s estimates and assumptions\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates that affect the financial statements include, but are not limited to, (i) real estate cost of sales calculations, which are based on land development budgets and estimates of costs to complete; (ii) cash flows, asset groupings and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long-lived assets and assets held for sale; (iii) actuarially determined benefit obligations and other pension plan accounting and disclosures; (iv) risk assessment of uncertain tax positions; and (v) the determination of the recoverability of net deferred tax assets. The Company bases its significant estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nDiscontinued operations\nThe Company records discontinued operations when the disposal of a separately identified business unit constitutes a strategic shift in the Company\u2019s operations, as defined in ASC Topic 205-20, Discontinued Operations.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. Since that date, the FASB has issued additional ASUs providing further guidance for lease transactions (collectively \u201cASU 2016-02\u201d). ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. A lessee should recognize in its balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of twelve months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. During 2020, right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities amounted to $198,000 as a result of adoption of ASU 2016-02. In addition, ASU 2016-02 requires the lessor to recognize fixed lease payments under tenant leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. The cumulative difference between lease revenue recognized under the straight-line method and contractual lease payments is recorded within Other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. As permitted by the ASU 2016-02, the Company elected to carry forward its historical lease classifications. ASU 2016-02 was effective for the Company on May 1, 2019, with the Company recognizing and measuring leases using a modified retrospective approach. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 by the Company did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2019-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which permits but does not require the reclassification to retained earnings of certain tax effects resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act related to items in accumulated other comprehensive income. ASU 2018-02 may be applied retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recognized or may be applied in the period of adoption. ASU 2018-02 was effective for the Company on May 1, 2019. The Company opted not to reclassify items from other comprehensive income to retained earnings, as was permitted by ASU 2018-02; therefore, the adoption of ASU 2018-02 had no impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) - Improvements to Nonemployee Share-based Payment Accounting. ASU 2018-07 addresses several aspects of the accounting for nonemployee share-based payment transactions, including share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. ASU 2018-07 was effective for the Company on May 1, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2018-07 by the Company had no impact on its consolidated financial statements\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement: Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.

After applying the ownership and royalty percentages of the pooled minerals and mineral rights, the lessee is required to pay the Company a royalty on oil and gas produced from the pooled property of 1.42% of the proceeds received by the lessee from the sale of such oil and gas, and such royalty will be charged with 1.42% of certain post-production costs associated with such oil and gas. The lessee commenced drilling with respect to the pooled property in 2019, with initial royalty payments made in 2020. The Company received $608,000 of royalties with respect to the pooled property during 2020 from oil and gas production for the period March 2019 through April 2020. No royalties with respect to the pooled property were received during 2019.\nA portion of the Lomas Encantadas subdivision and a portion of the Enchanted Hills/Commerce Center subdivision are subject to a public improvement district. The public improvement district reimburses the Company for certain on-site and off-site costs of developing the subdivisions by imposing a special levy on the real property owners within the district. During 2020, the Company collected $113,000 of reimbursements from the public improvement district. The Company may accept discounted prepayments of amounts due under the public improvement district.\nThe Company instituted private infrastructure reimbursement covenants on a portion of the property in Hawk Site. Similar to a public improvement district, the covenants are expected to reimburse the Company for certain on-site and off-site costs of developing the subject property by imposing a special levy on the real property owners subject to the covenants. The Company has accepted discounted prepayments of amounts due under the public improvement district. During 2020, the Company collected $324,000 in connection with these private infrastructure reimbursement covenants.\n(10) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS:\nThe FASB\u2019s accounting guidance defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The FASB\u2019s guidance classifies the inputs to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1 Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 Inputs for the asset or liability are unobservable and reflect the reporting entity\u2019s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe fair value measurement level of an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during 2020 or 2019.\nThe Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. The Topic excludes all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Fair value is determined under the hierarchy discussed above. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. The following methods and assumptions are used in estimating fair value disclosure for financial instruments: the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and trade payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments; and debt that bears variable interest rates indexed to prime or LIBOR also approximates fair value as it reprices when market interest rates change.\n(11) BENEFIT PLANS:\nPension plan\nThe Company has a defined benefit pension plan for which accumulated benefits were frozen and future service credits were curtailed as of March 1, 2004. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plan was underfunded at April 30, 2020 by $5,014,000, with $18,260,000 of assets and $23,274,000 of liabilities and was underfunded at April 30, 2019 by $6,401,000, with $23,903,000 of assets and $30,304,000 of liabilities. The pension plan liabilities were determined using a weighted average discount interest rate of 2.29% per year at April 30, 2020 and 3.54% per year at April 30, 2019, which are based on the FTSE Pension Discount Curve as of such dates as it corresponds to the projected liability requirements of the pension plan.\nThe closing of certain Company facilities in fiscal year 2011 and the associated workforce reduction resulted in the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation requiring the Company to accelerate the funding of $11,688,000 of accrued pension-related obligations to the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plan pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d), and the regulations thereunder. The Company entered into a settlement agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in fiscal year 2014 with respect to such liability. The settlement agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation terminated by its terms in 2019 with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation being deemed to have released and discharged the Company and all other members of its controlled group from any claims under the settlement agreement or with respect to such liability.\nIn connection with the transactions contemplated by the Membership Purchase Agreement described in Note 2, the Company (not including the Target Group) retained their obligations under the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plan following the Closing Date. The transactions contemplated by the Membership Purchase Agreement and the associated workforce reduction with respect to the Company resulted in the acceleration of the funding of $5,194,000 of accrued pension-related obligations to the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plan pursuant to ERISA. The Company notified the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation of the transactions contemplated by the Membership Purchase Agreement and, as permitted by ERISA, made an election to satisfy this accelerated funding obligation over a period of seven years beginning in fiscal year 2021. During 2020, the Company made voluntary contributions to the pension plan of $3,600,000, which eliminated any requirement for the Company to further satisfy the $5,194,000 of accelerated accrued pension-related obligations to the pension plan.\nThe Company recognized a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement charge of $2,929,000 in 2020. This charge resulted from the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plan paying an aggregate of $7,280,000 in lump sum payouts of pension benefits to 309 former employees. There were no such charges in 2019.\nPension assets and liabilities are measured at fair value (measured in accordance with the guidance described in Note 10) and are subject to fair value adjustment in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). There were no impairments resulting in a change in fair value during 2020 and 2019.\nNet periodic pension cost for 2020 and 2019 was comprised of the following components (in thousands):\nThe estimated net loss, transition obligation and prior service cost for the pension plan that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost over fiscal year 2021 are $529,000, $0 and $0. Assumptions used in determining net periodic pension cost and the benefit obligation were:\nThe following table sets forth changes in the pension plan\u2019s benefit obligation and assets, and summarizes components of amounts recognized in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet (in thousands):\nThe funded status of the pension plan is equal to the net liability recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which have not yet been recognized as a component of net periodic pension costs (in thousands):\nThe following table summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the pension plan for the years ended April 30, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nThe Company recorded, net of tax, other comprehensive income of $564,000, including the pension settlement, net of tax, of $2,049,000 and $903,000 in 2020 and 2019 to account for the net effect of changes to the unfunded portion of pension liability.\nThe asset allocation for the pension plan by asset category was as follows:\nThe investment mix between equity securities and fixed income securities seeks to achieve a desired return by balancing equity securities and fixed-income securities. Pension plan assets are invested in portfolios of diversified public-market equity securities and fixed income securities. The pension plan holds no securities of the Company. Investment allocations are made across a range of markets, industry sectors, market capitalization sizes and, in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality.\nThe expected return on assets for the pension plan is based on management\u2019s expectation of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolio. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the pension plan is invested, as well as current economic and market conditions. For 2020, the Company used a 7.75% assumed rate of return for purposes of the expected return rate on assets for the development of net periodic pension costs for the pension plan. For years following 2020, the assumed rate of return for purposes of the expected return rate on assets is anticipated to be 7.75%.\nThe Company funds the pension plan in compliance with IRS funding requirements. The Company made voluntary contributions to the pension plan of $3,600,000 in 2020 and $2,000,000 in 2019. The Company is required to make minimum contributions to the pension plan; however, no minimum contributions are expected to be required during fiscal year 2021.\nThe amount of future annual benefit payments to pension plan participants payable from plan assets is expected to be as follows: 2021 - $2,506,000, 2022 - $1,769,000, 2023 - $1,710,000, 2024 - $1,637,000 and 2025 - $1,576,000 and an aggregate of $7,003,000 is expected to be paid in the fiscal five-year period 2026 through 2030.\nThe Company has adopted the disclosure requirements in ASC 715, which requires additional fair value disclosures consistent with those required by ASC 820. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for pension plan assets measured at fair value: common stock - valued at the closing price reported on a listed stock exchange; corporate bonds, debentures and government agency securities - valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow; and U.S. Treasury securities - valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the security is traded.\nThe methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. The following table sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy the pension plan\u2019s assets at fair value as of April 30, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nSimple IRA\nIn 2020, the Company established a Simple IRA plan as a retirement plan for eligible employees who earned at least $5,000 of annual compensation. Under the Simple IRA plan, eligible employees may contribute a portion of their pre-tax yearly salary, up to the maximum contribution limit for Simple IRA plans as set forth under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with the Company matching on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to 3% of the employees\u2019 annual pre-tax compensation. The Company\u2019s employer contribution was $14,000 for 2020.\nEquity compensation plans\nThe AMREP Corporation 2006 Equity Compensation Plan (the \u201c2006 Equity Plan\u201d) authorized stock-based awards of various kinds to non-employee directors and employees. The 2006 Equity Plan expired by its terms during fiscal year 2017 without affecting any existing awards under the 2006 Equity Plan, and no further awards may be granted under the 2006 Equity Plan. There were no awards issued under the 2006 Equity Plan that had not vested as of April 30, 2020.\nThe AMREP Corporation 2016 Equity Compensation Plan (the \u201c2016 Equity Plan\u201d) authorizes stock-based awards of various kinds to non-employee directors and employees covering up to a total of 500,000 shares of common stock of the Company. The 2016 Equity Plan will expire by its terms on, and no award will be granted under the 2016 Equity Plan on or after, September 19, 2026. As of April 30, 2020, the Company had 391,619 shares of common stock of the Company available for issuance under the 2016 Equity Plan.\nShares of restricted common stock that are issued under the equity plans (\u201crestricted shares\u201d) are considered to be issued and outstanding as of the grant date and have the same dividend and voting rights as other common stock. Compensation expense related to the restricted shares is recognized over the vesting period of each grant based on the fair value of the shares as of the date of grant. The fair value of each grant of restricted shares is determined based on the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of such grant, and this amount will be charged to expense over the vesting term of the grant. Forfeitures are recognized as reversals of compensation expense on the date of forfeiture.\nThe summary of the 2019 and 2020 restricted share award activity presented below represents the maximum number of shares issued to employees that could be vested:\nFor 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized $113,000 and $151,000 of compensation expense related to shares of restricted common stock issued to employees under the equity plans. As of April 30, 2020, there was $49,000 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to shares of common stock issued to employees under the equity plans, which will be recognized over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of one year.\nOn the last trading day of calendar year 2018, each non-employee member of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors was issued the number of deferred common share units of the Company under the 2016 Equity Plan equal to $20,000 divided by the closing price per share of Common Stock reported on the New York Stock Exchange on such date. Based on the closing price per share of $5.95 on December 31, 2018, the Company issued a total of 13,444 deferred common share units to members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors.\nOn the last trading day of calendar year 2019, each non-employee member of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors was issued the number of deferred common share units of the Company under the 2016 Equity Plan equal to $25,000 divided by the closing price per share of Common Stock reported on the New York Stock Exchange on such date. Based on the closing price per share of $5.98 on December 31, 2019, the Company issued a total of 16,720 deferred common share units to members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors.\nEach deferred common share unit represents the right to receive one share of Common Stock within 30 days after the first day of the month to follow such director\u2019s termination of service as a director of the Company. Director compensation expense is recognized for the annual grant of deferred common share units ratably over the director\u2019s service in office during the calendar year. The total non-cash director fee compensation related to the issued deferred common share units was $100,000 and $80,000 for 2020 and 2019. At April 30, 2020 and 2019, there was $33,000 and $27,000 of accrued compensation expense related to the deferred stock units expected to be issued in December of the following fiscal year.\n(12) INCOME TAXES:\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):\nThe components of the net deferred income taxes are as follows (in thousands):\nA valuation allowance is provided when it is considered more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance relates primarily to deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, in states where the Company either has no current operations or its operations are not considered likely to realize the deferred tax assets due to the amount of the applicable state net operating loss or its expected expiration date. The $262,000 increase in the valuation allowance in 2020 is related to the increase in state net operating losses that are not expected to be realizable.\nThe Company has federal net operating loss carryforwards of $17,838,000, of which $147,000 will expire beginning in 2038 and the remaining amount does not have an expiration. In addition, the Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $118,209,000 that expire beginning in fiscal year ending April 30, 2021.\nThe following table reconciles taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from continuing operations to the Company\u2019s actual tax provision (in thousands):\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxes and various state and local income taxes. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and require significant judgment to apply. The Company is not currently under examination by any tax authorities with respect to its income tax returns. Other than the U.S. federal tax return, in nearly all jurisdictions, the tax years through the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 are no longer subject to examination due to the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations.\nASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions, prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized, and providing guidance on the derecognition, measurement, classification and disclosure relating to income taxes. The following table summarizes the beginning and ending gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits:\nAs a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations, the Company\u2019s total tax effect of gross unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying financial statements of $58,000 at April 30, 2018 was recognized during 2019.\nThe Company has elected to include interest and penalties in its income tax expense. The Company had no accrued interest or penalties at April 30, 2020 and 2019.\n(13) INTEREST INCOME, NET:\nInterest income, net consists of:\n(14) LEASE COMMITMENTS:\nThe Company leases offices and office equipment in Pennsylvania and New Mexico. The leases are generally non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term of two to five years. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nAt April 30, 2020, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were $109,000 and $113,000. For the year ended April 30, 2020, the total operating lease expense was $113,000. Remaining lease payments subsequent to April 30, 2020 are as follows:\nFor 2020, the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate of the Company\u2019s operating leases were 1.2 years and 5.50%. The lease contracts for the Company generally do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. For these contracts, the Company estimated the incremental borrowing rate based on information available upon the adoption of ASU 2016-02. The Company applied a consistent method in periods after the adoption of ASU 2016-02 to estimate the incremental borrowing rate.\n(15) OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:\nPursuant to a support agreement, the Company agreed through May 2023 to pay up to $250,000 to the Smithsonian Institution if PCD fails to provide certain required services to the Smithsonian Institution. The parent company of PCD has guaranteed the payment of this amount to the Company.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. Subsequently, the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to spread and various state and local governments have issued or extended \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, which have impacted and restricted various aspects of the Company\u2019s operations. While the Company cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of this pandemic or if there will be additional periods of increases or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which the Company operates, an extended economic slowdown could materially impact the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated cash flows in fiscal year 2021 or beyond.\n(16) LITIGATION:\nRefer to Note 2 for a description of litigation involving PCD. The Company is involved in various pending or threatened claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. While the ultimate results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that they will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\n(17) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS:\nSettlement of Litigation. Refer to Note 2 for a description of litigation involving PCD and a settlement agreement entered in May 2020.\nFinancing Facility. In June 2020, Lavender Fields, LLC (\u201cLF\u201d), a subsidiary of the Company, acquired approximately 28 acres in Bernalillo County, New Mexico comprising the Meso AM subdivision, which is planned for 82 residential lots.\n\u00b7 Acquisition Financing. The acquisition included $1,838,000 of deferred purchase price, of which $919,000 is payable on or before June 2021 and $919,000 is payable on or before June 2022. The deferred purchase price is evidenced by a non-interest bearing Promissory Note and is secured by a Mortgage, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing with respect to the acquired property. The lien of the mortgage on any portion of the property will be released as to such property upon payment of that percentage of the then unpaid principal balance of the Promissory Note equal to the number of acres of land within the property being released divided by the number of acres of land within the property then remaining encumbered by the mortgage (including the property being released). Any prepayment shall be credited toward the next payment due under the Promissory Note.\nLF made certain representations and warranties in connection with this loan and is required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar loans. The loan documentation contains customary events of default for similar financing transactions, including: LF\u2019s failure to make principal or other payments when due; the failure of LF to observe or perform their covenants under the loan documentation; and the representations and warranties of LF being false. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the outstanding principal amount and all other obligations under the loan may be declared immediately due and payable.\n\u00b7 Development Financing. In June 2020, LF entered into a Development Loan Agreement with BOKF. The Development Loan Agreement is evidenced by a Non-Revolving Line of Credit Promissory Note and is secured by a Mortgage, Security Agreement and Financing Statement, between LF and BOKF with respect to the acquired property. Pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement entered into by ASW in favor of BOKF, ASW has guaranteed LF\u2019s obligations under each of the above agreements.\no Initial Available Principal: BOKF agrees to lend up to $3,750,000 to LF on a non-revolving line of credit basis to partially fund the development of the acquired property.\no Repayments: LF is required to make periodic principal repayments of borrowed funds not previously repaid as follows: $657,500 on or before March 19, 2022; $394,500 on or before June 19, 2022; $394,500 on or before September 19, 2022; $394,500 on or before December 19, 2022; $394,500 on or before March 19, 2023; $394,500 on or before June 19, 2023; $394,500 on or before September 19, 2023; $394,500 on or before December 19, 2023; and $331,000 on or before March 19, 2024. The outstanding principal amount of the loan may be prepaid at any time without penalty. On the maturity date, LF will be required to make a final payment of all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest.\no Maturity Date: The loan is scheduled to mature in June 2024.\no Interest Payments: Interest on the outstanding principal amount of the loan is payable monthly at the annual rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate for a thirty-day interest period plus a spread of 3.0%, adjusted monthly, subject to a minimum interest rate of 3.75%.\no Lot Release Price: BOKF is required to release the lien of its mortgage on any lot upon LF making a principal payment of $65,750.\nLF and ASW have made certain representations and warranties in connection with this loan and are required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar loans. The loan documentation contains customary events of default for similar financing transactions, including: LF\u2019s failure to make principal, interest or other payments when due; the failure of LF or ASW to observe or perform their respective covenants under the loan documentation; the representations and warranties of LF or ASW being false; the insolvency or bankruptcy of LF or ASW; and the failure of ASW to maintain a tangible net worth of at least $32 million. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, BOKF may declare the outstanding principal amount and all other obligations under the loan immediately due and payable. LF incurred certain customary costs and expenses and paid certain fees to BOKF in connection with the loan.",
